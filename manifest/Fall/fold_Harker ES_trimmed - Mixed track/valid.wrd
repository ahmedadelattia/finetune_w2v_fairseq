okay yes 0 this is going to happen this is the are you trying not to look at yes she keeps looking back and she keeps looking at me so tegan to finish answering your question yes you can do that and you will still end up with the same solution daniel go ahead okay this the last one now what is the error and what can be corrected garia
0 so i did 9 -16 is equals to -7 all right so that is what i needed to see how did you get from here to here okay thank you so
could you go over number 6 because i got number 6 number 6 remind me of the page please 0 209 209 okay whoop got it 209 number 6 209
i can divide both sides well remember that is the number this is the variable term i am trying to isolate that variable so what i can do here you can divide both by -50 over 21
okay i will add one half on both sides okay so then i have 2 sevenths x is equal to 2 thirds times x 4 x -one +one half and then you can expand it so
i can divide both the top and bottom by 3 so i have x 7 over what 100 7 over 100 so i could do that right we have all of this and we got to our final answer what did you get
0 you move the variable term to the okay if i subtract 3 a -3 a i end up with 6 is equal to -8 so wait but then you are kind of so is that a true statement no so then when we have something like this there is no solution yes pretty
well i divided both sides by 3 because i got 36 is equal to 3 x okay and then i need to divide both sides by 3 and that gives me x is equal to 12 amant so what would happen on number one if you multiply both sides by 3
+12 is equal to 6 a -0 16 okay no yeah -28 because yeah because you would subtract 12 from both sides because it is 68 +12 or you
all right so i have 2 sevenths x is equal to 8 thirds x -16th what is next
do i need to make it bigger for you tian i am fine there let us see i will try it always looks larger on my screen than it does on the on the big screen is that a little bit better yeah they are huge
you can multiply them both by 21 multiply both sides by 21 yeah no never mind
but is not it what we just did in the one yesterday
so i have 620 firsts x -and then what is 7 times 8 56 okay and that is equal to -one sixths okay so then where do i go from here rudy then you subtract 56 from 6
okay yeah i had paused it okay that is fine okay all right that is all right if we are not done we will just go over these together so for the 1st one what should i do who can tell me okay tian walk me through
well if you subtracted 2 thirds from both sides all you are really doing is moving the numbers back and forth because remember the 2 thirds v is a variable term and then the other 2 are numbers what is it 4 thirds so are you saying to subtract this on both sides yeah is that possible
entire class i got stuck on the order yeah i tried i did get 2.9 r equals 6.7 m that makes sense 0 wow that is cool 0 wow that is so fancy okay all right how far are we on this i am done i
all right so i have 115 is equal to 25 r and now i can divide both sides by 25 and i can reduce if i need to yes so i will have r is equal to so what is the common factor between these 2 the largest common factor between these 255 okay so what is 115 divided by 5
okay so that is something we need to make sure we know so that is why whatever we are doing having an indicator of what we are doing would be helpful so i go ahead amant so can i just make it positive
multiplying it by the reciprocal of 2 sevenths you will still end up with a fraction if you just multiply by the reciprocal so you just need to multiply it by the denominator correct since we have just one fraction i am trying to eliminate that fraction okay so then tegan for yours so what was your question for number 25 -42 correct
yay yay all right clean up
it is trying to find me you can do it we just want to go back to that color looks really nice okay there we go yay yay me yes there could be a nursery rhyme i do not understand 4 and 6 i tried expanding it i tried not expanding it but it does not make sense
could we use so we get to 2 sevenths x -2 sevenths x equals to x that would be -one sevenths can we do 42 i could do 42 but what would that value you would still end up with your same solution but i could also multiply each of them by 42 to get rid of
on this side yeah 15 -4 a equals 6 which then would you do -15 from both sides so you get -4 a equals -9 and then would you divide by -4
yeah so 209 number 6 so number 6 says 2 thirds v is equal to 2 minus something okay so we have 2 thirds v is equal to 2 -4 thirds mister chase huh i added 4 thirds to both sides and it is well here we need to simplify 1st because we have
would you still multiply by
and then would you multiply it by the same thing you got 3 so i would multiply this side by 3 and then multiply that by 3 yes
okay sure yeah what is it 23 it is not 23 23 okay 115 divided by 23 so 23 and then what is 25 divided by 5 5 all right so then we have r is equal to 23 fifths i can leave it as an improper fraction or i can turn it into a mixed number which would give me 4 and 3 fifths that is our answer i thought r equals 5.5 so did i get something wrong
okay or multiply by 21 over 50 by -21 over 50 because these 2 would cancel these 2 would cancel then i have x is equal to and then -one sixths times 21 or -21 over 50 and then what do i have what is 21 -one times 21 and then 6 times 50 is what
well if you did that i would divide here by 4 and i will divide here by 4 so then i will have on the left hand side x is equal to x over 4 +9 so then that is also correct
well no that is not the answer because we have not solved for x yet because i still have this equation here x over 4 +9 is equal to x so i still have not solved for x yet yes please for number 5 if you minus x from the would it be as 36 equals 3 x
i both sides by 2 and then i got 12 minus x and then equals one.2 one.6 and one.2 is and i subtracted 12 from both sides and just got -one is 10.8 and here you can just say we will subtract both sides by -one and then get x is 10.8
so 2 sevenths times 42 would just be 12 because 7 goes into 426 times so it will just be 12 x for that one then we will have to see how many times does 3 go into 42 it goes in 14 times
0 i forgot there we go wonderful what did i do with my clicker there it is thank you sia okay do we have any questions on our homework from last class yes tegan
do we have to wait for number 5 how would you get 12 because is not it x +36 divided by 4 remember i subtracted x on both sides so if i have 4 x minus x gives me 3 x and then 36 divided by 3 gives me 120 so you can not do an x +36 divided by 4
yeah so we have 2 numbers so we would need to simplify for this one so here it would be 6 over 3 okay so then i have 2 thirds v is equal to 6 over 3 -4 over 3 so i need to simplify that or before i even continue with this 0 i was correct i thought the correct answer
so i do not know if this is an error but what i wrote was because it expanded so when you are expanding you need to keep in mind the sign so when you do -2 times negative y the answer will be positive because it is 2 negatives yes is that the only error is it i do not know i just went past right there and i am like okay that is the error right there right
okay so just do what you think and then we are going to go over it all right what
well if i subtract x on both sides and if i have x minus x +36 is equal to 4 x minus x what is x minus x a 0 so yes so it is but how do you get rid of the x just say x is equal to 12
all right well obviously we can okay then i can move here on 5 here on 6 how are we doing liam what do you have everything but 4 everything but 4 and 2 i did not finish 2
okay and then that is equal to 67 r +53 so now the one thing you should keep in mind when you are doing this always move the smaller variable term to the larger variable term so i will do -42 r on both sides so now i have 67 r -42 r yes why do you do that yeah wait why would you do that for the variable thing
so i can add -2 thirds +one half so what would that give me i am just going to continue to rewrite 2 sevenths here x is equal to 8 x over 3 -4 sixths and that is going to be 4 sixths +3 sixths so 7 sixths and what does that give me 7 sixths 0 -16th
yes i know negative divided by a negative is a positive okay negative is +and wait wait is a not negative a is not negative because remember i am dividing by -4 on both sides so then i have here and i have -9 divided by -4 which would give me a positive so i have that would be including
okay so walk me through you and i will go through with it so what would i do what should i do so you could subtract one half from both sides okay i can subtract one half from both sides but remember if i do that wait no you can add one half
25 25 yeah okay we have 25 r +53 and then i will subtract 53 on both sides so i have 168 -53 so i have 10 110 the one and then 5 115
correct all right what about for 3 tegan come on up so talk us through it also
so i have 4 ninths and i can reduce it to 2 and 14 if i need to but improper fractions are okay yeah you can turn it into a decimal too if you want but there is no need to were we supposed to solve that
okay so what you just said right there all right could i have done that in the beginning would that have worked yeah it could have is 21 divisible by 2 no
so you 1st change it to equals and change the 5 sixths to 15 over 18 so why would i change the 5 sixths to 15 over 18 so it is easier to to 13rd would not it be easier to change the 13rd 0 yeah i forgot about that that is okay it is equivalent to 2 sixths
i have a question about the test go ahead did you post the answers but our grade i have not not yet it will be posted today and then it will be handed to you all tomorrow 0 but that is not within the week wait tomorrow
yes but i will double check your work yes i did not multiply it by 10 then i used the decimals and i got 4.6 r which is the i mean r equals 4.6 that is what you would get because 4 and 3 fifths is can i do that way or this way
yeah i understood that right correct so what are you deciding to do so what did you decide to do
yes it is the whole thing okay then how do i do x divided by 4 well now you have a fraction it is 14th x so then you would have to okay so then i will not do that next time i mean you can it is just you are adding a bit more complexity for you into 6 is
so how did we get what is that this no i am saying what is this number 720 fourths so how would you get a -720 fourths
do we have to do that do what the times 7 and times 7 you do not have to but it makes your work a bit more efficient and easier to work with but it is up to you all right tegan and when you you do that would you put parenthesis on that yeah hold that question just for a moment garia do you have a question for one yeah can you just multiply it by the inverse
i am sorry do not worry daniel 0 this is a dumb question which track are you on huh this is a dumb question but no i should not it is malfunctioning 0 we are going around in a circle it is tracking all it is malfunctioning
so what should you do for that one i think that i do not have to do it that way i am just asking what are you doing for that one i am minusing this and i am going to minus that so subtracting 6 on both sides wait do i have to subtract 6 from the whole thing well that is a variable term that is a numeral so you can not subtract 6 from
multiply both sides by 15 multiply both sides by 15 and why would i do that liam because if you just multiply it by 5 the fraction 13rd would become one and 2 thirds
okay so i know i am going to subtract 13rd from both sides and i have here 5 sixths -13rd is equal to d so now i can change this to give me 5 sixths -2 sixths is equal to d so what is 5 -2 5 -2 is 3
yeah you can leave it as decimals or you can turn it into whole numbers i always show the option to turn into whole numbers because sometimes people do not like to work with decimals but yeah go ahead come on i have a question on number one okay so could you also multiply both sides by 3 you can if but it would make it harder though right
yes so we are wrapping up the lesson all right so we went over solving equations with fractions and decimals so what are some things all right we need to keep in mind when we are solving so when solving it is important to perform the order of operations in reverse by adding or subtracting before we multiply and divide just like we were doing i thought if it is we have to simplify it
i multiplied both sides by 3 instead of 15 but i still got the same answer that is fine it probably took you a few more steps to get to that solution and then so for this last one what can we do or 2nd to last one what can we do we have 3 fractions 3 different denominators that it is not quite clear for what we can do rudy what do you think what would you decide to do for 3 i did not get to 3
it is possible you will end up with 0 here is equal to 2 -4 thirds -2 thirds v wait but does not v equal remember it is -4 thirds -2 thirds
yes they are all graded i just have not had the time to put them in the grade book yet if you want to come after school you can grab them after school really yes so during like after my lunch during office hours you can grab them during office hours if you need to wait can we come during lunch during lunch it will not be inputted during lunch because guess what i got to eat lunch yeah but can we come and get it during lunch you actually eat during lunch
okay so you -60 on both sides okay what number is that 54
think about that did we forget something 0 we made a
okay and i get -50 all right okay do not forget and then where do i go from here and then you can divide both by -one sixths
okay i can expand it so i am just going to start here to 2 sevenths x is equal to and then i have 8 thirds x -2 thirds +one half okay and then you can add -2 thirds +one half
okay i have 3 sixths is equal to d which would then be a half is equal to d so that should be my solution for that one so then what about the 2nd one all right go up and talk us through what you are doing
yeah okay so is it okay if i represent yeah that is fine so talk us through what are you doing eliza
0 too much thank you
300 wait what about the remember i am multiplying both sides so they cancel out so i have x is equal to 21 over 300 can i reduce from there maybe yeah 0 yeah yeah yeah you can okay what can i reduce them by you can divide both the top and bottom by 3
you can make both the denominators 21
but you can do that you can because remember i am doing the same thing to both sides of the equation keeping it balanced and now i can either distribute the 42 to both of these terms or i can divide the 42 on both sides so let us distribute so i have 42 r +and what is 42 times 4 168
so for number 6 i expanded the 2 parentheses 3 a so this expression on the right hand side okay yeah but once i expanded it then i subtracted 12 from both sides because yeah and then i got 6 a equals 6 a -20
a on 2 sides yes okay so if you subtract 6 a on both sides then you have 0 is equal to -28 which is still a false statement that means you do not have a solution for this one so then tian so for number 4 to make it a non decimal do you just times 10 by both sides correct it would just multiply garia did you finish asking your question yeah okay and then aliyah
yeah yeah i sometimes lose track of time yeah if you subtract 13rd do you have to subtract it from this and this or just one so you are subtracting 13rd from both sides yeah
you can but just imply that you are going to multiply both sides by -one yeah so that will turn the answer positive
well this is just saying to keep in mind it is important to perform those operations in reverse so if i have an example here let us say 2 x -5 is equal to 10 i am going to add 5 to both sides before because usually you would multiply and then but why can not you do 2 x divided by 2 and then you reverse it well so if i yeah yeah why can not you do that
i can make both the denominators 21 okay so i can move this over so i have 2 sevenths x -8 thirds x is equal to -one sixths so i can make both the denominators 21 i am just going to move this up here just so we have a bit more room to work with so then what did i have to multiply 7 by to get 21 3
would you check my work on number 5 i do not know what i did wrong all right so while i check that sia can you erase the board for me it was kind of untidy but on number 5 i did x +36 equals 4 x then i did x +36 divided by 4 so that is the error right there because you forgot to divide x by 4 because all you did was divide x by 360 it is all that okay
is the answer one yeah that is what i got yes the answer is one i got it correct i did a different i did a different i added 4 thirds to what was and i had 6 thirds and i divided by 6 thirds on both sides and got one could you subtract 2 thirds from both sides and then solve it
no this was me going over this for you all yeah so this is with fractions keep in mind what i just talked about what you should do what you can do do you have to do it no but it is helpful to do it okay so solve these ones 0 now we can do it
okay but i could also find a common denominator for these 3 to kind of eliminate those fractions if i wanted to so this is not incorrect you get to your answer too tegan yes
yes just check your work again so why would you multiply both okay so you multiply both sides by 10 okay good good and then what would you do here -60
the g is for the 1st one so i multiply the so what did you do from here to get to here i multiplied one.5 by 2 okay so make sure you show that okay okay so i multiply them both by this
i know it is amazing how teachers have to eat okay mister yes for the test will you have to write it in decimal because for this 1st question no i wrote in fractions okay you are fine can i go to the bathroom
where would you get 1242 x 0 it is because so this would 2 sevenths
well either or with this one you would end up with 0 is equal to -28 which is still a false statement what so you will still end up with 0 as equal to -28 so you said you subtracted 12 on both sides yes and then so you are left with i am just going to move it up here 6 a is equal to 6 a -28 yes yeah and then you subtracted 6 a on both sides
