no we are not do your best okay can i have these 312 and 3 go ahead and write something on the board i do not want you to use those if it is not for class purposes so erase it and put yeah do you ever yawn do you ever have regular and then everyone says you are crying when you are not yeah exactly nobody is ever said that to me
the idea you are talking about between an equation and inequality is that we need more than 0 yeah i mean you can yeah someone was definitely saying that earlier they were like well do not you always flip the sign just with an equal sign it does not matter
integer integers and rational rational so remember so are all integers rational numbers yeah no yes yes so can someone actually explain this venn diagram because this is the one we used in class it is actually wrong what it is actually wrong 0 i want to hear this yeah wait what you just said all integers were rational 0 no my bad
all right now is your time some of these answer keys or problems sorry answers on the answer key were wrong so let us just it is not simplified just to think so that was wrong and this one is wrong about 36 -7 and she still did not finish she is not it beautiful i think it is beautiful too yeah you got the best in the world do you think so i just changed the ink
every single time i have a secret paper my pencil breaks 0 that is interesting correlation is not causation all right great it is a work that we only have the paper is translucent or transparent or whatever translucent
0 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what did you get for number 3 is that a one there why is it in his hand so flip the wait are you doing the homework no i am just checking answers do homework already i think so it is tough to imagine i can double check 0 okay 0 i am stupid
a rational number can not be negative right it can be negative yeah yeah yeah we are going to go over those too and then also on the test will there be anything like explain and we have to write in sentences no i just like doing these because it helps us to understand better
whole number yeah so it is a whole number and rational but it is not just rational so you really want to look at the most simplified version of the number you have is there another category called natural numbers yeah but we are not going to yeah i love all your questions but sometimes we have other stuff to do yeah so then square roots of negatives what kind of are they irrational complex but let us not talk about it yeah
one side is integer and then the other side is the whole number that is right so this is integer yeah right can you raise your hand if you are done with one and 2 no i got 7 6 and a 4 okay take a little more time i forgot to do number 2 fraction i definitely can
how did you do 6 today i got this yeah i got yeah because you forgot to distribute the negative we distribute the negative so then y is on the 0 this is the same as -3 x 0 it was minus yeah i forgot yeah either or that is fine no i forgot -5 x existed you cover your own back no no no no no at least i made sure this was positive no no no
we should solve the easiest problem 1st what solve the easiest problem solve the easiest 1st solve the bonus 1st no but the bonus is so much easier than all
ism okay i think it was
because if it is in the smaller category the smaller category fits in the bigger category which is in an even bigger category so that number is in all the categories yeah exactly yeah and we can see how that works just in the venn diagram sorry not the same as the typical ones we see where we have 2 and then some overlap between but we actually have whole categories contained in other whole categories so that should definitely help so integers are always in both integers and rational numbers what number of categories is 0 in
whole whole integers integers and rational it is in whole also whole whole did he say it was +and 0 that is not okay and bringing it back up here what about pi what are the number categories for pi irrational
9 times 0 my nail the division same why did you no you have to sound more confident do you know what that means you have to sound more confident what is wrong with us it is just i do not have our lecture back on can you tell us just something to make it
yeah 100.5 is 100.5 an integer no 0 yeah
yeah they have to be whenever you are done writing feel free to share what you wrote with your group and then we will talk about it as a class
rational whole numbers yeah well i guess they can be no one told me about what about 9 over 9 that is an integer yeah yes yeah
no one is ever said that no people have asked me that before and can i have my 0 wait nevermind are you crying are you mad at me can you put steven can you put the yeah this is fine can i have you put those 3 on those 3 desks in the back back in the middle face down those 3 so the one with jerry
yeah because it is not written okay that is a good point yeah when do you have to flip the inequality when does it have to happen isha when multiplying or dividing by a negative great okay so that is our main and remember with inequalities you also get a range of values for 2 this looks good i would not expect to see common errors here actually maybe some decimal division like decimal in the wrong place but that is about it what do you think the common error would be here andrew yeah you do not convert it into a mixed number
yes absolutely so if you look on the math quote board in the back one of them is always remember to distribute the negative for exactly this reason so make sure you are doing that i actually was just grading some algebra one tests and students for sure made this mistake so it is a great thing to remember okay last one we have a word problem when we have a word problem what should we always include in our answer units units or in this case votes votes
it is not but it still counts as a whole number so what is it was there any question so then pi would be pi is irrational so we have not technically talked about irrational numbers even though we kind of have in a way but you could just say it is none of them it is not in any of the categories
irrational is we have talked about it as in we have talked about it the book has not talked about it and of course yeah it does you can say irrational if you want i will accept irrational can i say none you can say none pi is none right pi is none what did you do to them good for you
so good so good do you need a marker the markers yeah 0 i know it is really inky i know 0 no it is okay i am okay with this 10 the marker is integer so let us start off with a review of just the number groups we have 3 number groups what are the 3 number groups that we talked about steven
cool looks good wait ms nelson wait for number 3 what go on the camera will you ever be on camera i have to walk over there i got that wrong because remember it all he did he just did no 4 and 3 fourths
yeah especially if it is a common error if i know 30% of students are going to do this then i should probably ask you to remember it i am still going to do it anyways you still you know what is funny actually i have done this myself a couple of times but i hope that me i know
no isha you have not been on the board today right you have not done anything on the board okay go ahead and do it yeah you get it wait did what occurred my mom would not allow it i was supposed to go back into the classroom i guess i did not ask this but you chose to accept accept it you would
number one andrew which one do you want 33 and then laura is 2 okay okay great let us get those on the board since you have done these already go ahead and talk about them in your groups check your answers make sure you have labels all those good things for number one i actually all right problem what did you get for number one x is less than or equal to 9 yeah so what she got the julia julia what did you get for one
come over here okay i myself like so many times in this class also have to try to not get distracted because sometimes i think things are fun too okay so can you raise your hand if you have finished the 4 problems on the board we have okay great can you raise your hand if you would like to do one on the board cool let us have devia which one do you want number 44 okay ivanka number one
here you go this is for you ms nelson can you come here are you writing here how about you write and i will walk around wait not to me not to me could you go the other way i am not going to go all the way 0 but i do not need to right as long as you stay there
irrational or okay so secret or there was a secret that was breached a little bit because really we are not supposed to be talking about irrational numbers but we are anyway so given that you do not know irrational numbers what could we say about pi none none okay it is not in any of the categories what about -one.3 repeating integer not an integer decimal decimals are not integers
wait if the original quote is from andrew does not that mean it should say andrew yeah i think it should i think that people maybe did not know that it was from someone erased these yeah i know i can change it that is fine are you ready what is our motto
yeah for inequality it is range and for equations number yeah yeah just one number exactly okay and then common mistakes which i hope no one does this we have talked about this so many times now julia by not distributing the negative
secret paper i love the secret paper yeah what if i accidentally write 0 my god are you okay i almost got you 0 my god secret paper secret paper it is such a big deal i am so scared i know right okay we are not writing on this yet right so write secret paper on the back i am going to need to give you this you got another secret paper
3.9 repeating also a whole number yes right yeah so you do have to be careful to simplify you really would not write you would not use that as a number if you were doing a problem unless you wanted to be sneaky for some reason so yeah i would say do not write 3.9 repeating as 3.9 repeating you would write that as 4 yeah can i use the restroom
it does not face down it does not go down no i guess not the number you will have to figure out a way to be famous rational
0 is a whole no i am asking are whole numbers nonnegative whole numbers have to be positive no whole numbers have to be positive except 11 is not positive what one is not necessarily positive or negative what positive i think you are thinking 0 do not you mean 0 you mean 0 you mean 0 yeah 0 is not positive you said 100 my whole life is a lie i said one that is okay you know what all of our brains fart sometimes
it is a weird fraction of what 2 each
wait so you are saying you can also flip the equality 10 someone said that earlier i think that is why i was asking how do you know you can yeah the one in the center on the center no there is one on the center the idea
yeah can you raise your hand if you were going to say that ratio of 2 integers okay that is the official definition i just say that because if you have one.6 over 3 that is not quite enough to show that it is a rational number so you want to have actually integers for that and then we talked about this but one key difference between solving an equation and solving an inequality is what ivanka with inequalities if you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number the sign has to flip definitely maya
yeah so it is kind of an unknown value just like how the value is we just do not know the value we also do not know what number category it is in okay what is an example of a whole number 0 wait sorry what is an example of an integer that is not a whole number matthew -3 -3 okay -100 huh steven -one -one alright 100.5 100.5
okay so those are your 5 numbers make sure you are being careful about all of the number groups that each of them are a part of and then go ahead and convert those 2 so we have one fraction or sorry decimal to fraction one fraction to decimal yeah would this whole number be nonnegative or positive a whole number has to be +0 and 0 if that is your question yeah that is nonnegative 0 is rational 0 is it is not positive nonnegative but is 0 but is 0 a whole number
flipping that sign or forgetting that -one counts as a number when it is i do not know but i got negative x was less than or equal to -9 so not flipping the sign or forgetting -one and you are saying it is even harder when it is negative x versus -2 x yeah you might forget that it is there it is
study come to office hours and because you are taking your test on wednesday actually there are also office hours tomorrow i will be here for that too i do not know and one of the things yeah so office hours today or office hours tomorrow either is fine yeah 32 -7 i forgot how to do that i gave up i feel stupid no in the middle of the speed run yeah okay i did not know so ivanka can you talk
on this chapter so far you are actually a big help yeah no no no we got damon is favorite food spot the same
but then 0 when we say is going to be on camera recorded but would 0 be a whole number what do we do if they are none wait if they are none you can write none yeah sometimes there might be a number that is not in any of the categories wait okay i am ready is 0 a whole number
he never actually consented ms nelson i often have trouble with the whole number how do you classify it and how do you and then how to classify integer wait so integer is always positive right
right okay distribute the negative this actually acts as a grouping symbol the fraction bar so it is like there are parentheses here and then you are distributing the negative to both of those things so if that helps you remember then that would be great okay so more on rational numbers there we go okay so we have some numbers that are definitely not allowed here but i will write them here so let me just give you a couple of examples 1st
0 yeah you can do all i have not talked hey give me a you are going to get canceled hi i have not talked about stuffed animal rules enough in this class but if you want one he just has to be yours only 0 wait i forgot to do the rest of the ivanka sorry i want to be famous
the rational you have whole number well not whole numbers integers right and then whole numbers okay sounds good if a number is a whole number is it always an integer yes yes okay if a number is a rational number is it always an integer no okay what is an example of a rational number that is not an integer laura
yeah so with a variable we do not know what x is until we figure out what it is so it is like undefined not undefined more like unknown in a variable form so what would it be then it depends on what the value of the variable is so it is never really but if you do not know the value which one would it no then you just do not know you would not classify it as anything so we will not put it in the column
wait do we have any last questions on these as far as the are we feeling ready yes for tomorrow yes for your test that you are going to have no we have been studying all class today no i did not wow it is a strong word in the last 30 seconds i forgot how to do 27 -5
so for the test if you put this then for example 9 would you put it is whole integer and rational yes so you would put all 3 all of them so you have to put all the categories yes okay but could you just put whole could we do that no no you are going to lose a point no you have to because it is in other categories too yeah
i think i can i am proud of myself good for you what i thought click click click click click splash splash would come back and
so i did this in a different order in my earlier classes so this is a little bit different but that is okay i want to talk about some kind of conceptual common mistakes that i would see on some of these problems so let us go through this one by one what do you think a common mistake would be here what do you always have to remember that people forget to do steven
yeah it is supposed to be on the desk do you need anything else because actually class is going to be over in 8 seconds yes we are good you do need to be careful to not knock it over i was not okay be careful to not knock it over i will see you on
can i give it a go express yourself 0 yes please with the homework with the homework i thought that is nice that we have an hour and a half okay it did you not get or are you 6 where did you get 6
i got 152 over 99 i am not sure wait what would you get very big what i did that myself no you did not thanks for the answer i never said that no you just i did that myself can i have 2 and 3 on the board 2 and then 3
yeah no trading of in class just peer pressure sorry andrew i was never famous you want to be famous there is nothing you can do about it do not put jerry in jerry has the camera i found the camera you did not no but i found the camera earlier in class i found the camera let us leave jerry alone yeah jerry did not sign the how about you do the math problems
and so then and set up at us and she has got she got 60 you got 60 that is not appropriate that is 110 my bad how do you do that
0.5 repeated true one.2 what was it one.2 yeah one.2 ivanka i have a question yeah are variables rational numbers or irrational that is a good question so what do we think rational irrational it depends it depends anything yeah it depends on its value it could be both
0 yeah yeah i will go back yeah yeah we can be a little more detailed than that though so it is not just a fraction well a fraction because say one.6 over 2 is kind of a fraction but that is not quite enough to say that something is rational
wait are you 0 i the wrong one it is mine do you know how to do number 4 you can not are you saying because these cancel out 0 okay well that one it would have to cancel with this too so if you divide by 9 this would also have to by 9 ms nelson can you double check if number 6 is done right yeah 6 is done right this is correct what did you distribute the -6 how did she do 6 this is correct
is 0 a whole number or an integer 0 is both but it is whole so you can have it in whole yes yeah so 0 one is only a rational number but nothing else 0 one yeah that is right yeah so if it is a so if it is a fraction then it has to be rational unless it is like 0.999 right
can i speed run it speed run it yeah
i did i did do that in so it is very easy to do so let us go through these together how do you show that a number is rational yeah matthew if you can convert it to a fraction yeah so it does have to be a fraction but let us be more specific than that jc a ratio of 2 integers
that is so annoying the splashing that is not a like that i got what did you guys get little i got i got yeah but if you simplify it it is you got that
the one with jerry those 3 yes the what yes 0 wait hold on you do it less funny i am much better yeah secret if you can write secret paper on the secret paper
0 that is true i actually do not mind improper fractions if there are variables in the equation i am fine with the improper fraction because usually remember what we talked about it gets kind of messy like if you have 4.5 x this is adding and this is multiplying so i do not love that yeah caitlin distributing the x -3 like the -2 like this yeah
yeah or one or 5 you want to look at the most simplified form but you do not have to worry about it wait one it is a decimal i mean some of these i have not done this in this class but i used to talk about this in my classes so if i have say 24 over 6 what is this 4 4 which is a whole number
it is so cool cool clap your hands okay all right now you are good to do whatever you want did they have to clap 3 times or no no no no just you yeah okay wow this is so odd i do not know you can not see this but this means that i can see myself at all times because it is recording can see yeah here let us just play with this for a 2nd sorry is this okay wow yeah am i just completely ruining academic integrity here wait wait get us another let me see my why can not we do this i want to see it
can we measure what we think so i do not know about that we can measure people is beliefs and votes
no it is not yeah it is no i know but it is easy it is like jc 0 toast i will think about it do you ever yawn when you lie not me that is so embarrassing do the easiest problems 1st
maybe one category is more open than the other so it can fit both okay wait it can fit both can you explain more for example if it is 5 it fulfills all 3 yeah so how does its placement in the venn diagram tell you that it is in all 3 categories 0 yeah go ahead
yeah i might consider are you okay with writing a common denominator for we got 9 number one okay that is 11 okay do you still remember how to do them i can take a stab at it i do not really know how okay let me know when you are yes even no but wait i got it wrong i got 9 x is supposed to be greater than yeah 9 you are supposed to flip this it is literally 9 is in the brackets right yeah so that stays in the bracket
no integers can be both +and negative whole numbers are only positive so think about counting numbers in 0 so one 2 3 4 etc so is this a whole number yes yes because eventually if you count out for long enough you would get there and then the negative version of this is an integer and this is an integer do you remember the venn diagram that we had so what is inside is rational outside is rational outside is rational yes
votes yeah okay votes is votes a unit no yeah yeah you think votes it a unit anything can be a unit anything okay anything can be a unit but remember unit do we know what units stand for what is the full thing because unit is actually a shortened version units of measurement measurement yeah is this a unit of measurement yes
yeah i can not just try and recognize the sound
we are good so can someone explain no irrational but okay and refocusing up here i know today is just too fun so how does this venn diagram work so based on the placement of a number how can you tell not only the one number group that something is in but the several number groups that something is in matthew
