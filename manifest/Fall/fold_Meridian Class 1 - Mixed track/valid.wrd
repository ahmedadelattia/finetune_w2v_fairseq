180 i disagree because 180 is a straight line 0 that is why yeah and you are doing that so it is a 90 degree angle all right do we agree with that so what bradley is saying 0 i think we agree and i think zion was like 0 yeah and i heard him say also that it was 90 you have another thought yeah what is your thought i feel as if you knew it was going to be a 90 degree angle you should have went like this because as this it is the one that l shape
see it overlapped so whatever that is okay that is absolutely it so ready what you want to do here is match up this with this okay so this is not really connected to this one yet so what we are going to do all right we are going to take this we want to make sure c matches up here so we are going to go 121 okay does that make sense so the cs need to match up with each other
awesome actually amber you do not need to mark it down you can just hold it like that all right thank you all right show me if yours looks like amber is looks show i agree beautiful all right let us try another one thank you i think we are getting the hang of it mine is looks exactly just like that
4 what numbers do you need 100 you did not ask you are not ready what numbers do you need i need one 8 and i need 19 one 8 you need hold on 4 hold on 7 and 16 only 14 and 13
it is on volume but it is not breaking up yeah it is pick another one i think we have to hear it right otherwise it does not really it is not satisfying

ooh can you make a rhombus i love that shape can you make a rhombus that is a good question we might be able to answer that any other questions we have josiah what are they for ooh what is this even for what do we use this for what is this even for any other wonders amber and then i will go to bradley
i could move where it is
yeah 90 degrees yeah but it is like a 90 degree angle is like this is a 90 degree angle like this no i said like this closed yours is straight it looks like that one vertical angle no not
okay you added the hands crossed and the bubble but that is fine we are sitting silently where should the computers go when you are done with your exit ticket jermaine the blue desk the blue desk beautiful all right all right my friends so we are going to do that now orange tagged people come on over and i will help you make sure you are communicating what computer do you need i am number one please and ask a friend ask corbin what one go ask corbin and zion which numbers they need
the glass breaking you want to watch a glass breaking video no way yeah okay hold on we will do one glass breaking video do you want to do that yeah we want to watch a glass breaking video yes yes okay we got to be quiet which one top or bottom tiktok tiktok tiktok okay okay sh we got to be quiet i follow him on tiktok hold on i am sorry i am sorry it is on volume
yeah you can mark it down too let me give you a marker all right check your work with amber damari kanye no thank you we do not need to touch each other so please stop all right we are watching amber move it 0 amber i think mine is too big up there so just do your best it is too small
all right so brenda says we can cut them out and we can measure them there so she says 60 degrees is her answer 0 you want to build on yeah all right build on a easier way to do it is 360 divided by 6 because there is 6 parts if you shape that as a pizza it would be 6 cuts so you can do 360 divided by 6 and that would equal to 60 or if you do not know how to do the big numbers 36 divided by 6 is 6
do i know how to log into clever 0 jermaine no thank you hold on wait a 2nd sorry i thought i heard something must have been a you are delulu
ooh we might be done almost a little bit early you guys want to do the cha cha slide no no can we do the talking thing we did hold on i got a little bit of mixed of emotions so yes cha cha slide no cha cha slide no no kind of lame kind of lame i am seeing a lot of thumbs up no you are not i think it is mostly thumbs up no you are not can you record our voice please huh can you
it is not satisfying okay my friends we can quietly do this but then we have to make sure hold on when i tell you to line up you got to line up all right so let us quietly watch this we might line up as we are watching okay sh do you think
i do not know how to do it
no worries hold on 12nd so we are not trying to find the line here we already have the line no because we are not reflecting over the middle we are reflecting over this line so that is where your fold should go okay does that make sense yeah okay thank you can i do this can i draw on here
see look it is exactly how it looks right here you need to put these points where it turns up right there does that make sense i guess so this this goes here that goes there that goes there okay how do we feel like we are doing it how are we doing all right what did we try nothing we tried nothing try 1st but though do you like this and this and this
amber jermaine thank you ooh i heard some ooh this is the quietest you all have been that means everyone at your table should be able to share out at least one because you just discussed with each other
pick i love that we can pick if you thought that you were going to say pick as well try to find another word josiah choose choose love 0 i saw some hands go down let us try to think if you can get another one bradley contemplate ooh contemplate i love that we could contemplate in here contemplate brenda select
find easy there we go a lot of great words that mean decide and what we are deciding here is which transformation we are going to use a transformation we learned about transformations and we have specific names for those transformations can we have 3 of them right we know that transformation as a word means what silent hands transformation means to do what damari
yeah that is what i meant thank you so amber is doing her best mine is a little bit smaller than the actual so it is more but yours is small i know all right check your work with amber is does yours look kind of like amber is looks yes
yeah reflect or a reflection 0 no you can not really see it that well reflect or a reflection all right you got 2 left what is another one zion rotation rotation absolutely we have a rotation and the last one the last one honda turn
no did i throw it away right there thank you amber all right amber show us what you did with my big piece of paper and then i want you all to check your answer you want to bring it up with you
how many can we fit
so where do you start would i start it here or here what would you do show me what you did because i lined it up then i did 12 and i
i think that is how most type of absolutely let us start here so decide this is the word that we are doing today deciding what are some other words we can use instead of decide this one was a little tricky for the other classes let us see if we can beat them with a number of words they said steal in the last class do not say steal i do not think steal and decide are basically the same jermaine what is another one pick
360 360 360 so how can we figure out using this right here how many degrees each one of those little pies we could pretend it is a pizza too how much would each slice of this pizza be how could we figure that out not the answer but how would we figure it out brenda 0 you said not the answer so
0 okay yep we are moving on my friend so we are not doing that one that is okay though can i actually call on my friend josiah to show us what he did thanks josiah you are going to use the big one and just as best as you can show us what you did okay okay i like your crocs thank you so who would you switch with chloe
i do not know it is over in the same spot come on everyone you have to start picking up on my patterns all right who would like to come up and show us what they did honda you want to come up and show us what you did awesome come on up friend and you can just show us with the paper you do not have to draw on the board you can just show us what it is that you did never mind 0 never mind he was on the top part of his
0 there is some kind of pattern i like that we are noticing how they are situated with each other absolutely all right let us look a little bit at our wonders now what kind of questions did we have about the triangles here brenda i wonder if you can make a rhombus
yeah they are recording the voices right now when are they going to see it i am scared i want to hear it you want to hear what you sound like i am intrigued you are intrigued yes i want to hear it i do not know i do not know the robot the robot you guys are not going to hear it sorry you guys will never hear it sorry i can just start recording our voices and share it back if you want it will not feel the same 0 wait a 2nd almost all of us are sitting safely can we watch the glass breaking
0 my bad i was asking 0 okay riley ask your partners what number they are who the facilitator thank you
which one which one we talked about it yeah nice okay can i call you that is fine perfect all right all right we are going to bring it back in 3 we are going to bring it back in 2 ooh i see some people with their hands up raise your hand if you have one that you would like to share out all right i am going to call in naim naim what is one that we know reflect
and matthias and keshet who are sitting appropriately both of their feet are on the ground all 4 legs of their chair are on the ground they are facing forward ooh kanye got himself together so did almost zion so did honda thank you josiah for helping out i am waiting on one i am waiting on one to sit down i am waiting on one to sit down all right let us see what time it is you all it is time one 13 0
0 it is still going it is going to break

okay let us do which one absolutely and then damari and then we will come back elect what elect 0 elect okay elect and then find
thank you i heard keshet what is up they are in here next period so i can move on to the next of course yes thank you so much
yes yeah hold on let me put the 3 minute timer we have to do who is next on the back bradley it is bradley next and then can you put my can you put amber in the queue yes in the queue she is in the queue so you said move it right here
ooh it is turn so is it is the last one turning all right let us say we are agreeing the last one at least is turning or is it a different kind of move all right what would turning be if we are describing something as turning what would that be what move would that be zion kind of so translation is our last one but if i said something was turning what type of move would that be what type of move would that be kanye
we are going to reflect it there is the line you are going to fold it make sense all right we are doing number 4 now yeah honey i need you to put that notebook away okay it is not time to draw all right we are reflecting all right i am coming over we are trying our best awesome job hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on wait how do i know when someone needs me raise your hand silent hand
it looks great i am so happy but mine is looks better right no you both have really great triangles on your page so it is a reflection over this line that means this has to be something so like this i just would i wonder because this is you could have i said excuse me before i said excuse me that time at the back
you got the game 0 my god these ones are lame you are talking about how satisfying they are it is not going to make it it is not going to make it do you guys want it to make it down or no yeah i do not want him i do not ever want it to make it down it is not satisfying because at the end it will break but it is not breaking
no ooh i still hear talking and some people are still working brenda can you give her a 2nd what can we do with the paper put them in the garbage
rotating rotating right so turning is more so rotation if we want to talk about translation how would we talk about translation we did a little dance yesterday you could maybe do this bradley cha cha slide
there are a lot of there is what there are a lot of triangles there is a lot of triangles absolutely lots of triangles absolutely lots of triangles let us see some other noticings go jermaine there is 16 rows there is 16 rows yes
i do not know i just have a feeling someone with green pants should pick it up what numbers do you need kanye 0 hold on i still hear voices 16 18 no 6 18 6 and 18 and you still need naim 0 voices are continuing it is 15
all right all right i will get out of the way show us what you did josiah and can you explain to us as you do it like professor josiah would let me make it a little smaller let me make it a little smaller okay try and see if that lines up which one do i find the for it
select great we could definitely select all right 0 i still see some hands up honda you got one guess guess nice we can guess i like that any left let us go josiah 0 i forgot that is okay no do you want me to come back come back i will come back to you all right yeah jermaine which one
where is he do you have them
okay i think 180 okay zion says 180 do we agree do we disagree disagree looks like this like little chirp chirps do we disagree i see some disagree zion can you call on somebody that is disagreeing with you so they can try to convince us or share what they are thinking bradley i disagree with zion because wait what did he say again he said 180
perfect like that all right eyes are on professor josiah what i did was i folded the my paper is not as big as yours so just explain what you did on your paper well i basically did like this and then i lifted up this side and i made the c and the c and then i redrew the whole thing

ooh i like that thank you for adding on bradley so i think we have 2 different answers do you want to add on honda all right i see you doing the building signs so please add on something honda
i am delulu just a little delulu continue my friend brenda you got to be careful with these because if you do not have a zit under there it is going to hurt your face do i have one on my face no you do not have one on your face focus hi anastasia can we to our exit ticket please
turn into something else
on clever yep it is on clever i like that naim has his laptop on his desk and he is facing forward i like that kanye has his laptop on his desk facing forward 0 so does brenda what is it brenda i do not know how to i do not know how to log in
0 a graphing chart without squares what do we call when we graph what is that called more specifically when we have the one with squares bradley the it kind of looks like this a grid okay it is a grid so i am going to use that we are adding on a grid what else do we call it does anyone know that other word for this quadrilateral not quite it is a something plane something plane josiah
you can put them in the garbage or you can keep them brenda is going to collect the tracing paper 0 i am waiting thank you kanye for sitting quietly even though i think you have a pencil that needs to be parked
all right 16 rows i love that 16 rows i am glad that you counted them let us get some other noticings i saw keshet i am going to try to get everyone if i do not get you for this one i can probably get you for the wonder okay we will go keshet i noticed that it looks like it looks like what a graphing chart 0 a graphing chart but with what without the
no no wait why no because i am flipping it what is our fancy word for flipping hold on i need a quiet 0 thank you corbin to reflect
i did not start on it because you said we needed to
but how did you so you said you have the answer could you tell me how you came up with that answer so basically you can get one of the slices and trace it and copy it there and you could turn it and you can measure it i think it is like 60 or 30 or 90 okay so we have a couple of numbers we are throwing out we have 60 you said 60 60
so watch me if we take this remember what we did yesterday let us reflect it over let us reflect it over does that make sense no
yeah so i am also going to label it i would label it too can you all label it like this on here we will just put b we will put c i already did it i already did it i already did it 0 thank you kanye ahead of the game so what we are going to do should i go and translate it like this does a translation look like this no no it absolutely does not right because i am rotating it as i am going should my translation look like this no
so it is going to intersect
i wonder you can keep yourself on that page is this a good right here 0 yeah
14 and 13 i love the communication 14 13 what do you need 10 11
pimples i thought they are meant to be a star no
the orange tag or the middle desk if your partner is nonverbal you can look on the thing and you do it silently and when you get to your computer do what you are supposed to yeah do what you are supposed to do and then when you are done with that i think you can throw away those papers and when you are done with that you sit at your table hands crossed like this and with a bubble
guess okay maybe guess i do not think we are going to have to guess why is it important to select all that apply is there one answer
a coordinate plane a coordinate plane it looks like a grid or a coordinate plane without squares without squares all right i am going to take one more for our noticings one more for our noticings damari i noticed that there is a type of pattern between the triangles
what is going on
and 0 my friends wait a 2nd i am hearing a lot of noise even though i know our directions were to go silently and i think i saw something leave somebody is hand travel through the air and hit somebody else and i would really love if someone wearing green pants that are not uniform would pick it up thank you did you have to say what type of color pants
what is the meaning of the yeah so what is the meaning of what is the meaning of this right what is the meaning all right bradley why is it diagonal ooh why is it diagonal we are definitely going to find that out why is it diagonal let us do the last one damari
0 hold on and i am just saying we can look back you know that it is all recorded remember last year yeah so we can look back so whoever said what we will know all right okay so i love the way that i am seeing let us all turn our attention to jermaine no
wait why am i not translating you are moving 0 sorry i heard a ghost say i heard a ghost say 0 yeah jermaine thank you for raising a quiet hand
