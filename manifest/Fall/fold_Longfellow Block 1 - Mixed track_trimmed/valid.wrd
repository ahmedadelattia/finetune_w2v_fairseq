150 $150 for the computer she earns $14 each hour at her job okay underline the question how many hours did jada need to work to earn the remaining money she needs to buy the computer how many what what is my label hours
okay so it makes it 11 but 111s okay you need to go homework yeah okay so 11 -9 is 2
she does although 14 an hour is not bad i would say it is pretty good all right so what do we need to do divide
okay 5 are there any groups that are still working on theirs no nope
okay we can not do one -6 so we go next door and borrow 10 more 11 -6 50 i already know what i need to put next 4 we already did that so $14 per hour how many hours would she have to work 44 hours she basically needs to work 2 days 0 my god
very good 2 plus the 5 is 7 and the 710s come down for a total of 77 drinks okay so bj which expression did you choose a
8 hey i am hearing a lot of side conversation i need us to do this together and remain focused please so 8 times 3 is 8 times 3 is 24 24 -24 is 0 bring down the 9 9 divided by 3 is 3 3

$383 which makes sense because we said whatever she saved okay that times 3 would give us the cost of the computer so that does make sense okay so she is saved $383 and her parents gave her how much 150
water there are so if i have 4 cases 1234 think about it this way draw the tape diagram use a read write draw tool okay i have 4 cases of water okay and each case has how many bottles hello everyone 20 20 20 20
hours so that is what we are going to have for our answer how many hours so 1st let us examine the question what information do we already know so we already know let us go through each sentence jada is saving for what a computer a computer and how much does that computer cost 1149
5 cans yeah we know she also has juice and she has 5 cans of juice and we want to know how many drinks so we are trying to figure out how much water plus how much what juice juice juice very good so before we could add the water and juice bj what do i need to do figure out how many what bottles of water there are
no 11 yes okay so remember when we do long division you remember do monkeys smell bad d stands for divide divide m multiply s subtract b bring down
$2 so now knowing what we kind of had to do to solve 1st we had to figure out how many total pens then we had to then once we had that information then could we solve it yes okay so would it make sense that they chose b it was 18 divided by whatever 4 +5 was well what is 4 +5 because we always solve what is in parentheses 1st 99
so you can sit here with this group so we had 1234 and one yeah so you guys are doing is not that cool yeah but right now we are going to focus
yes okay we are going to do this together okay so as you see the number on the board as a class you are skip counting it all right so multiples of 8 so we have 88 16 24
okay another keyword if all the pens were to cost the same amount which is very important to know that so we are looking for total and equal groups right yeah okay what is the cost for one pen okay so leo buys 4 blake buys 5 so how many pens do we have
money money does she have but here is another keyword left over how much money does she have left okay so 1st what information do we know okay let me make some space up here money
yeah then she spends $5 right yeah okay so we need to 1st figure out 18 times what times 4 4 and when i say 1st that is when i put those parentheses around it because when i look at my order of operations what is the 1st thing you always do parentheses
in terms of what expression they think matches theirs we are all good yeah
okay so a lot of different things happening right so what strategy do we use to help us cube
losing so i had this but now i am taking away $5 right i am taking away $5 so 72 -5 what is 12 -5 6 6 not 6 what about 7 7
0 and i am giving everyone a minute walking around jayden okay so 9 -3 6 4 -3 one one -5 can not do that can not do it so we need to go next door and borrow 10 more 11 -5 6
how many hours does she need to work in order to earn the remaining money so my label is not money do i need to figure out how much more money she needs in order to figure out how many hours yes yes but the label in the question is asking how many what hours
and then if you have to bring down you must repeat so 11 divided by 3 is how many groups of 3 go into 11 without going over it 3 okay let us skip count by 3s ready 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 would be too many right yeah so how many groups 3
divide all right so her remaining amount is $616 and she makes $14 per hour so however many hours times 14 to give us 616 okay we need to do this before we could go so can 14 go into 6 no what about 61 yes
2 after we subtract we bring down and then repeat 24 divided by 3 what number times 3 gives me 24 8 so if we skip count by 3 everyone 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 21 20 4 how many groups of 3 is that
yeah because 123 groups of 3 3 times 3 is 9 subtract okay how much money has jada saved 383
we have to subtract good so the total cost of the computer is 1149 -533 minus how much money she has go ahead and solve that
2 so how much do you think each pen costs 2
9 because that was the total number of pens okay and $18 is what it costs is that exactly what we did over there yeah
i think the number of kids exactly okay what information do we know okay so we already know that group one has 18 kids okay and then there are 4 groups that each have 5 okay that is all the okay decide together i want you to think what expression would make the most sense
15 30 45 60 60 all right so i know that 1234 groups of 15 is pretty close right so should we try 4 groups of 14 yes all right so 14 times 4 what is 4 times 4 16
so i leave the 6 carry the one 10 over 4 times one 4 4 +one is 5 so 510s so 56 okay do you think we could do one more group of 14 or do you think that is good that is good yeah we would be over right so 4 groups of 14 is 56 okay 61 -56 is 5 5
very good whoopsie whoopsie where was that one supposed there we go okay i did not do the line before whew that was a lot of work huh yes all right turn to the next page
how many kids are at the camp so we are looking for a what total total total we are looking for the total amount of kids 1st so we circled we underlined we boxed now let us examine the question okay we know that our label is how many what kids
999 so our 1st step would be to combine and figure out the total amount of pens so you guys agree that 1st we would have to do 4 +5 to get 9 pens yeah
so we know she needs another $616 that is the amount of money remaining but what is the question asking us how many more hours how many more hours she needs to work in order to earn another $616 so we have one more step she needs $616 and she makes $14 per hour she needs to get a better job
woo that was a lot huh okay i am going to ask you to stay in that seat just because you opted out and i do not want you in the yeah there you go is that okay is she okay yeah can you sit there thank you yeah okay there you go honey you can see okay right you got this all right so we did that with multiples of 8 do you think we could do that with multiples of 9 yeah yeah
44 hours very good all right my friends we will continue picking this up tomorrow so we can
no no no no okay go ahead together read situation 2 and decide how you would solve it and then look at the expressions and decide which expression matches that situation work as a group so did you guys read situation 3 together yes
very good each case has how many bottles 18

so is this group correct thumbs up or thumbs down great job nice job all right okay back table who is my captain for that table please stand read the situation 2 nice and loud
so what do you guys think okay so because you guys are in it so we are focused on this though right now okay so you guys are expression or situation 2 at camp okay one group has 18 kids and 4 groups have 5 kids each how many kids are at the camp so what are we looking for here
72 okay so that is 72 but then if i have $72 okay but then i spend 5 am i gaining $5 or am i losing $5 minus losing
very good so let us 1st cube it so we know that she mows 4 lawns and gets paid $18 per is an operation word per lawn if luna spends $5 spends is also an important keyword here how much money does she have left over what is my label money money if you look at the question we are looking for how much what everyone
absolutely because it is the 18 bottles of 4 cases and we said that 72 plus the 5 cans of juice which gave us 77 drinks all right last one back table who is speaking okay william go ahead
150 okay so we know that she has saved so if the computer costs 3 times as much as what she has saved she has saved 3 times less right which means we are doing what division
all right bj go ahead and read situation 3 out loud 1st go ahead sona buys 4 cases of water each case has 18 bottles if she has 5 cans of juice how many total drinks does she have
luna mows 4 lawns and she gets paid $18 per lawn if luna spends $5 how much money does she have left over
very good so to figure out how much water we could do 4 times 18 because that might be a little faster right yeah all right so what is 18 times 4 everyone what is 4 times 8 32 32 so i leave the 2 carry the 310s 4 times one 4 4 okay +3 7
so you would 1st multiply the 18 times 4 okay so 1st let us think about this so we know our labels are drinks right we are looking for total drinks okay so 1st if we go by sentence sona buys 4 cases of water and each case has 18 bottles so that is information we know right yep
cube we already cube would we already figured out our label we already said the information we have what information do i need in order to solve what is my 1st step going to be so you multiply 4 times 5
good if i am writing you are writing okay so that is the total cost right yeah okay that is 3 times as much money as she has already saved 3 times means what more 3 times means what
540 630 630 720 720 810 810 900 900 man i really slowed it down that time huh yeah
okay 72 so this equals 72 bottles right yes this equals 72 plus the what 55 cans of juice how many drinks do they have total everyone 77 77
okay now 14 is not a number i just skip count in my head naturally right so i am going to think of a number that is close to 14 to skip count by and then use that estimation to help give me an idea of how many groups of 14 to do so skip count by 15 go
circle key numbers and other points u underline the question b box operation clues e explain the question and s solve it step by step
okay at camp a group has 18 kids and 4 groups have 5 kids each how many kids are at the camp so at 1st we did so 1st we did 20 +18 okay so yeah underline 1st one group has 18 kids
divide so we would say we have $18 right divided by the 9 pens okay would give us how much for each pen okay because it said same amount so 18 divided by 9 or what number times 9 would give us 18 2 2
okay and we also know that all the pens were $18 so if i have 9 pens all 9 pens cost $18 how would i figure out how much each pen costs what do we think divide
pemdas okay what does the p stand for parentheses what about the e exponents exponents exponents okay what about the m i am sorry thank you m multiply multiplication what about the d divide then a a for addition and subtraction
16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800
yeah okay nice and loud
there we go 0 technology all right one group has 18 kids we know that we know that 4 groups have 5 kids each they do not have 5 kids all together they have 5 kids each okay so the question says how many what kids what is my label kids
bottles total what not bottles not juice how many total what drinks drinks look at the question how many total drinks so that is water and juice right all right so bj go ahead and tell me how would you solve this bj
yeah if i was to draw a tape diagram okay she mows 4 lawns and makes $18 for each lawn right but then she spends how much 5 5

okay sorry i was going to answer those in all right so at camp we have one group has 18 kids we know that and we know that 4 groups 0 the board turned off what just happened what just happened 0 i am scared
so notice i put the 3 over the 11 3 times 3 is 9 9 subtract can you do one -9 yes yes no no no so what do we need to do everyone it is this many borrow go next door and borrow 10 more right 0 wow wait so it makes it 11
533 okay so 3 +0 is 3 8 +5 is 13 one +3 4 +one 5 so she has $533 okay but the cost of the computer is $1149 so how much is remaining is our next step we have to subtract this is a big one
that she spends $50 that she spends $5 which means she is using that right and then the question says how much money is left okay so william what is the 1st thing i need to do what information do i need to figure out in order to solve this how much money she had in total
7 because we could not do the 2 -5 so we had to go next door and borrow 10 more okay 6 minus nothing 6 so how much money does she have left 67 yeah after she mows the lawn and then spends the 5 she now has $67 left so william what was the correct expression c
so we know that we have 4 cases of water and each case has how many 18 18 yeah 18 bottles per case not as much room to write when we have so many situations up here all right what else do we know we know that she also has what
huh did we say group one was 18 yep yes and we said plus however many were in the other 4 groups yes which if we were to do what is in parentheses 1st we said that would make 20 so 18 +20 which gives us 38 kids would that be correct thumbs up or thumbs down everyone thumbs up nice job all right this group who is the captain bj
45 54 54 63 63 72 81 81 90 90 okay now the multiples of 90 90 180 180 together 270 270 360 360 450 450 540
she earns $14 each hour okay so that is all the information we know from the information they gave us correct yeah
no each case has how many bottles 18 18 thank you so this is water +5 cans of juice 5 cans of juice juice juice in order to figure out how many total drinks i have i could add all those up but what would be faster than adding 184 times bj 4 times 18
multiply good so 4 times 5 is what 20 20 20 20 okay so i know that one group has 18 and the other 4 groups has what 18 18 18 and the other 4 groups have 20 20 kids okay so now can i combine those to find a total amount of kids who were at the camp
yeah okay so 18 +20 is what 38 18 +20 is 38 so how many kids were at the camp 38 38 what kids children 38 kids so joey this group how many or i am sorry what letter did you say what expression does it match d huh d d would that make sense
okay well how much money she made from mowing the 4 lawns is what we 1st need to do that is information we need so we could solve we can not solve until we know how much money she made mowing those lawns so how would i do that 18 times 4
what is in parentheses yeah so 18 times 4 will tell me how much she made okay which is what we just solved that in the last one 77 we just solved this hopefully no what is it 72 72
okay so you guys think b all right before we decide and you give me thumbs up or thumbs down let us cube it together okay so leo buys how many pens 44 pens blake buys 55 pens i see an operation word here what is it total total in all okay the total cost of the pens is how much 18 so all the pens are $18 right yeah
so now we need to figure out how much money she has in total before we need to figure out how many more hours she needs to work so my 2nd step is to do what landon to add 383 +150
okay so we are going to do multiples of 9 and 90 let me slow down the speed okay as you see it on the screen together we are reading each number 9 9 18 9 18 27 27 36 36 45
very good so 1st let us cube it let us use the strategy to cube it okay so what does c stand for circle circle circle everyone what does c stand for circle numbers and labels okay so sona buys 4 cases of water each is a what i box it each is
what information do we know william we know that she mows how many lawns we know she is mowed 4 lawns and got 18 for each lawn she mows and she makes $18 for each lawn right yep good what else do we know landon
