yeah yeah yeah no no no we are going to do the dog one no we did that 0 it is 3 weeks no the sweets one is not the same guy so it is not going to be as fun we are going to do the dog one okay so stand up in your own space hold on torge can you close the door you said my name
you said but they started counting down yeah and that is confusing thank you a bob he keeps saying bob when you were talking and he was just like bob bob bob interesting all right i heard the conversation lull how can we figure this out without just saying it is a right angle how do we know zora
ooh love that we are going to say move so we talked about transformations right it means to change and it means to move but we talked about 3 specific kinds of movement 3 specific kinds of movement turn and talk to your partners figure out what all 3 are what are the 3 types of transformations turn and talk to your partners turn and talk to your partners 0 logan i do not like that i do not like that they have to come and talk to these people right here right you are the group right here
it should it should definitely all right yours looks a little bit like it i thank you no you cannot all right thank you ladies 3 voices are off can i take this off yes please all right so here is what i want us to do we are going to try let me see what time it is what time we got anyone it is 2 9
no my friend we just came from lunch no i have not
yes zora all right my friends please turn do you have a question huh no it is good
all right 2 minutes 2 minutes you should be also collaborating with your group torge she was next in line she is next in line amari you are after her but we might be out of time
i did i wanted to say that if you just drew a line where that it ultimately became a complementary angle
all right i love that i see people turning the page all right we are going to keep it going i am going to do one or we are going to do one together can you hold the question for a moment 0 yeah
rotation beautiful what is our last one that we got i think most people have spoken but i am going to call my friend perry what is the last one perry translation
all right i got to go tristan 1st all right my friends i am going to call in one person and you are going to share with us one you are going to share one all right let us see who we got here let us go eli what is one reflection reflection what is another one logan rotation
i wonder what is this grid used for and why is it being used why is it being used hold on can you say the 1st part for me what is this grid used for what is this i am just going to say what is this for what was the 2nd part why is it used why i am going to say why is it used awesome why is it used kenyatta are there any angles in there
you are test subjects we are the test subjects well really i am the primary focus yeah we are all test subjects it is really how well you guys make me look good remember that is the most important thing no it aint ourselves look good there we go if you make me look good i look good too all right no no only when i make myself look good do you think your actions are making you look good right now no
jayden take a seat we are not talking perfect that is my computer
go check on the thing come what you need amari is supposed to go get it amari go get our laptop hey guys screaming stop being loud not polite number 14 what you need
90 90 degrees 90 degrees how do we know that that is 90 degrees i want you to tell me without saying because it is a right angle how can we figure that out without doing that talk to your partner quick 10 seconds someone next to you how can we figure that out it is more in common
he tells me thank you eli what he just told me to hurry up no or it is the last 10 anyway 0 no it is not sorry i am not mathing correct today you got about 3 sh can you take your headphones off
i am not going to repeat it all right our friend professor logan is going to show us okay so what i did was go diagonally down one to the right and then went up to the right ooh did anyone else do it that way who did it ariani is way all right awesome who did it logan is way nice job i had it a different way
hey my friends what do you need 10 10 16 18 my friends we should be doing this silently we have about 34 minutes log in focus
you got to connect these connect them for me 0 i am hearing talking so i am assuming that we are done so when we are done i want you to put a peace sign over your eye like this if you notice i popped a little hip done with all 4 no just done with number 2
well i know if i have a square all squares do the same thing and i can just draw a square in each corner of the 360 ooh draw a square until we go to 360 but how does that help us because if you know you got this you got it
i get the ticket and then i will answer here what are these okay do this 1st do that 1st please and then i will talk to you about i will inspect these and then come back to you you are just carrying our pieces to a card game no
huh it is not should i do it again wait never mind i got it it is kind of like what i will do it one more time why do you move it over the amount of times you move it that is a good question can i answer it yeah you could answer it you move it to the right 6 times so that the a will line up with the a in the figure and so you just move it up so this is what you are doing and then you got to add up just move it up
are there any angles are there any angles here perhaps perhaps we might see some paige why is it called an isometric grid
one more minute so i should see things being traced being translated i did i am done
torge likes to just using the sticky note method and i said a right angle is half of a straight angle so that would be a way to measure it ooh i love that the sticky note method awesome okay collaboration over here with this group we love that all right we have another one to add on yeah i said that it is a 90 degree angle if when you draw that little square right there makes a full complete square there we go okay love that okay did you want to add on kenyatta
0 okay so how about we not let us pause there because see i do not like that i had to pause because i really love what torge just said okay we are not going to throw things okay and we are not going to rip up things okay sound good deal deal deal because if you are ripping up that paper you need it later i needed it of course you need it more all right so i really love what torge said does anyone else have something they want to add on paige
absolutely 0 you want to add okay i will take one more zora the triangles are rotated and reflected to make different patterns and shapes
i think that is a ooh we might see some ooh okay vocabulary we might see some vertical angles here absolutely let us see this angle which one is this vertical angle tell me where my hand should go yeah it is a vertical angle across across right here yes
i can not let you go because it is a
well 1st you go this way this way 0 you are going through the grid you can do what you did okay 123 all right did can i do it did anyone do it a different way i did it a different way i did it a different way 0 thank you ariani professor logan is going to show zora i saw that what it was my
you do not need to write anything right we are actually performing the translation where did you steal that from it is from me i bought it 0 really i bought it with my money with my grown up money i am getting $5 tomorrow so let us $5 hold on 12nd friend i got to see what we got here
you already know shut up sh kind words all right thank you she has been doing that all day sh 0 we are looking at professor veronica 0 it actually works all right show us what you did okay so 1st i just did this 0 what could we do so that if you were telling somebody if you were telling somebody this is how you needed to translate it what could you tell us i went diagonally up
i am still younger than your mother i told my mom is younger than you period scorpio i am hoping that i could not be any of your mothers all right again peace sign of your eyes thank you zora thank you paige thank you i love thank you jett thank you i was doing it but i have to pick my i know that is all right all right check your work with your partners check your work with your partners i can not draw see
you just got to try your best veronica will you come on the board and show us with this one just how you moved it just wait a 2nd i am going to let veronica do it i mean i appreciate you it looks like you want to 0 wait can i do it
that is fine you still have some time you have some time amari come back amari thank you you do not need your backpack for the bathroom
to place it somewhere else to place it somewhere else how could we describe it what type of move does that what kind of movement is it yeah you have to move it without rotating it moving it without rotating it absolutely yeah paige wait does say translation
not for right now i like having you in the front yeah transformation rotation yeah it is okay
hold on peel your eyes where would i put my phone who guessed right there i stole it i saw it 1st voices off 32 voices off 21 2 32 0
here you go i am going to call on you because it looks like you are on something else than us so i am going to call on you just so you know so i would maybe collaborate with your friends around there so you know what we are talking about we already talked you already talked yes so he is ready no he should be ready all right he should be
okay cha cha slide or would you rather cha cha slide would you rather i need to see everyone is fingers because we are voting that is fine that is equitable all right i am sorry i will try to find a would you rather we have not done yet they make them all the time that guy does it all the time
because it is less than an acute angle no it is more than an acute angle but less than an obtuse angle ooh okay it is more than an acute angle but less than and also also also 0 okay you could make a box in the corner ooh okay we could make a box and then we would know anyone else have a different method torge

yeah absolutely we could do 360 divided by 6 and what do we get when we divide it by 60 hold on share with your partner quick 10 seconds and then we are going to share it out on the count of 3 okay ready 123 60

torge it is not that serious all right ready did we do the dog one no they just posted that 5 hours ago 0 then we have not done it jose they posted this 15 hours ago i was 5 hours ago on youtube i saw that no you 0 that is would you rather i do not know that one
do not do it again i saw it and i will write it down in the dean is list and i will call a parent just like i am going to do for the people that push each other in the hallway we are not putting hands on each other because if she actually would have fell zora and hit her head on these desks it is not worth it what was i talking about
no if you are you should get to class on time so you can be a 0 remain silent we have friends who are still working zora jayden i see the both of you torge yes silent
2 interesting interesting i mean you move the 10 so you go over 2 up one over which way to the left to the right 0 okay beautiful so yours is going to look kind of like this does yours look like this show me yes show me no it should
where is your tracing paper yeah right there use the tracing paper that will help hold on 12nd what is up i can not send you to the cafeteria it is in rotation too it is telling us what it is a rotation you are not writing you are doing exactly what we just did
wonders or notice notice let us do a notice i noticed that there was a lot of triangles lots of triangles some might even say too many triangles i do not know depending on what shape you like logan i noticed that the triangles keep making a pattern over and over and over and over and over and over and
all right i am going to call on my friend diego and i am going to call on logan afterwards in case logan has something to add on diego how could we figure out what each of these angles measure as you could divide 360 by 60 why could we do that because there is 6 different angles and all of them they are all the same
i have 2 questions okay hold on i will be there let me put a timer on and then i will come and answer your questions hold on 12nd check your work yours kind of rotated a little see how this is still slanted and this is now in line you rotated it a little too much i do not understand i do not know how to draw
i do not know he just returned the spanish version he was not participating so yeah no do you want them no i am good thank you diego thank you perry i just i just
no because we were watching in the last class and then when you are done clean up and then return to your seat silently ooh sh silent which of these triangles are translations you will tell us
all right thank you okay my friends 3 voices off 21 it is exit ticket time listen closely already it is right math is so fun today that time just went by so fast it was not it was not

25 jayden no it is the last 10 what you need jayden what you need what number do you need okay go sit down jayden is going to bring you look over the instructions
yes the would you rathers okay we will do that can we do the cha cha slide do you guys want to do the cha cha slide okay okay okay we are doing a vote we are doing a vote voices off 30 hold on i still see computers out though so your option is cha cha slide put up a one for cha cha slide you know the cha cha slide jose yes
if your mom did not bring tylenol or anything here so the nurse can do nothing for your headache if you want to put your head down that is fine i can not send you to the nurse i will text your mother and let her know that you have a headache and that it was a little hard for you to do work today because of it but i will also say hey jayden does not want to eat the school lunch and he got a headache because he did not so then maybe she can send you with a lunch tomorrow okay
and over yeah okay lots of triangles making a pattern making a pattern all right let me take one more it is going to be thank you jayden i noticed that there is lines in the zigzags that make the triangles yeah so lines and zigzags zigzags lines can i add something
so yes so for example if i were to describe to you all what to do in words i would say translate the points 6 to the right into up all right i would say just move it that does not give us enough information so what we want to do is count 1234561212
so because i know that is 90 degrees so ooh 0 hold on 12nd okay go pick it up he keeps handing that to me and
all right 0 i have someone who wants to add on okay thank you professor can i come up yes come on up 0 my god she is my assistant no teacher is assistant 0 excuse me move please excuse me all right so professor zora is narrating now all right you go 112
ooh why is it called an isometric grid i am just going to put isometric isometric all right mikayla are you raising your hand 0 i could not tell if you were doing a signal because you had very prominent a 2 like you are hailing a taxi in new york all right go on what is yours mikayla why is there triangles instead of squares
just use this one for now what else do you need yeah we get out at 2 330 2 330 just kidding you have time but still it is too loud we need to get it is my 10 i know someone else has yours
you okay you okay are you tired no no no wake up what do you need
we can use grids to carry out transformation beautiful we used today or we learned a little bit about our isometric grid and our regular coordinate plane all right so we are going to keep it moving i know some of you all already got started on the other work that we had let us see what we got here i am sorry
thank you paige and jose who have continued to remain silent the whole time as well as kenyatta kenyatta sorry it is just a natural instinct for me to do that
i can decide what kind of transformations will work to move one figure to another one beautiful hold on this word transformation what does to transform something mean we talked about this we are talking about transformations jose to change into to change into to change does someone else have one more thing they might want to add onto this anything else zora to move a figure
it is okay we have time i am putting up on the board r let me not do this so you guys can not see ooh
that is amari so let us take a little bit of a closer look at what we have here right now all right we will try to answer these 2 questions at least all right the isometric i am going to be honest i need to look up what that word actually means so we are going to pause you know what i mean no but i was thinking maybe it has to do with isosceles triangles like the
just flip it over 0 what is it telling us to do what move to translate to translate them so that a lines up with c try it yourself i am putting 2 minutes on talk to your group say how could we actually do this i do not know trace it use the tracing paper you all
you pop a hip you are going to break a hip how old do you think i am i heard you are like 29 exactly if you was born in the 90s you are 80 in my book you is 81 foot in the grave i am younger than your mother my mom is 331st of all so i am younger than your mother no no she is 32 times
