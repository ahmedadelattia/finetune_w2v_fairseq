kids circle kids okay so we are trying to figure out how many kids so i already know that one group has 18 right +4 groups have 5 kids each so is there something we could draw to help us understand we could do multiplication
sh all right what is 3 +0 3 3 3 what is 8 +5 13 carry the one what is one +3 4 +one 5 so we know that she has 583 or $533 how much does the computer cost though 1149
leo buys 4 pens blake buys 5 pens the total cost of the pens is $18 if all the pens cost the same amount what is the cost for one pen okay so 1st let us cube it so leo has how many pens 4 blake has how many pens 55 the total that is a what operation word operation word
nice job you guys did an excellent job doing that now i want to see if you could do it with multiples of 9 ooh it is kind of hard but again we are not going ahead of the group i am slowing that speed down so we could read it together so do not say it until it is on the screen multiples of 9 9 18 18 pause 27 36
80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800
division division so if i wanted to figure out how much she has saved i would not multiply the cost of the computer by 3 i would actually divide it by 3 right okay what else do we know what comes next we know that her parents gave her $150 150 for the computer as well
19 divided by not 19 ah 18 by 9
what about 61 yeah yeah okay i do not know off the top of my head how to count by 14 but i do know it is easy to count by 15s and that could give me an idea of how many groups of 14 to try so let us go ahead and skip count by 15 ready go 15 30 45 60 15 30 45 60 is that pretty close that is really close yeah
so now you do 616 plus
well before we divide what do i need to do 1st so let us think what information do we know we know that leo buys 4 and blake buys 5 pens and we know that they spent $18 we divide by 18 before we could divide 1st i need to figure out how many what the total pens i have the total pens i have so what do i do to figure that out that is 4 +4 +5 5
he does not have his book okay just share with lucas then okay because we are in the middle of a recording and a lesson go sit down all right 0 it looks like someone found it for you what do you say okay you can go back to your table now all right so let us go through sana buys how many cases of water 4 bottles 4 cases
i keep saying it is d but she will not agree hold on well let us talk it through now underline now box the word each hey how many kids are at the camp underline the question what is my label how many what kids kids
77
yeah so i know that i have 4 pens +5 pens which gives me how many total pens 99 pens and i know all 9 pens cost how much 18 18 $18 if i have $18 for 9 pens okay how much does it cost for each pen what would i need to do zach divide 9 divide what do i divide
not plus so 533 plus the 616 will buy that but this is how much money she still needs but we want to know how many hours she has to work so every hour is $14 so think about it that way if i have $616 we are taking groups of 14 away to figure out how many hours that is if i am taking equal groups away i am doing what operation division
yeah if you add the inside of the tape diagram that will give you your total so i know one group is 18 plus what do i notice about the rest of the groups they all have the same number number so i could add 54 times or what would be faster zach huh what would be faster than adding 5 +5 +5 +5 times 4
12 would be too many so how many groups of 3 3 so above 11 i am going to write 3 and i know that we are all following along and filling this out as i go yes yeah so let us make sure we are writing it okay so we divided what is 3 times 3 9 what is 11 -9 2 2
multiplication and division division very good so we have 4 main operations okay that we are going to focus on before we do that our warm up is going to be skip counting by 8s multiples of 8 and then multiples of 80 but if you could skip count by 8 you could skip count by 80 because instead of skip counting by 8 ones you are doing 8 10s which means there is just a 0 at the end
5 cans of juice what do we know about tape diagrams what do we know about tape diagrams emma that you can just add on the numbers that are in the squares because those are
what does m stand for multiply subtract bring down very good so can we do one divided by 3 no no no can we do 11 divided by 3 yes okay how many groups of 3 go into 11 without going over so 3 let us skip count ready 3 3 6 9 12
$18 so $18 plus $18 plus $18 plus $18 do we know how much money she made no yeah no how do we figure that out 18 times 4 i could add 184 times or what you can do 18 times 4 18 times 4 so 30
44 hours not dollars hours that was a tough problem you guys all right when you are done filling that out we are a little over so i need you to put your pencils in the caddy books back on the shelf take
good we can not do one -9 so we need to take 10 more so now we have 11 ones -9 ones which is 2 2 2 bring down the 4 what is 24 divided by 3 8 8 let us see 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 9 12 15 18 21 24 good okay so how many groups 8
all right so 1st let us cube it so at camp one group has 18 kids if i am cubing you are cubing okay and 4 groups have 5 kids each important word there how many kids are at the camp what is my label going to be kids kids at the camp
i got it 169 you got it okay all right so we are on this one here because i know you guys are joining us again all right so what is our label going to be drinks drinks okay what information do we already know so let us go through the question what do we already know
no no
yes very bad okay how much money does she have left over what is my label going to be how much what money
juice yeah so we have water and juice right underline the question how many total drinks does she have okay how many total is an operation word okay and what will our label be let us look at the question how many total what how many total what everyone
okay so now i know that she still needs right her remaining what she still needs is $616 but what is the question asking me how many hours she has to work so we have one more step 0 wait
yeah we said $72 but then spent 5 how much money did she have left over 67 bucks 67
yeah she is saving for a computer and how much does the computer cost 1149
you have 18 +4 times 7 kids yeah so i know i have 4 +5 right leo has 4 and blake has 5 okay so that would give me 9 okay so if i have but they all cost $18 how would i figure out how much each one costs by 9 yeah but you still have to do all of this yeah so and these which of these expressions would make sense yep i told you
i had your books on your desk did you take them when you went back to ms kramer no ms kramer took ours
this is mine okay put it away i do not know why you have it
made okay so let us do another drawing let us do this we could do okay 4 lawns each lawn she made 0 $18 18
drinks
yeah if you add up the inside that will tell you your total right so i could do 18 +18 +18 +18 +5 okay or if i am adding the same number over and over what is another operation i could use isaac multiplication
hour hour at her job okay underline the question how many hours does jada need to work to earn the remaining money she needs to buy the computer how many what money how many what what is my label dollars dollars read the question hours how many hours so again i am going to ask what is our label hours hours how many hours
no because it would be too many that is right so can we do one -6 no go next door 11 -6 5 bring down my next number 0 my goodness i do not even have to do anything because i already know 4 groups of 14 is 56 560 my god 0 my goodness gracious
27 36 pause 45 54 63 72 81 90 45 54 63 72 81 90 now multiples of 90 90 180 270 360 450 540 630 720 810 900
good divide by 9 but before we knew that was 9 it was 4 +5 right then we figured out it was 9 all right so this is in parentheses why because we solve what is in parentheses 1st i want you to think about order of operations which we have talked about who remembers what this stands for latrell
okay yuna mows 4 lawns and gets paid $18 per lawn if yuna spends $5 how much money does she have left over okay 18 times 4 -5 okay you need to cube you are not going to cube okay so let us cube it leo buys 4 pens circle 4 pens no no we are doing number 3
8 so 8 times 3 is 8 times 3 is 24 24 subtract 24 -24 is 0 bring down your 4 okay bring down the 9 9 divided by 3 3 3123 groups 3 times 3 is is 9 9 is there anything left to bring down no no
okay so we are going to go ahead and cube it so 1st we need to circle those numbers and labels we need to underline the question we need to box those operation words and then we need to examine everything before we decide how to solve it okay so ariel do you have a question we all did have our books out because
divide very good so our 1st step we are going to divide 1149 by 3 so because we are running short on time let us go ahead and solve this together so how do we do long division do monkeys smell bad monkeys smell bad what does d stand for divide
okay so in order to figure out how many hours she needs to work i need to know how much money she still needs to make to buy that computer so how would i do that subtraction okay what would i subtract 1149 minus okay bentley the total of the computer and the number of
no you add up everything in the tape and that gives you your total right so we already know this is 18 plus instead of adding 54 times what could you do so which of these expressions would match that okay so if she had 18 per lawn and then she spends
that is right so i am going to put that in parentheses 4 times 5 or 5 times 4 because i need to figure that out 1st before i could add it to the 18 okay so isaac which expression did your group decide d there is like one minute till recess thumbs up or thumbs down thumbs up in our group
jada is saving money for a computer that costs $1149 that is 3 times as much money as she has already saved her parents also gave her $150 for the computer jada earns $14 each hour at her job how many hours does jada need to work to earn the remaining money she needs to buy the computer
multiplication so i am going to put that in parentheses because what is the 1st step before i could combine and figure out my total amount of drinks i 1st need to figure out how many bottles of water i have do i know how many bottles i have yet no no i know that i have 4 cases and each case has 18 bottles but i do not know how many bottles of water yet how much water plus what how much how many cans
box operation clues e examine the question examine the question examine the question so yuna mows how many lawns 4 lawns
anna buys 4 cases of water each case has 18 bottles if she also has 5 cans of juice how many total drinks does she have
no so she saved how much money she saved $383 yeah which makes sense because 383 okay times 3 gives me the cost of that computer okay now we know that she saved $383 we know that her parents gave her how much 150
no so should we solve that 1st yes okay so we said if we do not know one of the factors okay whatever she saved times 3 would give us the cost of the computer how would we figure out the other factor we would divide
4 lawns if i am writing you are writing in your book so let us keep it together yuna has 4 lawns and gets paid $18 per lawn per is another word for each right if yuna spends $5 ooh spends if i spend money am i losing money or gaining money you are losing it losing losing money is bad
the parentheses which makes sense because before we could do $18 divided by the total amount of pens we 1st had to figure out how many total pens we had okay and if i was to solve this this would mean that each pen costs 2 $2 so zach what expression did you guys choose a b c or d b
i know what one stands for okay please excuse my dear aunt sally say it please excuse my dear aunt sally okay p stands for parentheses e stands for power power evaluate okay exponents evaluate no exponents e stands for what multiplication exponents okay then m multiplication
1149
so i know how much money is remaining i know that she makes $14 per hour how would i figure out how many more hours she needs to work in order to make up the remaining $616 okay i have been seeing the same 3 hands anyone else want to help let us see emma great thank you
okay hold on 1st we do what is in parentheses right so 4 times 8 32 carry the 3 10s 4 times one 4 +3 7 so 7 10s so 72 +5 now right because we solved what is in parentheses how many total drinks does she have
so we could do a tape diagram right so let us see if we were to draw a tape diagram okay so i know one group is 18 right one group is 18 and then i know that 4 groups have 5 kids each and what do we know about tape diagrams it is like area
thumbs up or thumbs down friends great make sure that you have this in your book as well let us try to do one more group okay group 2 isaac go ahead and read isaac okay at a camp one group has 18 kids and 4 groups have 5 kids each how many kids are at the camp
end very good all right so we are not going ahead of the group you are not saying it until you see it on the screen so as soon as you see the number on the screen as a class you are saying the number so we are 1st going to start with multiples of 8 and then go right into multiples of 80 8 8 16 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
go ahead and add she saved 383 and then her parents gave her 150 so in order to figure out the amount of money remaining in order to figure out how many hours she needs to work we need to figure out how much money she has sorry just give me a couple of minutes okay just wait quietly now
all right so we are going to use the read write draw so read it okay when we are reading it we want to cube it we are going to write what we know we are going to draw what we know and then we are going to figure it out so let us go ahead and start with cubes okay so jada is saving money for a what what are we saving for computer computer computer
how many so 5 cans of juice to give me my total so group 3 bentley which expression did you say was the best fit a a would that make sense yes okay so 18 times 4 okay is what 72 72 but then you add the 5
money okay and then left over left means what is remaining what is left after so she makes this money mowing lawn and then she spends 5 but before we could figure that out do we know how much money she made mowing the lawn no no no so what do we need to do 1st we need to figure out how much money she made earned earned
yuna mows 4 lawns and gets paid $18 per lawn if yuna spends $5 how much does she have left over all right so 1st we need to cube it cube it see circle the important numbers and labels u everyone underline the question underline the question b box operation clues
thank you to those who are following directions okay so number 2 would someone like to read this out loud okay izzy
hey $67 very good all right so those were a little bit of a warm up because our next one is a little bit more challenging so we are going to take it a step further go ahead and turn to the next page
4 cases of water okay so let us draw a tape diagram how many cases of water do we have 4 cases of water 44 and how many bottles are in each case 18
okay d division a addition s subtraction okay and then we learned last week that it is really important that we follow that order when we are solving because if we do not follow that order that we could get different answers okay so we know that the 1st thing we always need to do is what is in the parentheses
one one what is one -5 you can not do that you can not do that so i can not take 5 cookies away from someone who only has one cookie so we have to go next door and borrow what is 11 -5 6
5 cans of juice 5 cans of water
division so last step $616 divided by the $14 she makes per hour okay that is a lot of work so it is a lot of work i know multi step work but you know what you could do it that is what we learned today it is a lot of work a lot of thinking a lot of organizing but you could do it okay so can 14 go into 6 no
okay how many groups of 15 is that 4 should we try 4 groups of 14 yes okay so if we did 4 groups of 14 that would be what 56 what is 4 times 4 16 carry the one carry the one what is 4 times one 4 +one 5 would 56 work yeah can i do another group of 14 no
okay so what i am going to have you do ariel is if you could grab your group is books for me and bring them in here i would appreciate it and just let ms kramer know you are going finish it with me then okay all right so let us go ahead and cube it so sana buys how many cases of water 4
kids okay now aside from going through cubing it and coming up with operations is there something i could draw also to help me yes yes what can i draw isaac a tape diagram a tape diagram so if i was to draw a tape diagram okay i know that one group has how many kids 18 18 and i know that 4 groups have 5 kids
the total cost of the pens is $18 if all the pens cost the same amount okay underline the question what is the cost for one pen so we are looking for the cost how much it costs for what for one pen for one pen
yeah okay let me see okay so i hear some people are disagreeing we are not going to just throw out a letter okay so you guys need to cube it 1st leo buys 4 pens circle 4 pens circle 4 pens right here we are cubing it circle 4 pens and the label 4 pens okay blake buys how many pens okay 5
$150 okay add them up so we need to add them up that is right so how much money does she have is our next step that is 530
okay so even if you did not do situation one you should be cubing situation one on your paper okay you are following along okay now zach i know that all the pens cost the same amount and i know that i need to figure out what each pen costs but how do i do that it is divide
have 5 kids each have 5 kids each which means i have 5 groups right one group has 184 groups have 5 kids each okay do we know how many total kids are at the camp no no no but is that something we need to figure out yeah yes okay what do we know about tape diagrams isaac you add all the numbers up to get the inside
5 xavier he do not have his book
she spent $5 so am i losing $5 or gaining $5 losing losing the $5 i am losing $5 which means i am what subtracting subtracting subtracting $5 so we said that 18 times 4 she had $72 now minus the 5 right which makes sense for which expression latrell d c i said d
okay so if she makes $14 an hour how many hours is she working to make up the rest of that money 44
0 is that it i told you so if you guys disagree that is okay but you need to explain why you disagree so you can come to a conclusion okay all right 55
what is 18 times 4 we just did that 72 72 yeah 72 we just solved that so we know she made $72 okay so 1st we said $18 per lawn and she did 4 lawns right i put that in parentheses so that was my 1st step but then she did what she spent $5
24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 good now by 80s 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800
one case of water 18 18 18 18 so here are my 4 cases of water okay but we want to know how many total drinks what in addition to those 4 cases of water does she also have 5 cases of juice
