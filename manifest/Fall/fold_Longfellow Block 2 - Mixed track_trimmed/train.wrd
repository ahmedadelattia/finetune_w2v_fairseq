180 i disagree because 180 is a straight line 0 that is why yeah and you are doing that so it is a 90 degree angle all right do we agree with that so what bradley is saying 0 i think we agree and i think zion was like 0 yeah and i heard him say also that it was 90 you have another thought yeah what is your thought i feel as if you knew it was going to be a 90 degree angle you should have went like this because as this it is the one that l shape
see it overlapped so whatever that is okay that is absolutely it so ready what you want to do here is match up this with this okay so this is not really connected to this one yet so what we are going to do all right we are going to take this we want to make sure c matches up here so we are going to go 121 okay does that make sense so the cs need to match up with each other
awesome actually amber you do not need to mark it down you can just hold it like that all right thank you all right show me if yours looks like amber is looks show i agree beautiful all right let us try another one thank you i think we are getting the hang of it mine is looks exactly just like that
4 what numbers do you need 100 you did not ask you are not ready what numbers do you need i need one 8 and i need 19 one 8 you need hold on 4 hold on 7 and 16 only 14 and 13
it is on volume but it is not breaking up yeah it is pick another one i think we have to hear it right otherwise it does not really it is not satisfying

ooh can you make a rhombus i love that shape can you make a rhombus that is a good question we might be able to answer that any other questions we have josiah what are they for ooh what is this even for what do we use this for what is this even for any other wonders amber and then i will go to bradley
i could move where it is
yeah 90 degrees yeah but it is like a 90 degree angle is like this is a 90 degree angle like this no i said like this closed yours is straight it looks like that one vertical angle no not
okay you added the hands crossed and the bubble but that is fine we are sitting silently where should the computers go when you are done with your exit ticket jermaine the blue desk the blue desk beautiful all right all right my friends so we are going to do that now orange tagged people come on over and i will help you make sure you are communicating what computer do you need i am number one please and ask a friend ask corbin what one go ask corbin and zion which numbers they need
the glass breaking you want to watch a glass breaking video no way yeah okay hold on we will do one glass breaking video do you want to do that yeah we want to watch a glass breaking video yes yes okay we got to be quiet which one top or bottom tiktok tiktok tiktok okay okay sh we got to be quiet i follow him on tiktok hold on i am sorry i am sorry it is on volume
yeah you can mark it down too let me give you a marker all right check your work with amber damari kanye no thank you we do not need to touch each other so please stop all right we are watching amber move it 0 amber i think mine is too big up there so just do your best it is too small
all right so brenda says we can cut them out and we can measure them there so she says 60 degrees is her answer 0 you want to build on yeah all right build on a easier way to do it is 360 divided by 6 because there is 6 parts if you shape that as a pizza it would be 6 cuts so you can do 360 divided by 6 and that would equal to 60 or if you do not know how to do the big numbers 36 divided by 6 is 6
do i know how to log into clever 0 jermaine no thank you hold on wait a 2nd sorry i thought i heard something must have been a you are delulu
ooh we might be done almost a little bit early you guys want to do the cha cha slide no no can we do the talking thing we did hold on i got a little bit of mixed of emotions so yes cha cha slide no cha cha slide no no kind of lame kind of lame i am seeing a lot of thumbs up no you are not i think it is mostly thumbs up no you are not can you record our voice please huh can you
it is not satisfying okay my friends we can quietly do this but then we have to make sure hold on when i tell you to line up you got to line up all right so let us quietly watch this we might line up as we are watching okay sh do you think
i do not know how to do it
no worries hold on 12nd so we are not trying to find the line here we already have the line no because we are not reflecting over the middle we are reflecting over this line so that is where your fold should go okay does that make sense yeah okay thank you can i do this can i draw on here
see look it is exactly how it looks right here you need to put these points where it turns up right there does that make sense i guess so this this goes here that goes there that goes there okay how do we feel like we are doing it how are we doing all right what did we try nothing we tried nothing try 1st but though do you like this and this and this
amber jermaine thank you ooh i heard some ooh this is the quietest you all have been that means everyone at your table should be able to share out at least one because you just discussed with each other
pick i love that we can pick if you thought that you were going to say pick as well try to find another word josiah choose choose love 0 i saw some hands go down let us try to think if you can get another one bradley contemplate ooh contemplate i love that we could contemplate in here contemplate brenda select
find easy there we go a lot of great words that mean decide and what we are deciding here is which transformation we are going to use a transformation we learned about transformations and we have specific names for those transformations can we have 3 of them right we know that transformation as a word means what silent hands transformation means to do what damari
yeah that is what i meant thank you so amber is doing her best mine is a little bit smaller than the actual so it is more but yours is small i know all right check your work with amber is does yours look kind of like amber is looks yes
yeah reflect or a reflection 0 no you can not really see it that well reflect or a reflection all right you got 2 left what is another one zion rotation rotation absolutely we have a rotation and the last one the last one honda turn
no did i throw it away right there thank you amber all right amber show us what you did with my big piece of paper and then i want you all to check your answer you want to bring it up with you
how many can we fit
so where do you start would i start it here or here what would you do show me what you did because i lined it up then i did 12 and i
i think that is how most type of absolutely let us start here so decide this is the word that we are doing today deciding what are some other words we can use instead of decide this one was a little tricky for the other classes let us see if we can beat them with a number of words they said steal in the last class do not say steal i do not think steal and decide are basically the same jermaine what is another one pick
360 360 360 so how can we figure out using this right here how many degrees each one of those little pies we could pretend it is a pizza too how much would each slice of this pizza be how could we figure that out not the answer but how would we figure it out brenda 0 you said not the answer so
0 okay yep we are moving on my friend so we are not doing that one that is okay though can i actually call on my friend josiah to show us what he did thanks josiah you are going to use the big one and just as best as you can show us what you did okay okay i like your crocs thank you so who would you switch with chloe
i do not know it is over in the same spot come on everyone you have to start picking up on my patterns all right who would like to come up and show us what they did honda you want to come up and show us what you did awesome come on up friend and you can just show us with the paper you do not have to draw on the board you can just show us what it is that you did never mind 0 never mind he was on the top part of his
0 there is some kind of pattern i like that we are noticing how they are situated with each other absolutely all right let us look a little bit at our wonders now what kind of questions did we have about the triangles here brenda i wonder if you can make a rhombus
yeah they are recording the voices right now when are they going to see it i am scared i want to hear it you want to hear what you sound like i am intrigued you are intrigued yes i want to hear it i do not know i do not know the robot the robot you guys are not going to hear it sorry you guys will never hear it sorry i can just start recording our voices and share it back if you want it will not feel the same 0 wait a 2nd almost all of us are sitting safely can we watch the glass breaking
0 my bad i was asking 0 okay riley ask your partners what number they are who the facilitator thank you
which one which one we talked about it yeah nice okay can i call you that is fine perfect all right all right we are going to bring it back in 3 we are going to bring it back in 2 ooh i see some people with their hands up raise your hand if you have one that you would like to share out all right i am going to call in naim naim what is one that we know reflect
and matthias and keshet who are sitting appropriately both of their feet are on the ground all 4 legs of their chair are on the ground they are facing forward ooh kanye got himself together so did almost zion so did honda thank you josiah for helping out i am waiting on one i am waiting on one to sit down i am waiting on one to sit down all right let us see what time it is you all it is time one 13 0
0 it is still going it is going to break

okay let us do which one absolutely and then damari and then we will come back elect what elect 0 elect okay elect and then find
thank you i heard keshet what is up they are in here next period so i can move on to the next of course yes thank you so much
yes yeah hold on let me put the 3 minute timer we have to do who is next on the back bradley it is bradley next and then can you put my can you put amber in the queue yes in the queue she is in the queue so you said move it right here
ooh it is turn so is it is the last one turning all right let us say we are agreeing the last one at least is turning or is it a different kind of move all right what would turning be if we are describing something as turning what would that be what move would that be zion kind of so translation is our last one but if i said something was turning what type of move would that be what type of move would that be kanye
we are going to reflect it there is the line you are going to fold it make sense all right we are doing number 4 now yeah honey i need you to put that notebook away okay it is not time to draw all right we are reflecting all right i am coming over we are trying our best awesome job hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on wait how do i know when someone needs me raise your hand silent hand
it looks great i am so happy but mine is looks better right no you both have really great triangles on your page so it is a reflection over this line that means this has to be something so like this i just would i wonder because this is you could have i said excuse me before i said excuse me that time at the back
you got the game 0 my god these ones are lame you are talking about how satisfying they are it is not going to make it it is not going to make it do you guys want it to make it down or no yeah i do not want him i do not ever want it to make it down it is not satisfying because at the end it will break but it is not breaking
no ooh i still hear talking and some people are still working brenda can you give her a 2nd what can we do with the paper put them in the garbage
rotating rotating right so turning is more so rotation if we want to talk about translation how would we talk about translation we did a little dance yesterday you could maybe do this bradley cha cha slide
there are a lot of there is what there are a lot of triangles there is a lot of triangles absolutely lots of triangles absolutely lots of triangles let us see some other noticings go jermaine there is 16 rows there is 16 rows yes
i do not know i just have a feeling someone with green pants should pick it up what numbers do you need kanye 0 hold on i still hear voices 16 18 no 6 18 6 and 18 and you still need naim 0 voices are continuing it is 15
all right all right i will get out of the way show us what you did josiah and can you explain to us as you do it like professor josiah would let me make it a little smaller let me make it a little smaller okay try and see if that lines up which one do i find the for it
select great we could definitely select all right 0 i still see some hands up honda you got one guess guess nice we can guess i like that any left let us go josiah 0 i forgot that is okay no do you want me to come back come back i will come back to you all right yeah jermaine which one
where is he do you have them
okay i think 180 okay zion says 180 do we agree do we disagree disagree looks like this like little chirp chirps do we disagree i see some disagree zion can you call on somebody that is disagreeing with you so they can try to convince us or share what they are thinking bradley i disagree with zion because wait what did he say again he said 180
perfect like that all right eyes are on professor josiah what i did was i folded the my paper is not as big as yours so just explain what you did on your paper well i basically did like this and then i lifted up this side and i made the c and the c and then i redrew the whole thing

ooh i like that thank you for adding on bradley so i think we have 2 different answers do you want to add on honda all right i see you doing the building signs so please add on something honda
i am delulu just a little delulu continue my friend brenda you got to be careful with these because if you do not have a zit under there it is going to hurt your face do i have one on my face no you do not have one on your face focus hi anastasia can we to our exit ticket please
turn into something else
on clever yep it is on clever i like that naim has his laptop on his desk and he is facing forward i like that kanye has his laptop on his desk facing forward 0 so does brenda what is it brenda i do not know how to i do not know how to log in
0 a graphing chart without squares what do we call when we graph what is that called more specifically when we have the one with squares bradley the it kind of looks like this a grid okay it is a grid so i am going to use that we are adding on a grid what else do we call it does anyone know that other word for this quadrilateral not quite it is a something plane something plane josiah
you can put them in the garbage or you can keep them brenda is going to collect the tracing paper 0 i am waiting thank you kanye for sitting quietly even though i think you have a pencil that needs to be parked
all right 16 rows i love that 16 rows i am glad that you counted them let us get some other noticings i saw keshet i am going to try to get everyone if i do not get you for this one i can probably get you for the wonder okay we will go keshet i noticed that it looks like it looks like what a graphing chart 0 a graphing chart but with what without the
no no wait why no because i am flipping it what is our fancy word for flipping hold on i need a quiet 0 thank you corbin to reflect
i did not start on it because you said we needed to
but how did you so you said you have the answer could you tell me how you came up with that answer so basically you can get one of the slices and trace it and copy it there and you could turn it and you can measure it i think it is like 60 or 30 or 90 okay so we have a couple of numbers we are throwing out we have 60 you said 60 60
so watch me if we take this remember what we did yesterday let us reflect it over let us reflect it over does that make sense no
yeah so i am also going to label it i would label it too can you all label it like this on here we will just put b we will put c i already did it i already did it i already did it 0 thank you kanye ahead of the game so what we are going to do should i go and translate it like this does a translation look like this no no it absolutely does not right because i am rotating it as i am going should my translation look like this no
so it is going to intersect
i wonder you can keep yourself on that page is this a good right here 0 yeah
14 and 13 i love the communication 14 13 what do you need 10 11
pimples i thought they are meant to be a star no
the orange tag or the middle desk if your partner is nonverbal you can look on the thing and you do it silently and when you get to your computer do what you are supposed to yeah do what you are supposed to do and then when you are done with that i think you can throw away those papers and when you are done with that you sit at your table hands crossed like this and with a bubble
guess okay maybe guess i do not think we are going to have to guess why is it important to select all that apply is there one answer
a coordinate plane a coordinate plane it looks like a grid or a coordinate plane without squares without squares all right i am going to take one more for our noticings one more for our noticings damari i noticed that there is a type of pattern between the triangles
what is going on
and 0 my friends wait a 2nd i am hearing a lot of noise even though i know our directions were to go silently and i think i saw something leave somebody is hand travel through the air and hit somebody else and i would really love if someone wearing green pants that are not uniform would pick it up thank you did you have to say what type of color pants
what is the meaning of the yeah so what is the meaning of what is the meaning of this right what is the meaning all right bradley why is it diagonal ooh why is it diagonal we are definitely going to find that out why is it diagonal let us do the last one damari
0 hold on and i am just saying we can look back you know that it is all recorded remember last year yeah so we can look back so whoever said what we will know all right okay so i love the way that i am seeing let us all turn our attention to jermaine no
wait why am i not translating you are moving 0 sorry i heard a ghost say i heard a ghost say 0 yeah jermaine thank you for raising a quiet hand
okay yes 0 this is going to happen this is the are you trying not to look at yes she keeps looking back and she keeps looking at me so tegan to finish answering your question yes you can do that and you will still end up with the same solution daniel go ahead okay this the last one now what is the error and what can be corrected garia
0 so i did 9 -16 is equals to -7 all right so that is what i needed to see how did you get from here to here okay thank you so
could you go over number 6 because i got number 6 number 6 remind me of the page please 0 209 209 okay whoop got it 209 number 6 209
i can divide both sides well remember that is the number this is the variable term i am trying to isolate that variable so what i can do here you can divide both by -50 over 21
okay i will add one half on both sides okay so then i have 2 sevenths x is equal to 2 thirds times x 4 x -one +one half and then you can expand it so
i can divide both the top and bottom by 3 so i have x 7 over what 100 7 over 100 so i could do that right we have all of this and we got to our final answer what did you get
0 you move the variable term to the okay if i subtract 3 a -3 a i end up with 6 is equal to -8 so wait but then you are kind of so is that a true statement no so then when we have something like this there is no solution yes pretty
well i divided both sides by 3 because i got 36 is equal to 3 x okay and then i need to divide both sides by 3 and that gives me x is equal to 12 amant so what would happen on number one if you multiply both sides by 3
+12 is equal to 6 a -0 16 okay no yeah -28 because yeah because you would subtract 12 from both sides because it is 68 +12 or you
all right so i have 2 sevenths x is equal to 8 thirds x -16th what is next
do i need to make it bigger for you tian i am fine there let us see i will try it always looks larger on my screen than it does on the on the big screen is that a little bit better yeah they are huge
you can multiply them both by 21 multiply both sides by 21 yeah no never mind
but is not it what we just did in the one yesterday
so i have 620 firsts x -and then what is 7 times 8 56 okay and that is equal to -one sixths okay so then where do i go from here rudy then you subtract 56 from 6
okay yeah i had paused it okay that is fine okay all right that is all right if we are not done we will just go over these together so for the 1st one what should i do who can tell me okay tian walk me through
well if you subtracted 2 thirds from both sides all you are really doing is moving the numbers back and forth because remember the 2 thirds v is a variable term and then the other 2 are numbers what is it 4 thirds so are you saying to subtract this on both sides yeah is that possible
entire class i got stuck on the order yeah i tried i did get 2.9 r equals 6.7 m that makes sense 0 wow that is cool 0 wow that is so fancy okay all right how far are we on this i am done i
all right so i have 115 is equal to 25 r and now i can divide both sides by 25 and i can reduce if i need to yes so i will have r is equal to so what is the common factor between these 2 the largest common factor between these 255 okay so what is 115 divided by 5
okay so that is something we need to make sure we know so that is why whatever we are doing having an indicator of what we are doing would be helpful so i go ahead amant so can i just make it positive
multiplying it by the reciprocal of 2 sevenths you will still end up with a fraction if you just multiply by the reciprocal so you just need to multiply it by the denominator correct since we have just one fraction i am trying to eliminate that fraction okay so then tegan for yours so what was your question for number 25 -42 correct
yay yay all right clean up
it is trying to find me you can do it we just want to go back to that color looks really nice okay there we go yay yay me yes there could be a nursery rhyme i do not understand 4 and 6 i tried expanding it i tried not expanding it but it does not make sense
could we use so we get to 2 sevenths x -2 sevenths x equals to x that would be -one sevenths can we do 42 i could do 42 but what would that value you would still end up with your same solution but i could also multiply each of them by 42 to get rid of
on this side yeah 15 -4 a equals 6 which then would you do -15 from both sides so you get -4 a equals -9 and then would you divide by -4
yeah so 209 number 6 so number 6 says 2 thirds v is equal to 2 minus something okay so we have 2 thirds v is equal to 2 -4 thirds mister chase huh i added 4 thirds to both sides and it is well here we need to simplify 1st because we have
would you still multiply by
and then would you multiply it by the same thing you got 3 so i would multiply this side by 3 and then multiply that by 3 yes
okay sure yeah what is it 23 it is not 23 23 okay 115 divided by 23 so 23 and then what is 25 divided by 5 5 all right so then we have r is equal to 23 fifths i can leave it as an improper fraction or i can turn it into a mixed number which would give me 4 and 3 fifths that is our answer i thought r equals 5.5 so did i get something wrong
okay or multiply by 21 over 50 by -21 over 50 because these 2 would cancel these 2 would cancel then i have x is equal to and then -one sixths times 21 or -21 over 50 and then what do i have what is 21 -one times 21 and then 6 times 50 is what
well if you did that i would divide here by 4 and i will divide here by 4 so then i will have on the left hand side x is equal to x over 4 +9 so then that is also correct
well no that is not the answer because we have not solved for x yet because i still have this equation here x over 4 +9 is equal to x so i still have not solved for x yet yes please for number 5 if you minus x from the would it be as 36 equals 3 x
i both sides by 2 and then i got 12 minus x and then equals one.2 one.6 and one.2 is and i subtracted 12 from both sides and just got -one is 10.8 and here you can just say we will subtract both sides by -one and then get x is 10.8
so 2 sevenths times 42 would just be 12 because 7 goes into 426 times so it will just be 12 x for that one then we will have to see how many times does 3 go into 42 it goes in 14 times
0 i forgot there we go wonderful what did i do with my clicker there it is thank you sia okay do we have any questions on our homework from last class yes tegan
do we have to wait for number 5 how would you get 12 because is not it x +36 divided by 4 remember i subtracted x on both sides so if i have 4 x minus x gives me 3 x and then 36 divided by 3 gives me 120 so you can not do an x +36 divided by 4
yeah so we have 2 numbers so we would need to simplify for this one so here it would be 6 over 3 okay so then i have 2 thirds v is equal to 6 over 3 -4 over 3 so i need to simplify that or before i even continue with this 0 i was correct i thought the correct answer
so i do not know if this is an error but what i wrote was because it expanded so when you are expanding you need to keep in mind the sign so when you do -2 times negative y the answer will be positive because it is 2 negatives yes is that the only error is it i do not know i just went past right there and i am like okay that is the error right there right
okay so just do what you think and then we are going to go over it all right what
well if i subtract x on both sides and if i have x minus x +36 is equal to 4 x minus x what is x minus x a 0 so yes so it is but how do you get rid of the x just say x is equal to 12
all right well obviously we can okay then i can move here on 5 here on 6 how are we doing liam what do you have everything but 4 everything but 4 and 2 i did not finish 2
okay and then that is equal to 67 r +53 so now the one thing you should keep in mind when you are doing this always move the smaller variable term to the larger variable term so i will do -42 r on both sides so now i have 67 r -42 r yes why do you do that yeah wait why would you do that for the variable thing
so i can add -2 thirds +one half so what would that give me i am just going to continue to rewrite 2 sevenths here x is equal to 8 x over 3 -4 sixths and that is going to be 4 sixths +3 sixths so 7 sixths and what does that give me 7 sixths 0 -16th
yes i know negative divided by a negative is a positive okay negative is +and wait wait is a not negative a is not negative because remember i am dividing by -4 on both sides so then i have here and i have -9 divided by -4 which would give me a positive so i have that would be including
okay so walk me through you and i will go through with it so what would i do what should i do so you could subtract one half from both sides okay i can subtract one half from both sides but remember if i do that wait no you can add one half
25 25 yeah okay we have 25 r +53 and then i will subtract 53 on both sides so i have 168 -53 so i have 10 110 the one and then 5 115
correct all right what about for 3 tegan come on up so talk us through it also
so i have 4 ninths and i can reduce it to 2 and 14 if i need to but improper fractions are okay yeah you can turn it into a decimal too if you want but there is no need to were we supposed to solve that
okay so what you just said right there all right could i have done that in the beginning would that have worked yeah it could have is 21 divisible by 2 no
so you 1st change it to equals and change the 5 sixths to 15 over 18 so why would i change the 5 sixths to 15 over 18 so it is easier to to 13rd would not it be easier to change the 13rd 0 yeah i forgot about that that is okay it is equivalent to 2 sixths
i have a question about the test go ahead did you post the answers but our grade i have not not yet it will be posted today and then it will be handed to you all tomorrow 0 but that is not within the week wait tomorrow
yes but i will double check your work yes i did not multiply it by 10 then i used the decimals and i got 4.6 r which is the i mean r equals 4.6 that is what you would get because 4 and 3 fifths is can i do that way or this way
yeah i understood that right correct so what are you deciding to do so what did you decide to do
yes it is the whole thing okay then how do i do x divided by 4 well now you have a fraction it is 14th x so then you would have to okay so then i will not do that next time i mean you can it is just you are adding a bit more complexity for you into 6 is
so how did we get what is that this no i am saying what is this number 720 fourths so how would you get a -720 fourths
do we have to do that do what the times 7 and times 7 you do not have to but it makes your work a bit more efficient and easier to work with but it is up to you all right tegan and when you you do that would you put parenthesis on that yeah hold that question just for a moment garia do you have a question for one yeah can you just multiply it by the inverse
i am sorry do not worry daniel 0 this is a dumb question which track are you on huh this is a dumb question but no i should not it is malfunctioning 0 we are going around in a circle it is tracking all it is malfunctioning
so what should you do for that one i think that i do not have to do it that way i am just asking what are you doing for that one i am minusing this and i am going to minus that so subtracting 6 on both sides wait do i have to subtract 6 from the whole thing well that is a variable term that is a numeral so you can not subtract 6 from
multiply both sides by 15 multiply both sides by 15 and why would i do that liam because if you just multiply it by 5 the fraction 13rd would become one and 2 thirds
okay so i know i am going to subtract 13rd from both sides and i have here 5 sixths -13rd is equal to d so now i can change this to give me 5 sixths -2 sixths is equal to d so what is 5 -2 5 -2 is 3
yeah you can leave it as decimals or you can turn it into whole numbers i always show the option to turn into whole numbers because sometimes people do not like to work with decimals but yeah go ahead come on i have a question on number one okay so could you also multiply both sides by 3 you can if but it would make it harder though right
yes so we are wrapping up the lesson all right so we went over solving equations with fractions and decimals so what are some things all right we need to keep in mind when we are solving so when solving it is important to perform the order of operations in reverse by adding or subtracting before we multiply and divide just like we were doing i thought if it is we have to simplify it
i multiplied both sides by 3 instead of 15 but i still got the same answer that is fine it probably took you a few more steps to get to that solution and then so for this last one what can we do or 2nd to last one what can we do we have 3 fractions 3 different denominators that it is not quite clear for what we can do rudy what do you think what would you decide to do for 3 i did not get to 3
it is possible you will end up with 0 here is equal to 2 -4 thirds -2 thirds v wait but does not v equal remember it is -4 thirds -2 thirds
yes they are all graded i just have not had the time to put them in the grade book yet if you want to come after school you can grab them after school really yes so during like after my lunch during office hours you can grab them during office hours if you need to wait can we come during lunch during lunch it will not be inputted during lunch because guess what i got to eat lunch yeah but can we come and get it during lunch you actually eat during lunch
okay so you -60 on both sides okay what number is that 54
think about that did we forget something 0 we made a
okay and i get -50 all right okay do not forget and then where do i go from here and then you can divide both by -one sixths
okay i can expand it so i am just going to start here to 2 sevenths x is equal to and then i have 8 thirds x -2 thirds +one half okay and then you can add -2 thirds +one half
okay i have 3 sixths is equal to d which would then be a half is equal to d so that should be my solution for that one so then what about the 2nd one all right go up and talk us through what you are doing
yeah okay so is it okay if i represent yeah that is fine so talk us through what are you doing eliza
0 too much thank you
300 wait what about the remember i am multiplying both sides so they cancel out so i have x is equal to 21 over 300 can i reduce from there maybe yeah 0 yeah yeah yeah you can okay what can i reduce them by you can divide both the top and bottom by 3
you can make both the denominators 21
but you can do that you can because remember i am doing the same thing to both sides of the equation keeping it balanced and now i can either distribute the 42 to both of these terms or i can divide the 42 on both sides so let us distribute so i have 42 r +and what is 42 times 4 168
so for number 6 i expanded the 2 parentheses 3 a so this expression on the right hand side okay yeah but once i expanded it then i subtracted 12 from both sides because yeah and then i got 6 a equals 6 a -20
a on 2 sides yes okay so if you subtract 6 a on both sides then you have 0 is equal to -28 which is still a false statement that means you do not have a solution for this one so then tian so for number 4 to make it a non decimal do you just times 10 by both sides correct it would just multiply garia did you finish asking your question yeah okay and then aliyah
yeah yeah i sometimes lose track of time yeah if you subtract 13rd do you have to subtract it from this and this or just one so you are subtracting 13rd from both sides yeah
you can but just imply that you are going to multiply both sides by -one yeah so that will turn the answer positive
well this is just saying to keep in mind it is important to perform those operations in reverse so if i have an example here let us say 2 x -5 is equal to 10 i am going to add 5 to both sides before because usually you would multiply and then but why can not you do 2 x divided by 2 and then you reverse it well so if i yeah yeah why can not you do that
i can make both the denominators 21 okay so i can move this over so i have 2 sevenths x -8 thirds x is equal to -one sixths so i can make both the denominators 21 i am just going to move this up here just so we have a bit more room to work with so then what did i have to multiply 7 by to get 21 3
would you check my work on number 5 i do not know what i did wrong all right so while i check that sia can you erase the board for me it was kind of untidy but on number 5 i did x +36 equals 4 x then i did x +36 divided by 4 so that is the error right there because you forgot to divide x by 4 because all you did was divide x by 360 it is all that okay
is the answer one yeah that is what i got yes the answer is one i got it correct i did a different i did a different i added 4 thirds to what was and i had 6 thirds and i divided by 6 thirds on both sides and got one could you subtract 2 thirds from both sides and then solve it
no this was me going over this for you all yeah so this is with fractions keep in mind what i just talked about what you should do what you can do do you have to do it no but it is helpful to do it okay so solve these ones 0 now we can do it
okay but i could also find a common denominator for these 3 to kind of eliminate those fractions if i wanted to so this is not incorrect you get to your answer too tegan yes
yes just check your work again so why would you multiply both okay so you multiply both sides by 10 okay good good and then what would you do here -60
the g is for the 1st one so i multiply the so what did you do from here to get to here i multiplied one.5 by 2 okay so make sure you show that okay okay so i multiply them both by this
i know it is amazing how teachers have to eat okay mister yes for the test will you have to write it in decimal because for this 1st question no i wrote in fractions okay you are fine can i go to the bathroom
where would you get 1242 x 0 it is because so this would 2 sevenths
well either or with this one you would end up with 0 is equal to -28 which is still a false statement what so you will still end up with 0 as equal to -28 so you said you subtracted 12 on both sides yes and then so you are left with i am just going to move it up here 6 a is equal to 6 a -28 yes yeah and then you subtracted 6 a on both sides
150 $150 for the computer she earns $14 each hour at her job okay underline the question how many hours did jada need to work to earn the remaining money she needs to buy the computer how many what what is my label hours
okay so it makes it 11 but 111s okay you need to go homework yeah okay so 11 -9 is 2
she does although 14 an hour is not bad i would say it is pretty good all right so what do we need to do divide
okay 5 are there any groups that are still working on theirs no nope
okay we can not do one -6 so we go next door and borrow 10 more 11 -6 50 i already know what i need to put next 4 we already did that so $14 per hour how many hours would she have to work 44 hours she basically needs to work 2 days 0 my god
very good 2 plus the 5 is 7 and the 710s come down for a total of 77 drinks okay so bj which expression did you choose a
8 hey i am hearing a lot of side conversation i need us to do this together and remain focused please so 8 times 3 is 8 times 3 is 24 24 -24 is 0 bring down the 9 9 divided by 3 is 3 3

$383 which makes sense because we said whatever she saved okay that times 3 would give us the cost of the computer so that does make sense okay so she is saved $383 and her parents gave her how much 150
water there are so if i have 4 cases 1234 think about it this way draw the tape diagram use a read write draw tool okay i have 4 cases of water okay and each case has how many bottles hello everyone 20 20 20 20
hours so that is what we are going to have for our answer how many hours so 1st let us examine the question what information do we already know so we already know let us go through each sentence jada is saving for what a computer a computer and how much does that computer cost 1149
5 cans yeah we know she also has juice and she has 5 cans of juice and we want to know how many drinks so we are trying to figure out how much water plus how much what juice juice juice very good so before we could add the water and juice bj what do i need to do figure out how many what bottles of water there are
no 11 yes okay so remember when we do long division you remember do monkeys smell bad d stands for divide divide m multiply s subtract b bring down
$2 so now knowing what we kind of had to do to solve 1st we had to figure out how many total pens then we had to then once we had that information then could we solve it yes okay so would it make sense that they chose b it was 18 divided by whatever 4 +5 was well what is 4 +5 because we always solve what is in parentheses 1st 99
so you can sit here with this group so we had 1234 and one yeah so you guys are doing is not that cool yeah but right now we are going to focus
yes okay we are going to do this together okay so as you see the number on the board as a class you are skip counting it all right so multiples of 8 so we have 88 16 24
okay another keyword if all the pens were to cost the same amount which is very important to know that so we are looking for total and equal groups right yeah okay what is the cost for one pen okay so leo buys 4 blake buys 5 so how many pens do we have
money money does she have but here is another keyword left over how much money does she have left okay so 1st what information do we know okay let me make some space up here money
yeah then she spends $5 right yeah okay so we need to 1st figure out 18 times what times 4 4 and when i say 1st that is when i put those parentheses around it because when i look at my order of operations what is the 1st thing you always do parentheses
in terms of what expression they think matches theirs we are all good yeah
okay so a lot of different things happening right so what strategy do we use to help us cube
losing so i had this but now i am taking away $5 right i am taking away $5 so 72 -5 what is 12 -5 6 6 not 6 what about 7 7
0 and i am giving everyone a minute walking around jayden okay so 9 -3 6 4 -3 one one -5 can not do that can not do it so we need to go next door and borrow 10 more 11 -5 6
how many hours does she need to work in order to earn the remaining money so my label is not money do i need to figure out how much more money she needs in order to figure out how many hours yes yes but the label in the question is asking how many what hours
and then if you have to bring down you must repeat so 11 divided by 3 is how many groups of 3 go into 11 without going over it 3 okay let us skip count by 3s ready 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 would be too many right yeah so how many groups 3
divide all right so her remaining amount is $616 and she makes $14 per hour so however many hours times 14 to give us 616 okay we need to do this before we could go so can 14 go into 6 no what about 61 yes
2 after we subtract we bring down and then repeat 24 divided by 3 what number times 3 gives me 24 8 so if we skip count by 3 everyone 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 21 20 4 how many groups of 3 is that
yeah because 123 groups of 3 3 times 3 is 9 subtract okay how much money has jada saved 383
we have to subtract good so the total cost of the computer is 1149 -533 minus how much money she has go ahead and solve that
2 so how much do you think each pen costs 2
9 because that was the total number of pens okay and $18 is what it costs is that exactly what we did over there yeah
i think the number of kids exactly okay what information do we know okay so we already know that group one has 18 kids okay and then there are 4 groups that each have 5 okay that is all the okay decide together i want you to think what expression would make the most sense
15 30 45 60 60 all right so i know that 1234 groups of 15 is pretty close right so should we try 4 groups of 14 yes all right so 14 times 4 what is 4 times 4 16
so i leave the 6 carry the one 10 over 4 times one 4 4 +one is 5 so 510s so 56 okay do you think we could do one more group of 14 or do you think that is good that is good yeah we would be over right so 4 groups of 14 is 56 okay 61 -56 is 5 5
very good whoopsie whoopsie where was that one supposed there we go okay i did not do the line before whew that was a lot of work huh yes all right turn to the next page
how many kids are at the camp so we are looking for a what total total total we are looking for the total amount of kids 1st so we circled we underlined we boxed now let us examine the question okay we know that our label is how many what kids
999 so our 1st step would be to combine and figure out the total amount of pens so you guys agree that 1st we would have to do 4 +5 to get 9 pens yeah
so we know she needs another $616 that is the amount of money remaining but what is the question asking us how many more hours how many more hours she needs to work in order to earn another $616 so we have one more step she needs $616 and she makes $14 per hour she needs to get a better job
woo that was a lot huh okay i am going to ask you to stay in that seat just because you opted out and i do not want you in the yeah there you go is that okay is she okay yeah can you sit there thank you yeah okay there you go honey you can see okay right you got this all right so we did that with multiples of 8 do you think we could do that with multiples of 9 yeah yeah
44 hours very good all right my friends we will continue picking this up tomorrow so we can
no no no no okay go ahead together read situation 2 and decide how you would solve it and then look at the expressions and decide which expression matches that situation work as a group so did you guys read situation 3 together yes
very good each case has how many bottles 18

so is this group correct thumbs up or thumbs down great job nice job all right okay back table who is my captain for that table please stand read the situation 2 nice and loud
so what do you guys think okay so because you guys are in it so we are focused on this though right now okay so you guys are expression or situation 2 at camp okay one group has 18 kids and 4 groups have 5 kids each how many kids are at the camp so what are we looking for here
72 okay so that is 72 but then if i have $72 okay but then i spend 5 am i gaining $5 or am i losing $5 minus losing
very good so let us 1st cube it so we know that she mows 4 lawns and gets paid $18 per is an operation word per lawn if luna spends $5 spends is also an important keyword here how much money does she have left over what is my label money money if you look at the question we are looking for how much what everyone
absolutely because it is the 18 bottles of 4 cases and we said that 72 plus the 5 cans of juice which gave us 77 drinks all right last one back table who is speaking okay william go ahead
150 okay so we know that she has saved so if the computer costs 3 times as much as what she has saved she has saved 3 times less right which means we are doing what division
all right bj go ahead and read situation 3 out loud 1st go ahead sona buys 4 cases of water each case has 18 bottles if she has 5 cans of juice how many total drinks does she have
luna mows 4 lawns and she gets paid $18 per lawn if luna spends $5 how much money does she have left over
very good so to figure out how much water we could do 4 times 18 because that might be a little faster right yeah all right so what is 18 times 4 everyone what is 4 times 8 32 32 so i leave the 2 carry the 310s 4 times one 4 4 okay +3 7
so you would 1st multiply the 18 times 4 okay so 1st let us think about this so we know our labels are drinks right we are looking for total drinks okay so 1st if we go by sentence sona buys 4 cases of water and each case has 18 bottles so that is information we know right yep
cube we already cube would we already figured out our label we already said the information we have what information do i need in order to solve what is my 1st step going to be so you multiply 4 times 5
good if i am writing you are writing okay so that is the total cost right yeah okay that is 3 times as much money as she has already saved 3 times means what more 3 times means what
540 630 630 720 720 810 810 900 900 man i really slowed it down that time huh yeah
okay 72 so this equals 72 bottles right yes this equals 72 plus the what 55 cans of juice how many drinks do they have total everyone 77 77
okay now 14 is not a number i just skip count in my head naturally right so i am going to think of a number that is close to 14 to skip count by and then use that estimation to help give me an idea of how many groups of 14 to do so skip count by 15 go
circle key numbers and other points u underline the question b box operation clues e explain the question and s solve it step by step
okay at camp a group has 18 kids and 4 groups have 5 kids each how many kids are at the camp so at 1st we did so 1st we did 20 +18 okay so yeah underline 1st one group has 18 kids
divide so we would say we have $18 right divided by the 9 pens okay would give us how much for each pen okay because it said same amount so 18 divided by 9 or what number times 9 would give us 18 2 2
okay and we also know that all the pens were $18 so if i have 9 pens all 9 pens cost $18 how would i figure out how much each pen costs what do we think divide
pemdas okay what does the p stand for parentheses what about the e exponents exponents exponents okay what about the m i am sorry thank you m multiply multiplication what about the d divide then a a for addition and subtraction
16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800
yeah okay nice and loud
there we go 0 technology all right one group has 18 kids we know that we know that 4 groups have 5 kids each they do not have 5 kids all together they have 5 kids each okay so the question says how many what kids what is my label kids
bottles total what not bottles not juice how many total what drinks drinks look at the question how many total drinks so that is water and juice right all right so bj go ahead and tell me how would you solve this bj
yeah if i was to draw a tape diagram okay she mows 4 lawns and makes $18 for each lawn right but then she spends how much 5 5

okay sorry i was going to answer those in all right so at camp we have one group has 18 kids we know that and we know that 4 groups 0 the board turned off what just happened what just happened 0 i am scared
so notice i put the 3 over the 11 3 times 3 is 9 9 subtract can you do one -9 yes yes no no no so what do we need to do everyone it is this many borrow go next door and borrow 10 more right 0 wow wait so it makes it 11
533 okay so 3 +0 is 3 8 +5 is 13 one +3 4 +one 5 so she has $533 okay but the cost of the computer is $1149 so how much is remaining is our next step we have to subtract this is a big one
that she spends $50 that she spends $5 which means she is using that right and then the question says how much money is left okay so william what is the 1st thing i need to do what information do i need to figure out in order to solve this how much money she had in total
7 because we could not do the 2 -5 so we had to go next door and borrow 10 more okay 6 minus nothing 6 so how much money does she have left 67 yeah after she mows the lawn and then spends the 5 she now has $67 left so william what was the correct expression c
so we know that we have 4 cases of water and each case has how many 18 18 yeah 18 bottles per case not as much room to write when we have so many situations up here all right what else do we know we know that she also has what
huh did we say group one was 18 yep yes and we said plus however many were in the other 4 groups yes which if we were to do what is in parentheses 1st we said that would make 20 so 18 +20 which gives us 38 kids would that be correct thumbs up or thumbs down everyone thumbs up nice job all right this group who is the captain bj
45 54 54 63 63 72 81 81 90 90 okay now the multiples of 90 90 180 180 together 270 270 360 360 450 450 540
she earns $14 each hour okay so that is all the information we know from the information they gave us correct yeah
no each case has how many bottles 18 18 thank you so this is water +5 cans of juice 5 cans of juice juice juice in order to figure out how many total drinks i have i could add all those up but what would be faster than adding 184 times bj 4 times 18
multiply good so 4 times 5 is what 20 20 20 20 okay so i know that one group has 18 and the other 4 groups has what 18 18 18 and the other 4 groups have 20 20 kids okay so now can i combine those to find a total amount of kids who were at the camp
yeah okay so 18 +20 is what 38 18 +20 is 38 so how many kids were at the camp 38 38 what kids children 38 kids so joey this group how many or i am sorry what letter did you say what expression does it match d huh d d would that make sense
okay well how much money she made from mowing the 4 lawns is what we 1st need to do that is information we need so we could solve we can not solve until we know how much money she made mowing those lawns so how would i do that 18 times 4
what is in parentheses yeah so 18 times 4 will tell me how much she made okay which is what we just solved that in the last one 77 we just solved this hopefully no what is it 72 72
okay so you guys think b all right before we decide and you give me thumbs up or thumbs down let us cube it together okay so leo buys how many pens 44 pens blake buys 55 pens i see an operation word here what is it total total in all okay the total cost of the pens is how much 18 so all the pens are $18 right yeah
so now we need to figure out how much money she has in total before we need to figure out how many more hours she needs to work so my 2nd step is to do what landon to add 383 +150
okay so we are going to do multiples of 9 and 90 let me slow down the speed okay as you see it on the screen together we are reading each number 9 9 18 9 18 27 27 36 36 45
very good so 1st let us cube it let us use the strategy to cube it okay so what does c stand for circle circle circle everyone what does c stand for circle numbers and labels okay so sona buys 4 cases of water each is a what i box it each is
what information do we know william we know that she mows how many lawns we know she is mowed 4 lawns and got 18 for each lawn she mows and she makes $18 for each lawn right yep good what else do we know landon
no we are not do your best okay can i have these 312 and 3 go ahead and write something on the board i do not want you to use those if it is not for class purposes so erase it and put yeah do you ever yawn do you ever have regular and then everyone says you are crying when you are not yeah exactly nobody is ever said that to me
the idea you are talking about between an equation and inequality is that we need more than 0 yeah i mean you can yeah someone was definitely saying that earlier they were like well do not you always flip the sign just with an equal sign it does not matter
integer integers and rational rational so remember so are all integers rational numbers yeah no yes yes so can someone actually explain this venn diagram because this is the one we used in class it is actually wrong what it is actually wrong 0 i want to hear this yeah wait what you just said all integers were rational 0 no my bad
all right now is your time some of these answer keys or problems sorry answers on the answer key were wrong so let us just it is not simplified just to think so that was wrong and this one is wrong about 36 -7 and she still did not finish she is not it beautiful i think it is beautiful too yeah you got the best in the world do you think so i just changed the ink
every single time i have a secret paper my pencil breaks 0 that is interesting correlation is not causation all right great it is a work that we only have the paper is translucent or transparent or whatever translucent
0 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what did you get for number 3 is that a one there why is it in his hand so flip the wait are you doing the homework no i am just checking answers do homework already i think so it is tough to imagine i can double check 0 okay 0 i am stupid
a rational number can not be negative right it can be negative yeah yeah yeah we are going to go over those too and then also on the test will there be anything like explain and we have to write in sentences no i just like doing these because it helps us to understand better
whole number yeah so it is a whole number and rational but it is not just rational so you really want to look at the most simplified version of the number you have is there another category called natural numbers yeah but we are not going to yeah i love all your questions but sometimes we have other stuff to do yeah so then square roots of negatives what kind of are they irrational complex but let us not talk about it yeah
one side is integer and then the other side is the whole number that is right so this is integer yeah right can you raise your hand if you are done with one and 2 no i got 7 6 and a 4 okay take a little more time i forgot to do number 2 fraction i definitely can
how did you do 6 today i got this yeah i got yeah because you forgot to distribute the negative we distribute the negative so then y is on the 0 this is the same as -3 x 0 it was minus yeah i forgot yeah either or that is fine no i forgot -5 x existed you cover your own back no no no no no at least i made sure this was positive no no no
we should solve the easiest problem 1st what solve the easiest problem solve the easiest 1st solve the bonus 1st no but the bonus is so much easier than all
ism okay i think it was
because if it is in the smaller category the smaller category fits in the bigger category which is in an even bigger category so that number is in all the categories yeah exactly yeah and we can see how that works just in the venn diagram sorry not the same as the typical ones we see where we have 2 and then some overlap between but we actually have whole categories contained in other whole categories so that should definitely help so integers are always in both integers and rational numbers what number of categories is 0 in
whole whole integers integers and rational it is in whole also whole whole did he say it was +and 0 that is not okay and bringing it back up here what about pi what are the number categories for pi irrational
9 times 0 my nail the division same why did you no you have to sound more confident do you know what that means you have to sound more confident what is wrong with us it is just i do not have our lecture back on can you tell us just something to make it
yeah 100.5 is 100.5 an integer no 0 yeah
yeah they have to be whenever you are done writing feel free to share what you wrote with your group and then we will talk about it as a class
rational whole numbers yeah well i guess they can be no one told me about what about 9 over 9 that is an integer yeah yes yeah
no one is ever said that no people have asked me that before and can i have my 0 wait nevermind are you crying are you mad at me can you put steven can you put the yeah this is fine can i have you put those 3 on those 3 desks in the back back in the middle face down those 3 so the one with jerry
yeah because it is not written okay that is a good point yeah when do you have to flip the inequality when does it have to happen isha when multiplying or dividing by a negative great okay so that is our main and remember with inequalities you also get a range of values for 2 this looks good i would not expect to see common errors here actually maybe some decimal division like decimal in the wrong place but that is about it what do you think the common error would be here andrew yeah you do not convert it into a mixed number
yes absolutely so if you look on the math quote board in the back one of them is always remember to distribute the negative for exactly this reason so make sure you are doing that i actually was just grading some algebra one tests and students for sure made this mistake so it is a great thing to remember okay last one we have a word problem when we have a word problem what should we always include in our answer units units or in this case votes votes
it is not but it still counts as a whole number so what is it was there any question so then pi would be pi is irrational so we have not technically talked about irrational numbers even though we kind of have in a way but you could just say it is none of them it is not in any of the categories
irrational is we have talked about it as in we have talked about it the book has not talked about it and of course yeah it does you can say irrational if you want i will accept irrational can i say none you can say none pi is none right pi is none what did you do to them good for you
so good so good do you need a marker the markers yeah 0 i know it is really inky i know 0 no it is okay i am okay with this 10 the marker is integer so let us start off with a review of just the number groups we have 3 number groups what are the 3 number groups that we talked about steven
cool looks good wait ms nelson wait for number 3 what go on the camera will you ever be on camera i have to walk over there i got that wrong because remember it all he did he just did no 4 and 3 fourths
yeah especially if it is a common error if i know 30% of students are going to do this then i should probably ask you to remember it i am still going to do it anyways you still you know what is funny actually i have done this myself a couple of times but i hope that me i know
no isha you have not been on the board today right you have not done anything on the board okay go ahead and do it yeah you get it wait did what occurred my mom would not allow it i was supposed to go back into the classroom i guess i did not ask this but you chose to accept accept it you would
number one andrew which one do you want 33 and then laura is 2 okay okay great let us get those on the board since you have done these already go ahead and talk about them in your groups check your answers make sure you have labels all those good things for number one i actually all right problem what did you get for number one x is less than or equal to 9 yeah so what she got the julia julia what did you get for one
come over here okay i myself like so many times in this class also have to try to not get distracted because sometimes i think things are fun too okay so can you raise your hand if you have finished the 4 problems on the board we have okay great can you raise your hand if you would like to do one on the board cool let us have devia which one do you want number 44 okay ivanka number one
here you go this is for you ms nelson can you come here are you writing here how about you write and i will walk around wait not to me not to me could you go the other way i am not going to go all the way 0 but i do not need to right as long as you stay there
irrational or okay so secret or there was a secret that was breached a little bit because really we are not supposed to be talking about irrational numbers but we are anyway so given that you do not know irrational numbers what could we say about pi none none okay it is not in any of the categories what about -one.3 repeating integer not an integer decimal decimals are not integers
wait if the original quote is from andrew does not that mean it should say andrew yeah i think it should i think that people maybe did not know that it was from someone erased these yeah i know i can change it that is fine are you ready what is our motto
yeah for inequality it is range and for equations number yeah yeah just one number exactly okay and then common mistakes which i hope no one does this we have talked about this so many times now julia by not distributing the negative
secret paper i love the secret paper yeah what if i accidentally write 0 my god are you okay i almost got you 0 my god secret paper secret paper it is such a big deal i am so scared i know right okay we are not writing on this yet right so write secret paper on the back i am going to need to give you this you got another secret paper
3.9 repeating also a whole number yes right yeah so you do have to be careful to simplify you really would not write you would not use that as a number if you were doing a problem unless you wanted to be sneaky for some reason so yeah i would say do not write 3.9 repeating as 3.9 repeating you would write that as 4 yeah can i use the restroom
it does not face down it does not go down no i guess not the number you will have to figure out a way to be famous rational
0 is a whole no i am asking are whole numbers nonnegative whole numbers have to be positive no whole numbers have to be positive except 11 is not positive what one is not necessarily positive or negative what positive i think you are thinking 0 do not you mean 0 you mean 0 you mean 0 yeah 0 is not positive you said 100 my whole life is a lie i said one that is okay you know what all of our brains fart sometimes
it is a weird fraction of what 2 each
wait so you are saying you can also flip the equality 10 someone said that earlier i think that is why i was asking how do you know you can yeah the one in the center on the center no there is one on the center the idea
yeah can you raise your hand if you were going to say that ratio of 2 integers okay that is the official definition i just say that because if you have one.6 over 3 that is not quite enough to show that it is a rational number so you want to have actually integers for that and then we talked about this but one key difference between solving an equation and solving an inequality is what ivanka with inequalities if you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number the sign has to flip definitely maya
yeah so it is kind of an unknown value just like how the value is we just do not know the value we also do not know what number category it is in okay what is an example of a whole number 0 wait sorry what is an example of an integer that is not a whole number matthew -3 -3 okay -100 huh steven -one -one alright 100.5 100.5
okay so those are your 5 numbers make sure you are being careful about all of the number groups that each of them are a part of and then go ahead and convert those 2 so we have one fraction or sorry decimal to fraction one fraction to decimal yeah would this whole number be nonnegative or positive a whole number has to be +0 and 0 if that is your question yeah that is nonnegative 0 is rational 0 is it is not positive nonnegative but is 0 but is 0 a whole number
flipping that sign or forgetting that -one counts as a number when it is i do not know but i got negative x was less than or equal to -9 so not flipping the sign or forgetting -one and you are saying it is even harder when it is negative x versus -2 x yeah you might forget that it is there it is
study come to office hours and because you are taking your test on wednesday actually there are also office hours tomorrow i will be here for that too i do not know and one of the things yeah so office hours today or office hours tomorrow either is fine yeah 32 -7 i forgot how to do that i gave up i feel stupid no in the middle of the speed run yeah okay i did not know so ivanka can you talk
on this chapter so far you are actually a big help yeah no no no we got damon is favorite food spot the same
but then 0 when we say is going to be on camera recorded but would 0 be a whole number what do we do if they are none wait if they are none you can write none yeah sometimes there might be a number that is not in any of the categories wait okay i am ready is 0 a whole number
he never actually consented ms nelson i often have trouble with the whole number how do you classify it and how do you and then how to classify integer wait so integer is always positive right
right okay distribute the negative this actually acts as a grouping symbol the fraction bar so it is like there are parentheses here and then you are distributing the negative to both of those things so if that helps you remember then that would be great okay so more on rational numbers there we go okay so we have some numbers that are definitely not allowed here but i will write them here so let me just give you a couple of examples 1st
0 yeah you can do all i have not talked hey give me a you are going to get canceled hi i have not talked about stuffed animal rules enough in this class but if you want one he just has to be yours only 0 wait i forgot to do the rest of the ivanka sorry i want to be famous
the rational you have whole number well not whole numbers integers right and then whole numbers okay sounds good if a number is a whole number is it always an integer yes yes okay if a number is a rational number is it always an integer no okay what is an example of a rational number that is not an integer laura
yeah so with a variable we do not know what x is until we figure out what it is so it is like undefined not undefined more like unknown in a variable form so what would it be then it depends on what the value of the variable is so it is never really but if you do not know the value which one would it no then you just do not know you would not classify it as anything so we will not put it in the column
wait do we have any last questions on these as far as the are we feeling ready yes for tomorrow yes for your test that you are going to have no we have been studying all class today no i did not wow it is a strong word in the last 30 seconds i forgot how to do 27 -5
so for the test if you put this then for example 9 would you put it is whole integer and rational yes so you would put all 3 all of them so you have to put all the categories yes okay but could you just put whole could we do that no no you are going to lose a point no you have to because it is in other categories too yeah
i think i can i am proud of myself good for you what i thought click click click click click splash splash would come back and
so i did this in a different order in my earlier classes so this is a little bit different but that is okay i want to talk about some kind of conceptual common mistakes that i would see on some of these problems so let us go through this one by one what do you think a common mistake would be here what do you always have to remember that people forget to do steven
yeah it is supposed to be on the desk do you need anything else because actually class is going to be over in 8 seconds yes we are good you do need to be careful to not knock it over i was not okay be careful to not knock it over i will see you on
can i give it a go express yourself 0 yes please with the homework with the homework i thought that is nice that we have an hour and a half okay it did you not get or are you 6 where did you get 6
i got 152 over 99 i am not sure wait what would you get very big what i did that myself no you did not thanks for the answer i never said that no you just i did that myself can i have 2 and 3 on the board 2 and then 3
yeah no trading of in class just peer pressure sorry andrew i was never famous you want to be famous there is nothing you can do about it do not put jerry in jerry has the camera i found the camera you did not no but i found the camera earlier in class i found the camera let us leave jerry alone yeah jerry did not sign the how about you do the math problems
and so then and set up at us and she has got she got 60 you got 60 that is not appropriate that is 110 my bad how do you do that
0.5 repeated true one.2 what was it one.2 yeah one.2 ivanka i have a question yeah are variables rational numbers or irrational that is a good question so what do we think rational irrational it depends it depends anything yeah it depends on its value it could be both
0 yeah yeah i will go back yeah yeah we can be a little more detailed than that though so it is not just a fraction well a fraction because say one.6 over 2 is kind of a fraction but that is not quite enough to say that something is rational
wait are you 0 i the wrong one it is mine do you know how to do number 4 you can not are you saying because these cancel out 0 okay well that one it would have to cancel with this too so if you divide by 9 this would also have to by 9 ms nelson can you double check if number 6 is done right yeah 6 is done right this is correct what did you distribute the -6 how did she do 6 this is correct
is 0 a whole number or an integer 0 is both but it is whole so you can have it in whole yes yeah so 0 one is only a rational number but nothing else 0 one yeah that is right yeah so if it is a so if it is a fraction then it has to be rational unless it is like 0.999 right
can i speed run it speed run it yeah
i did i did do that in so it is very easy to do so let us go through these together how do you show that a number is rational yeah matthew if you can convert it to a fraction yeah so it does have to be a fraction but let us be more specific than that jc a ratio of 2 integers
that is so annoying the splashing that is not a like that i got what did you guys get little i got i got yeah but if you simplify it it is you got that
the one with jerry those 3 yes the what yes 0 wait hold on you do it less funny i am much better yeah secret if you can write secret paper on the secret paper
0 that is true i actually do not mind improper fractions if there are variables in the equation i am fine with the improper fraction because usually remember what we talked about it gets kind of messy like if you have 4.5 x this is adding and this is multiplying so i do not love that yeah caitlin distributing the x -3 like the -2 like this yeah
yeah or one or 5 you want to look at the most simplified form but you do not have to worry about it wait one it is a decimal i mean some of these i have not done this in this class but i used to talk about this in my classes so if i have say 24 over 6 what is this 4 4 which is a whole number
it is so cool cool clap your hands okay all right now you are good to do whatever you want did they have to clap 3 times or no no no no just you yeah okay wow this is so odd i do not know you can not see this but this means that i can see myself at all times because it is recording can see yeah here let us just play with this for a 2nd sorry is this okay wow yeah am i just completely ruining academic integrity here wait wait get us another let me see my why can not we do this i want to see it
can we measure what we think so i do not know about that we can measure people is beliefs and votes
no it is not yeah it is no i know but it is easy it is like jc 0 toast i will think about it do you ever yawn when you lie not me that is so embarrassing do the easiest problems 1st
maybe one category is more open than the other so it can fit both okay wait it can fit both can you explain more for example if it is 5 it fulfills all 3 yeah so how does its placement in the venn diagram tell you that it is in all 3 categories 0 yeah go ahead
yeah i might consider are you okay with writing a common denominator for we got 9 number one okay that is 11 okay do you still remember how to do them i can take a stab at it i do not really know how okay let me know when you are yes even no but wait i got it wrong i got 9 x is supposed to be greater than yeah 9 you are supposed to flip this it is literally 9 is in the brackets right yeah so that stays in the bracket
no integers can be both +and negative whole numbers are only positive so think about counting numbers in 0 so one 2 3 4 etc so is this a whole number yes yes because eventually if you count out for long enough you would get there and then the negative version of this is an integer and this is an integer do you remember the venn diagram that we had so what is inside is rational outside is rational outside is rational yes
votes yeah okay votes is votes a unit no yeah yeah you think votes it a unit anything can be a unit anything okay anything can be a unit but remember unit do we know what units stand for what is the full thing because unit is actually a shortened version units of measurement measurement yeah is this a unit of measurement yes
yeah i can not just try and recognize the sound
we are good so can someone explain no irrational but okay and refocusing up here i know today is just too fun so how does this venn diagram work so based on the placement of a number how can you tell not only the one number group that something is in but the several number groups that something is in matthew
yeah yeah yeah no no no we are going to do the dog one no we did that 0 it is 3 weeks no the sweets one is not the same guy so it is not going to be as fun we are going to do the dog one okay so stand up in your own space hold on torge can you close the door you said my name
you said but they started counting down yeah and that is confusing thank you a bob he keeps saying bob when you were talking and he was just like bob bob bob interesting all right i heard the conversation lull how can we figure this out without just saying it is a right angle how do we know zora
ooh love that we are going to say move so we talked about transformations right it means to change and it means to move but we talked about 3 specific kinds of movement 3 specific kinds of movement turn and talk to your partners figure out what all 3 are what are the 3 types of transformations turn and talk to your partners turn and talk to your partners 0 logan i do not like that i do not like that they have to come and talk to these people right here right you are the group right here
it should it should definitely all right yours looks a little bit like it i thank you no you cannot all right thank you ladies 3 voices are off can i take this off yes please all right so here is what i want us to do we are going to try let me see what time it is what time we got anyone it is 2 9
no my friend we just came from lunch no i have not
yes zora all right my friends please turn do you have a question huh no it is good
all right 2 minutes 2 minutes you should be also collaborating with your group torge she was next in line she is next in line amari you are after her but we might be out of time
i did i wanted to say that if you just drew a line where that it ultimately became a complementary angle
all right i love that i see people turning the page all right we are going to keep it going i am going to do one or we are going to do one together can you hold the question for a moment 0 yeah
rotation beautiful what is our last one that we got i think most people have spoken but i am going to call my friend perry what is the last one perry translation
all right i got to go tristan 1st all right my friends i am going to call in one person and you are going to share with us one you are going to share one all right let us see who we got here let us go eli what is one reflection reflection what is another one logan rotation
i wonder what is this grid used for and why is it being used why is it being used hold on can you say the 1st part for me what is this grid used for what is this i am just going to say what is this for what was the 2nd part why is it used why i am going to say why is it used awesome why is it used kenyatta are there any angles in there
you are test subjects we are the test subjects well really i am the primary focus yeah we are all test subjects it is really how well you guys make me look good remember that is the most important thing no it aint ourselves look good there we go if you make me look good i look good too all right no no only when i make myself look good do you think your actions are making you look good right now no
jayden take a seat we are not talking perfect that is my computer
go check on the thing come what you need amari is supposed to go get it amari go get our laptop hey guys screaming stop being loud not polite number 14 what you need
90 90 degrees 90 degrees how do we know that that is 90 degrees i want you to tell me without saying because it is a right angle how can we figure that out without doing that talk to your partner quick 10 seconds someone next to you how can we figure that out it is more in common
he tells me thank you eli what he just told me to hurry up no or it is the last 10 anyway 0 no it is not sorry i am not mathing correct today you got about 3 sh can you take your headphones off
i am not going to repeat it all right our friend professor logan is going to show us okay so what i did was go diagonally down one to the right and then went up to the right ooh did anyone else do it that way who did it ariani is way all right awesome who did it logan is way nice job i had it a different way
hey my friends what do you need 10 10 16 18 my friends we should be doing this silently we have about 34 minutes log in focus
you got to connect these connect them for me 0 i am hearing talking so i am assuming that we are done so when we are done i want you to put a peace sign over your eye like this if you notice i popped a little hip done with all 4 no just done with number 2
well i know if i have a square all squares do the same thing and i can just draw a square in each corner of the 360 ooh draw a square until we go to 360 but how does that help us because if you know you got this you got it
i get the ticket and then i will answer here what are these okay do this 1st do that 1st please and then i will talk to you about i will inspect these and then come back to you you are just carrying our pieces to a card game no
huh it is not should i do it again wait never mind i got it it is kind of like what i will do it one more time why do you move it over the amount of times you move it that is a good question can i answer it yeah you could answer it you move it to the right 6 times so that the a will line up with the a in the figure and so you just move it up so this is what you are doing and then you got to add up just move it up
are there any angles are there any angles here perhaps perhaps we might see some paige why is it called an isometric grid
one more minute so i should see things being traced being translated i did i am done
torge likes to just using the sticky note method and i said a right angle is half of a straight angle so that would be a way to measure it ooh i love that the sticky note method awesome okay collaboration over here with this group we love that all right we have another one to add on yeah i said that it is a 90 degree angle if when you draw that little square right there makes a full complete square there we go okay love that okay did you want to add on kenyatta
0 okay so how about we not let us pause there because see i do not like that i had to pause because i really love what torge just said okay we are not going to throw things okay and we are not going to rip up things okay sound good deal deal deal because if you are ripping up that paper you need it later i needed it of course you need it more all right so i really love what torge said does anyone else have something they want to add on paige
absolutely 0 you want to add okay i will take one more zora the triangles are rotated and reflected to make different patterns and shapes
i think that is a ooh we might see some ooh okay vocabulary we might see some vertical angles here absolutely let us see this angle which one is this vertical angle tell me where my hand should go yeah it is a vertical angle across across right here yes
i can not let you go because it is a
well 1st you go this way this way 0 you are going through the grid you can do what you did okay 123 all right did can i do it did anyone do it a different way i did it a different way i did it a different way 0 thank you ariani professor logan is going to show zora i saw that what it was my
you do not need to write anything right we are actually performing the translation where did you steal that from it is from me i bought it 0 really i bought it with my money with my grown up money i am getting $5 tomorrow so let us $5 hold on 12nd friend i got to see what we got here
you already know shut up sh kind words all right thank you she has been doing that all day sh 0 we are looking at professor veronica 0 it actually works all right show us what you did okay so 1st i just did this 0 what could we do so that if you were telling somebody if you were telling somebody this is how you needed to translate it what could you tell us i went diagonally up
i am still younger than your mother i told my mom is younger than you period scorpio i am hoping that i could not be any of your mothers all right again peace sign of your eyes thank you zora thank you paige thank you i love thank you jett thank you i was doing it but i have to pick my i know that is all right all right check your work with your partners check your work with your partners i can not draw see
you just got to try your best veronica will you come on the board and show us with this one just how you moved it just wait a 2nd i am going to let veronica do it i mean i appreciate you it looks like you want to 0 wait can i do it
that is fine you still have some time you have some time amari come back amari thank you you do not need your backpack for the bathroom
to place it somewhere else to place it somewhere else how could we describe it what type of move does that what kind of movement is it yeah you have to move it without rotating it moving it without rotating it absolutely yeah paige wait does say translation
not for right now i like having you in the front yeah transformation rotation yeah it is okay
hold on peel your eyes where would i put my phone who guessed right there i stole it i saw it 1st voices off 32 voices off 21 2 32 0
here you go i am going to call on you because it looks like you are on something else than us so i am going to call on you just so you know so i would maybe collaborate with your friends around there so you know what we are talking about we already talked you already talked yes so he is ready no he should be ready all right he should be
okay cha cha slide or would you rather cha cha slide would you rather i need to see everyone is fingers because we are voting that is fine that is equitable all right i am sorry i will try to find a would you rather we have not done yet they make them all the time that guy does it all the time
because it is less than an acute angle no it is more than an acute angle but less than an obtuse angle ooh okay it is more than an acute angle but less than and also also also 0 okay you could make a box in the corner ooh okay we could make a box and then we would know anyone else have a different method torge

yeah absolutely we could do 360 divided by 6 and what do we get when we divide it by 60 hold on share with your partner quick 10 seconds and then we are going to share it out on the count of 3 okay ready 123 60

torge it is not that serious all right ready did we do the dog one no they just posted that 5 hours ago 0 then we have not done it jose they posted this 15 hours ago i was 5 hours ago on youtube i saw that no you 0 that is would you rather i do not know that one
do not do it again i saw it and i will write it down in the dean is list and i will call a parent just like i am going to do for the people that push each other in the hallway we are not putting hands on each other because if she actually would have fell zora and hit her head on these desks it is not worth it what was i talking about
no if you are you should get to class on time so you can be a 0 remain silent we have friends who are still working zora jayden i see the both of you torge yes silent
2 interesting interesting i mean you move the 10 so you go over 2 up one over which way to the left to the right 0 okay beautiful so yours is going to look kind of like this does yours look like this show me yes show me no it should
where is your tracing paper yeah right there use the tracing paper that will help hold on 12nd what is up i can not send you to the cafeteria it is in rotation too it is telling us what it is a rotation you are not writing you are doing exactly what we just did
wonders or notice notice let us do a notice i noticed that there was a lot of triangles lots of triangles some might even say too many triangles i do not know depending on what shape you like logan i noticed that the triangles keep making a pattern over and over and over and over and over and over and
all right i am going to call on my friend diego and i am going to call on logan afterwards in case logan has something to add on diego how could we figure out what each of these angles measure as you could divide 360 by 60 why could we do that because there is 6 different angles and all of them they are all the same
i have 2 questions okay hold on i will be there let me put a timer on and then i will come and answer your questions hold on 12nd check your work yours kind of rotated a little see how this is still slanted and this is now in line you rotated it a little too much i do not understand i do not know how to draw
i do not know he just returned the spanish version he was not participating so yeah no do you want them no i am good thank you diego thank you perry i just i just
no because we were watching in the last class and then when you are done clean up and then return to your seat silently ooh sh silent which of these triangles are translations you will tell us
all right thank you okay my friends 3 voices off 21 it is exit ticket time listen closely already it is right math is so fun today that time just went by so fast it was not it was not

25 jayden no it is the last 10 what you need jayden what you need what number do you need okay go sit down jayden is going to bring you look over the instructions
yes the would you rathers okay we will do that can we do the cha cha slide do you guys want to do the cha cha slide okay okay okay we are doing a vote we are doing a vote voices off 30 hold on i still see computers out though so your option is cha cha slide put up a one for cha cha slide you know the cha cha slide jose yes
if your mom did not bring tylenol or anything here so the nurse can do nothing for your headache if you want to put your head down that is fine i can not send you to the nurse i will text your mother and let her know that you have a headache and that it was a little hard for you to do work today because of it but i will also say hey jayden does not want to eat the school lunch and he got a headache because he did not so then maybe she can send you with a lunch tomorrow okay
and over yeah okay lots of triangles making a pattern making a pattern all right let me take one more it is going to be thank you jayden i noticed that there is lines in the zigzags that make the triangles yeah so lines and zigzags zigzags lines can i add something
so yes so for example if i were to describe to you all what to do in words i would say translate the points 6 to the right into up all right i would say just move it that does not give us enough information so what we want to do is count 1234561212
so because i know that is 90 degrees so ooh 0 hold on 12nd okay go pick it up he keeps handing that to me and
all right 0 i have someone who wants to add on okay thank you professor can i come up yes come on up 0 my god she is my assistant no teacher is assistant 0 excuse me move please excuse me all right so professor zora is narrating now all right you go 112
ooh why is it called an isometric grid i am just going to put isometric isometric all right mikayla are you raising your hand 0 i could not tell if you were doing a signal because you had very prominent a 2 like you are hailing a taxi in new york all right go on what is yours mikayla why is there triangles instead of squares
just use this one for now what else do you need yeah we get out at 2 330 2 330 just kidding you have time but still it is too loud we need to get it is my 10 i know someone else has yours
you okay you okay are you tired no no no wake up what do you need
we can use grids to carry out transformation beautiful we used today or we learned a little bit about our isometric grid and our regular coordinate plane all right so we are going to keep it moving i know some of you all already got started on the other work that we had let us see what we got here i am sorry
thank you paige and jose who have continued to remain silent the whole time as well as kenyatta kenyatta sorry it is just a natural instinct for me to do that
i can decide what kind of transformations will work to move one figure to another one beautiful hold on this word transformation what does to transform something mean we talked about this we are talking about transformations jose to change into to change into to change does someone else have one more thing they might want to add onto this anything else zora to move a figure
it is okay we have time i am putting up on the board r let me not do this so you guys can not see ooh
that is amari so let us take a little bit of a closer look at what we have here right now all right we will try to answer these 2 questions at least all right the isometric i am going to be honest i need to look up what that word actually means so we are going to pause you know what i mean no but i was thinking maybe it has to do with isosceles triangles like the
just flip it over 0 what is it telling us to do what move to translate to translate them so that a lines up with c try it yourself i am putting 2 minutes on talk to your group say how could we actually do this i do not know trace it use the tracing paper you all
you pop a hip you are going to break a hip how old do you think i am i heard you are like 29 exactly if you was born in the 90s you are 80 in my book you is 81 foot in the grave i am younger than your mother my mom is 331st of all so i am younger than your mother no no she is 32 times
