okay class today we are going to talk about volume and when we talk about volume we have to think about 3 dimensions the length the height and the width okay so we know for a fact that volume is equal to what who can tell me alan length width height length times width times height height 3 dimensions okay
i am going to pass these pages and you are going to pretend that this grid is the same as here and every square that you see here is a unit because i am not going to use any other measurement besides units because we are using a how do you call this paper
graph paper so i am passing graph paper to everyone and i am going to get some more right here so you can take whatever you need and you guys need to so i am going to show you how to graph you can keep those in your group
let us say that we have a box that is a 6 unit by 4 units by 5 units the 1st thing that i will do is find out any point right here in my grid to start so that is the how do you call the start point of any start point let us call the start point okay
so i am going to use this one right here so i am going to start right here so the length is how much or how many units 66 units so i am going to count 123456 this is the length 6 the width because remember that we are using 3 dimensions so our box is going to be 3 dimensional
starting right here how many units is the width jose 4 units 4 units so 12341234 4 now let us go to the height how many units is the height patricia 55 so everything is going to be here so it is going to be 123455 so i have the 3 dimensions in my face of 6 units by 4 units by 5 units
so the length the width and the height so i am going to make my box how i am going to make my box i am going to plot the same thing but in the same direction okay so let us think about the length the length in this line is going to be how many units diego 66 units 123456 that is my length okay and this one will be just connected right here
so i have one face of my box now we already did the length let us do the width let us continue with the width starting right here you are going to count 1234 because the width is equal 4 can you visualize that the box is coming yeah okay so that should be connected right here right so we have the front we have the bottom now let us go to the sides
from here how many units i have to count to put the height jaime 55123455 and what about from here james or jaime the height how many 5 units 12345 okay i need another height and it is right here so i just have to connect my corners
what is another word for corner do you remember vertices vertices when it is more than one when it is only one vertex vertex okay i am going to connect this and i am going to connect this can you visualize the box yes okay now let us make sure that our dimensions is the same everywhere 6 length 4 width 5 height what dimension is that one what dimension is juliana 5 what dimension is it is a length height it is a height and height is 5 let us count 12345 so this is 5
what dimension is that one daniel 4 what dimension is that 18 who can help daniel carlos the width the width and the width is 12344 daniel again what dimension is that one length length and the length is 61234566 now this dimension is what dimension luther length length height height
the one that i am tracing right now ceci length length and length is how many units 66 units so everywhere you go what about this one what dimension is that one cutting height height and height is 55 units so everywhere you go our box is it has the same dimensions
now i am going to give you i am going to give you this box and these dimensions and you are going to use your whole page your whole page to trace the box and it is going to be that box it is going to be 14 units by 9 units by 11 units
but before that if we have to apply that formula to find the volume of this box what we should what are we suppose to do so let us say volume of this box right here and we are going to say that this box is a and the one that you are going to make is b okay so for box number a what is the volume alan 6 x 4 x 5 okay volume will be 6 times 4 times 55 and how much is that only one person
how much is that luis 120 120 how did you figure it out luis i did 6 x 4 equals 24 and i did 24 x 5 equals 120 120 so the volume is 120 so let us work on this 14 units by 9 units by 11 units and just follow the steps that i did in this building this box foreign language okay foreign language i am going to ask some questions about it so you need to figure out if you are going to use the paper and landscape show me the landscape
wait yes show show to the whole class what landscape means okay what portrait means like that so you have to decide in what way you are going to do that you need to use your ruler you to connect the points mister matta use mister matta do not use any ruler but you have to use it you have to look for that point in this plane or grid plot it and then connect those points and make the box yes can we use colors you are going to use color at the end
kevin used a ruler okay kevin do you have a ruler with this you have a ruler foreign language okay
what way are you going to use landscape or portrait landscape you need to use pencil you use colors after that okay so i am going to ask the whole class again
in this box if you look at the box how many faces in this box how many faces 66 can you go over there and count it for me so the whole class will see how many faces or sides you see in the box so let us take a look at it 123456 and 6 in the back okay thank you diego and remember at the end that you need to label label your box
you see the numbers that i put right here yes so i make sure that every dimension length width and height in the box is the same so tell me how do you start this you are using the portrait so i am going to look like this okay tell me what was the 1st step you did
the length the length and how many units on the length 1414 okay so you need to label that right now you just put 14 length is equal 14 and this is what width the width so you put w and the value of the width which is 999 units
and the height 1111 so height is 11 now you have the front part and the bottom part of the box now luis can you tell me how what are you doing right here i am doing the length 1st then i am doing the width and then the height so you need to label any unit that you count there with a little period there label means also showing me this okay for every unit that you count
so for length is 14 yes now bryan what faces of the box do you have already here i already did the front i am still working on i am trying to do the top of the the top so you only need to connect those 2 right here and you will have the top part huh and so you need the bottom part and the back part of the box
huh whoever finishes 1st i want the person to go and plot those on the board and tell the class the steps that you followed to plot those points on the grid and what did you find 1st 2nd and 3rd sometimes we use strategies to beginning with the bottom or the top or the front
it does not matter you have to go by the dimensions dimensions of length width and height almost done carlos okay i think you got it carlos are you making sure that what dimension is that one the width the width okay and the width is how many units 99 how many units do you have there you have to count the points
99 okay so i see that carlos is done with the length width and height carlos you want to go over there and plot those points on the grid yes okay let me see if i have enough sometimes okay
i am going to trace a little line between because we are not going to have enough when we are going to put it here so i am going to try to be right in the middle like this to have enough we are assuming that this is even okay did anybody find out already the volume of the box
anybody find out no okay almost okay try to be as much as i can very accurate okay is that the volume okay now class carlos is going to explain carlos you can use the purple one which is dark
is that the volume yes we are not going to do now the volume that is going to be at the end let us plot let us find out your box right here so i am going to give you the maybe the point is going to be maybe right here so you do it for the whole class you doing the length so that is going to be the length you can just trace it huh exactly and make a big one right here too okay now that is the length how many units is the length
1414 right 14234567899 units good for you okay and the height is 1111 width is 9 the height is 11 okay carlos right there i can give you a hand on that okay for the height carlos our box is going to be more than that
it is going to be huge up there so we are not going to have a space for that okay so i am going to help you to finish this right here and so one just try to do the as much as you can carlos okay it is right there okay so try to connect it like that okay good for you carlos so the height is
11 units carlos we cannot go more because we are not going to have a space for that so we have the front and the bottom of our box thank you carlos now who can tell me what is the volume of that what is the volume the volume is so to get the volume we just have to multiply 14 x 9 x 11
how much is that bryan landaverde 13861386 who is agreeing with that okay how did you figure it out sir how did you figure it out how much is 14 times 9 how much is 14 times 45360 so 360 times 11 is that okay
so let us find out 14 times 9 you say it is how much 3630660 it cannot be 4 times 9 how much is 4 times 9 luis 3636 and one times 99 is 9 +31212 so 14 times 9 is a 126 and then you multiply 126 times what 1111 and that would be 6 .
821621 it is going to be 6831 so you have the same thing okay 1386 that means that means that with those 3 dimensions that box can carry 1386
13086 okay the main focus for this was what i am trying to get from you people is to learn how to identify the length the width and the height does anybody has any questions okay
all right so today we are going to work on playing a really cool game called capture fraction but the object of the game is for you to better understand numerators and denominators so the numerator on a fraction is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom and to understand what does a numerator mean and what does that do in fraction and denominator what does that mean and what does that mean in a fraction and then today we are going to continue to ask you to identify equivalent fractions who can quickly remind me what are equivalent fractions yeah equal equal so equal equivalent so fractions that are exactly the same who can quickly give me an example of a equivalent of a set of equivalent fractions yeah
2 fourths and a half 2 fourths and a half excellent so we have 24th and a half they are equivalent that means that they are the same they have the same value or they have the same shade and places and then today you are going to put them in order where you compare a fraction and you have to use a series of thinking and thinking about equivalence and relationship to tell me how to understand what is bigger than the other does that make sense okay so you are going to actually explain while you are playing the game understand what is numerator and denominator share how your strategies and how you figure out how things are equivalent and also explain how you put things in order when you compare fractions any questions on what we need to do today no all right so what i have here is 2 fractions let me erase that 1st
okay 14th and 3 fifths in it in the game then what we are going to play is figure out who is bigger which is a larger which is a bigger one okay so you have 14th and 3 fifths which fraction is bigger so what i would like you to do is turn within your team and talk about what do you think which is bigger 14th or 3 fifths okay so it is 2 see 14th 3 times 4 equals 12 okay so what does that mean shuxian what did he just do i heard a lot of numbers
i know 4 times 3 equals 121 times 5 equals 5 huh so 3 fifths is bigger 3 fifths is bigger is that do you agree that it is is that what you said okay do you agree with it yeah okay so can you tell me if there is another way that you can figure out which one is bigger 4 times okay maybe like 3 fifths is bigger how do you know
because because 3 fifths is bigger i remember yesterday you said like like yesterday you said you have like candies if you if you eat like 2 of them you save 3 of them but then 14th they they eat less yeah they eat less they eat less okay if you also add the leftover just the waffle has the bigger one just the oh okay so you are just looking at what is leftover okay that is an idea but i want to go back to to think about what amy just said so she said well you only ate one whereas you ate 3 here but are they the same for each one no so okay think about that would that be a good way to think about well this one ate one this one ate 3 is that a fair way to think about it
oh i know if you cross across the middle it will be 245 but is this one the same so for example if i were to take this one and i apologize my drawing is not very good they are not equivalent they are not equal but if this this one is it the same as much as this one no how do you know because the square one that looked like a square but that looked like a rectangle yeah big rectangle okay if you take one as 15th and you say the denominator is bigger than the it is small okay so you have 15th and then you have 14th so because you had to split more where the denominator is bigger then that is why 15th is actually smaller than 14th so knowing that how so you have to be conscious about that this one and this one are totally different okay good job
what do you guys think 14th i think 14th 14th is bigger because last time you said the bigger number the the smaller pieces you get when you eat less you get more pieces but when you eat more you get less pieces it is like the denominator it has more you eat less when the denominator is greater you eat more you only have like 2 left and when the denominator is smaller you have more left okay does everyone agree in here yeah wonderful all right so i heard some interesting way of finding out which one is greater okay so who would like to share with me 1st anthony 3 fifths is bigger how do you know 3 fifths is bigger because 4 times 3 is 12 oh so using that strategy okay
team one so anthony can you come up and show me what you mean by that you want to change it . okay so can you tell me what you did 4 times 3 is 12 and 3 times 5 is 5 like 44 equals one whole and there is 15 and then there is one there is like 2 is one and 4 and can you speak a little bit louder i do not think i can hear you
junhong do you agree with him no how so
so what does do you agree with him then yeah then tell me why you would agree with him if you were telling me that he forgot to times to multiply by 5 in here what do you think i think like you skipped me well what about someone else what do you think because what anthony did is interesting he multiplied 5 times one to make 5 and then 4 times 3 makes 12 then he said that is why 3 fifths is bigger but then he did all of this so i guess my question to you is when you did this just say this part right here you changed you totally changed the value of 14th
i do not know how 14th is equivalent to 5 fourths do you know what i mean so that is something to think about and what junhong was saying well junhong can you tell us what you were doing you were trying to do here i mean like he just did like one he just times the numerator in there but he did not times the denominator okay so he did not need to do if he times the denominator so he did not need to do this one okay so you think that he just skipped one step is that right anthony i mean he changed a step he changed the value of 14th he just like if he you had to speak a little louder if he times the denominator it would be like it would be the same denominator okay so you are looking for the same denominator
so it would be 520 and then the other one would be this and then you would see that since can you tell me that then since they have the same denominator then you can compare it oh does that make sense good job thank you all right with someone else with a different strategy how did you figure out whether or not 14th is greater than 3 fifths well there were some interesting things that were happening here oh suddenly oh i do not want to talk about it please stop do not look at me you know what since you do not want to talk about it i will bring it up okay so earlier this team were having a very interesting conversation they were talking about well what is left over
they are focusing on the left over part and they say and do you want to continue tell me what you just you said no no okay so they were saying that there is a lot more left over versus this so you have 3 fourths left over and amy how much do you have left over here 2 fifths 2 fifths and she is saying that 3 fourths is greater than 2 fifths then that means yesterday we talked about when you have left over the more you eat the less you have left huh the less you eat the more you have left right yep when we eat candies or brownies or whatever a huge slice a huge pizza so how much the more you eat the less you have left the less you eat the more you have left but then there was a conversation that you guys you both team had that was a little was quite interesting and we i feel that we should talk about it is talking about that one
some of you are saying well this one ate one and this one ate 3 so that is why this one is bigger why is why should it not be that way shuxian because the denominator is not the same the denominator is not the same what does that mean when the denominator is not the same kenny it is not cut into the same pieces it is not cutting into the same pieces excellent job so when the pieces are not the same i could have 14th of something but if i cut something into 5 pieces and i tell you that i eat all 5 of them even though my denominator is bigger but i actually ate more because i ate more pieces so you can not just rely on looking at the denominator you should also look at the numerator as well does that make sense
so there are a couple of ways of thinking about solving figure out how one is bigger than the other now junhong you mentioned that you have another strategy what strategy do you have this one do you do you want me to erase some of them it is this one oh oh yeah oh yeah remember let me out of your way
okay can you tell us what you did i did 1st i did i split the line cut the line into 4 groups and here is how big is 14th and here is how big is 13 fifths so what did you do with 3 fifths compare how long who is who is longer but how did you know that that was 3 fifths cause here here i split into 5 groups and here is the wait while junhong is fixing his who can tell me why junhong cut his the top line into 4 pieces joyce because the denominator is 4 the denominator is 4
so he knows that he needs to cut into 4 pieces and junhong is now doing i am trying to figure out what junhong is doing right now he is doing the that is okay you are right on target he is doing the p m g what is p m g
like on the mcat where it says where is p where is m okay oh okay so kenny can you tell us what you were trying to tell him i did not say no so i i guess okay so tell me how junhong would should draw it then 01 if you try to cut it in 4 to make it equal what should the 1st thing you do half cut it in half right and then how do we find 14th
half of half half of half and then half of half of half so 3 fourths right so on the bottom he is trying and it is kind of hard it is just like what i did here it is hard to see when your line is not exactly the same or my square is not exactly the same so just bear with us so we have the same thing 0 and one so how would i do this one how many parts do i need to cut it 155 because i have 3 fifths so it is 14th and we need to do 3 fifths so we can not so we know that if i do half right here okay just to keep a gauge as to where things are so i know that 15th 25th are less than half and 35th is it less or more than half more more than half
so you can kind of play with it a little bit and just try to be a little bit try to make sure that it kind of stays within the same amount of increments so 3 fifths is here so that can help you to see that 3 fifths is longer than 14th bigger than 14th does that make sense yes okay so that was really good i did not think of that myself all right so there are quite a few ways that you boys and girls can think that up to help you to figure out which is greater so you can do what anthony was doing earlier going to crisscross and that magic rule that you guys like using you can change it into common denominator that means they share the same denominator so you can compare it or you can look at like what these 2 teams were talking about look at what is left to help you to figure out which is greater or you can use a number line to help you to figure out which is greater those are all wonderful strategies
so that is what we are talking about using the equivalence and the reasoning with equivalence and relationship to help you to figure out which is greater and which is less all right any questions no okay so today you are going to play a game called capture fraction you only you need 2 decks your own deck and your partner has a deck so basically what you are going to do is kind of shuffle the card and you on your 1st do not try to pick some of you are like i am going to try to pick the biggest one well here is a small one i am going to pick one no whatever is on your top deck put it face down put it that way and then no one is trying to cheat the top card take it out your partner takes one out and then you have to see who is greater okay if you have a greater like this fraction yeah from the top this way you get to keep your partner is card okay so whoever has the most number of cards on the end wins now but then i would like you may i can we mix it ms
luis you can if you like on page 33 in unit 6 on page 33 it says finding equivalent fractions when you are there anytime that you find a fraction that is equivalent that means the same thing the same value then you write that down so for example half is equivalent to 4 eighths then you would write half equals 4 eighths so when you find another fraction set a fraction or that are equivalent then you should write it down to keep track of it now if you happen to have a card that you are equivalent then you both keep your own card okay does that make sense yes okay any question of what you need to do no yes andrew but just we will figure it out can we split it if your partner does not have his or her cards then yeah if you do not mind splitting it that would be great
yeah what if you could just put that in the deck over here at the point that is a good point if you have a card that is equivalent you know what let me see you should get a c d oh sorry if you have an equivalent card totally lost that the equivalent card so for example shuxian and i have a set of cards that are equivalent she has half i have 48 then we deal another card out whoever at the end has the greater one gets all of them oh that is right sorry my fault does that make sense so if i have half she has a half then it is equivalent then we take out the next card and if hers is mine is one whole her is 13rd then i win because one whole is bigger than 13rd okay does that make sense any time you find any card that is equivalent write it down any question of what you need to do no no okay
who can tell me what we are going to do do not all raise your hand at the same time andrew shuffle it 1st shuffle it 1st yeah good and then what yeah like someone is talking eyes on the person who is talking like you put one card and your partner put one card if you both have equivalent you keep it okay you hold on to the card and then what you write it down on your piece of paper and then you fill up another card and see whosever is bigger whoever has is bigger will get all 4 cards oh right because you have 2 cards that are equivalent and then 2 more cards that are out there all right and whoever has the most cards has more cards at the end will win now junhong and shuxian are like oh my goodness i need to write my name on all of them so but i think you kind of recognize your own handwriting i hope
but if you can quickly write your initial on your card then that is fine too that will help a little bit if you are ready let the game begin yay does tiffany get it yes okay then tiffany explain to us what you how you are doing it if it is equivalent you keep it but if it is not equivalent then you fill out the next word if it is equivalent then you hold it and then you fill out the next card oh and then you have to figure it out that was the whole point of the game then you whoever is greater than all of them does that make sense oh now make sure you have that conversation with your partner as to how do you know that is greater or less
or equivalent 18 i have the biggest one so do i keep it okay put it down so she he can look at it too
i am putting it in all right 442 yeah 36312 alex are these your cards do you do you split it i can not find mine i will give you a little what like how are you lost foreign language no show oh okay but how do you know that yours is bigger because the denominator is smaller oh smaller right and the p then the piece you got to pick up okay what does that mean it means like if you like for example if i like ate 2 so let us use this as an example since you have it right here
so 2 thirds and 4 tenths which one is bigger this 123rd why do you think so
but are your pieces the same size mine are smaller so if you look at this as one what is left over is 13rd if you take one this is 110th right so which is greater yeah so could the piece then are the pieces the same size then no no so you can not so i i do not think it would be accurate to say that this has 2 pieces and that is 4 pieces because this portion is a lot smaller i mean the size is different so imagine if i if i say to you anthony i am giving you a piece of cake this much but i gave him half of my cake he still gets one piece but it is this big so who ate more he did even though you have one piece he has one piece but look at this piece it is like this big yours is this small right
so just saying that one piece would not be a fair way to explain it because the size portion is very different so because of the denominator right so using that think about again who is greater so if you want i i think correct me if i am wrong but what i am hearing you saying that you are focusing on this part right here what is left over right because you said you ate more and i have less right because you ate 4 pieces and i ate 2 pieces so you have more and you have less okay so let us focus on what is left look at that what can you tell me 2321 think about how much do you have left 1st you have 13rd left here and 6 tenths left okay now you are really comparing 13rd and 6 tenths now right okay so tell me
how do you know which is greater why 18 over 1018 over 10 we had that concept before so you are doing the crisscross right i hate to write on your card may i write here so you are doing 13rd and 6 tenths right and then you go 3 tenths and 6 eighteenths and that is why this is bigger right that is just a way to prove it but i need you to understand it what does that mean
you can play another round did you find any equivalents one oh one oh wait oh no 0202 what do you think 16th okay so let us try it this way all right so you have 13rd left you have 46th left there is 13rd left half of something no no okay so look at 46 okay you have 610 over if you have half of a 10 what would that be 5 so that means what you have left over is more than 5 that means it is more than half in this one you have left over which is less than half then that reverse row again so if i have less left over that means i have more
and then you have more left over and that means you ate less now we did a couple of things here so let us review what we did number one we looked at what is left over we said it was 13rd over this is 6 tenths over left over any questions so far and then we i talked about well i know that 13rd is less than a half half right and 6 tenths i know half of the 10 is 5 and i have 6 of them that means i have more than half i can actually just erase it and put it right here right all right i have more than half left over so that means the portion that is left over is a lot more that means i ate less right but that is why this is bigger than that so there were a couple of things we did all together look at what is left over any relationship with half half is a landmark number we love half right we love it
then you have half and then use that to compare and then we reversed it you guys are doing like magic here all right so try that with the other cards to see if that strategy those strategies work all right or that would be a $5 challenge can you try again yeah hey deanne what is up it is hard to weigh up no we do not have any points what do you need honey i did not find any no equivalents no okay let us play again then shuffle the card and play again how are we doing over here did you guys find any equivalents yeah 16th equals to 21286th equals to 14th 86th equals to one half interesting and you know and you can prove it right see amy can you prove this one to me
i have how do you know 36th equals to 3 because 33 +3 equals to 6 so it is a half so it is equal to okay what do you because the numerator is it is a half of the so it works all the time that way yeah good explain this one to me how is 86th equivalent to one and 14th oh can i try it yeah when you are in doubt just draw it out wait up
luis we have none of this they found it it is just your luck we do not have to shuffle it again okay shuffle it okay so tell me what is happening i drew like 46th because this is the denominator excellent so but this is right in the middle so i used another 6 and then i have to color 8 pieces so this is already one whole and this is 2 over 6
one and 26th oh so in fraction what does this think of 21 and 26th right or you can think of it as 13rd right yeah so you have one whole and 26th or 13rd so this is actually not equivalent oh but you know what amy i love this yesterday you were having such a tough time and today you are like this is easy this is easy as pie this is great but we just you know what by drawing it you just proved it right so 86th is not equivalent to one and 14th when you are in doubt draw it out that is right how are you in here too bad hey i need to hear some conversation going on here people equivalent i am so sad
she could not think how to wash my small pot and the small pot can wash it with just milk i am so sad how do you know see how do you know she could not look that is why you guys are like speeding through this there is no conversation here i lost 2 so i got all of it how do i even reach one alex i love it but too much say that again i am sorry i was a little distracted she got 22 whole yeah oh i love that oh do not forget these these are yours too shuxian tell me what is happening i do not even see it
one and 14th and 5 thirds 5 thirds right aha have a seat 1st foreign language 3 times 2 equals 4 times 21 times 2 equals 8 so oh yeah okay
is there another way to think about it instead of doing that crisscross like one and 14th 14th and 2 thirds so one and one is 52 thirds now 2 thirds and 14th yeah and so 2 times one equals 22 times 2 equals 11 times 3 equals 3 say that again you are like 3 times faster than me 2 times what 2 3 times what it is like this yeah but can you just multiply the denominator and then figure out that is the answer what i do not understand why you did that can you explain that to me because the teacher taught me
foreign language so times one is 8 i know she took the same thing but i want to see another strategy foreign language foreign language okay i am thinking okay so you used common denominator huh what do you think about that do you use that too when you are finding out the answer no no what you do the crisscross and call it in yeah oh i like that way
equivalent oh sorry they were asking some help there what is up guys going good going good did you want to talk to me about something like we are one of them is the same but then and then we can did you use the strategies that you guys were talking about looking at what is left over and do all that crazy math and then figure it out because you know why anthony i am going to ask you later oh yes we have the same thing all the time all the time then you keep flipping it oh whoever is next is going to get all 6 of them what if we have like the same thing then you have the same thing how is this equivalent explain that to me
i feel like i am never here this this one is equivalent oh we are looking for equivalent oh so we are not looking for one which is greater than the last one so do we you can not just grab it you have to explain it to her why so do we have the i am just putting like 3 no you need to say take out another card and see who is bigger okay how is this the same though oh okay because you took the that card out then talk about it which one is bigger sorry he took he is taking all of them oh you really really do not know tell me what the problem is
tell me how will you go how are you going to go about to figure it out i will do it oh good all right so excuse me i am working with another group when we are done we will talk to you in the meantime why do not you you can figure out what think of all the strategies that we talked about can you use one of those to help you to figure out which one is greater oh i get it i got another one all right tell me what you are thinking i think can i write it on here oh
so you do the crisscross right yes all right tell me another one tiffany what do you think okay team one and team 2 i love that you love the game but quiet down a little bit would you no team 2 and 3 sorry 456 i love how she used the graph paper so that i can actually see it a little easier it is down there too okay about 2 more minutes boys and girls
1234567891011121314151617181920 all your big numbers are make a total of all your big numbers did you solve the problem good i am happy with my luck today okay so she is doing a number line oh yes good luck so she has 14th right here where would you put 2 sixths we have 2 eighths right here why because the denominator is less than the 4 but you have 2 of them no but i just put them right here oh sorry i asked you where 16th is did not i sorry about that
it is like playing cards it is likes playing cards okay good do you see what she did okay so she is using a number line to help her so here she tried to cut it from 4 equal parts and here she cut it in 6 equal parts 14th on the 1st line she drawed it as 14th and then one on the 6th line she cut it in 6 equal parts and then she had 2 sixths okay so can i show you another way i was thinking about it yeah i am going to use this oh think about what is left over you have half more than half right and here you have half is not it
then now you have so you can totally figure it out so they are exactly the same so what is left this and this this is 14th this is 16th so which is greater 14th so that means this part 8 more right so this must be less than that less than 8 all right all right let us return the card to the rightful owner oh oh so take your own card take your friend is card out please
i do not have i do not have 64 i only have one if you are ready eyes on me so i know you are ready thank you team one thank you . all right okay so most of us are ready so can someone share with me what was your strategy what did you do to help you figure out whether or not your card is bigger than your partner is card andrew i used 2 ways one is to put the card in one of the number lines okay so for example i think your card was 14th and 2 sixths right okay so can you come up and tell me what you did please oh wait a minute you can not sorry you can not be in the camera
sorry sorry sorry so can you just tell us what you did this close and 4 times 2 equals 8 okay and 6 times one equals 6 so i because the the 8 is bigger than 6 so that means 2 sixths is bigger excellent all right so that is one way oops thumbs up if you have tried using this strategy while you were working on figuring out who is greater who is not okay good most of you and then the other strategy the number line i got one number line and i split it into 4 equal parts okay i noticed that you were very good about putting 0 and one earlier so i want to make sure i put that there it is very important to know that and then you split it in 2
well we 1st split it into a half okay and then a half of the half is 14th okay and then the other half just put 14th so it will be 3 fourths okay and then one because it is a 14th so that is how far it is 14th and then 126th i draw another number line i split it in half and because i know one because 16th is less than 14th so i put it to be less than 14th and then i draw another 2 sixths right there next to 14th not on 14th yeah not on 14th okay
so that is and the other side i do it the same way so kind of less than 3 fourths so that would be 3 sixths it will be 4 sixths and then a little bit more than 5 sixths am i correct but given my portions are not exactly the same but it should be so and this is 2 sixths so this is how far 2 sixths is okay any questions for andrew no but again the importance of drawing your portions to try to be the same so that if i draw 14th like this but then if i i am sorry if i do 14th like this and then my 2 sixths is like this well of course 14th will be a lot longer than 2 sixths right here right so your line needs to be about the same if you can good job okay
excellent someone else with a different strategy so we have 2 strategies so we will call it the crisscross how do you spell crisscross c r 0 s s criss cross applesauce and then do we do the number line okay what did you do the times one the what times one okay do you want to come up and do it so we will use the same thing
how about that 16th and 2 sixths okay one fourth . okay who can tell me what junhong did michael what did junhong do
do one times 6 equals 64 times 4 equals 242 times 4 makes 8 so can you tell me what he is trying to do here he is drawing a line okay you are telling me what he did but can you tell me what is his strategy why is he doing that yeah but why is he doing all that work michelle to make the both denominator same oh so he is looking for the same denominator then he can compare just the numerator okay so that is one strategy to find a common denominator
so the same denominator does that make sense yeah that he can just focus on the numerator so another strategy is the common denominator good okay any questions for junhong no okay so what is anybody else with a different strategy
oh why do not the 3 of us kind of explain what we did all right so you have 14th and again the importance of trying to draw the shape the same the same the whole is about the same size so it is easier to see so well and tiffany and andrew and i we also used a similar actually the same strategy so what do we focus on when you have something like this what is another way to focus on yeah how many is left focus on the leftover portion so here i have 3 fourths left over
and here i have 4 sixths left over okay and then what okay so why one wei xin or anyone else she does not just put the 2 of them . all right anyone no okay so let us think about this one i know we are running out of time so we have 3 fourths left over this one has 4 sixths left over so we talk about the relationship with other fractions
so here i know they are going to be upset that i used green but i am going to fill this in i know this is half and this is half what is left over this is the same thing so the one thing that is different that is left is that one whole so here not one whole sorry this is 16th this is 14th left over now i can compare 14th and 16th because i took care of the half already right they both i took care of that so i do not have to worry about that because they are exactly the same then i have 16th and 14th left now because the numerator is the same then we can go back and think about well one out of 4 pieces one out of 6 pieces 14th must be bigger right now then i know that 3 fourths is bigger than 4 sixths so then we go back to that idea
the more i ate the less i have left over the less i eat the more i have left over so because i have more left over then that means that i must eat less so this must be smaller and since here i have less left over so this must be bigger does that make sense so again thinking about using the relationship you have the fractions have amongst each other bringing out the half then look at the next part does that make sense okay okay so tomorrow we will have i think we should talk a little bit about more about this strategy so another strategy is looking at the left overs i like calling them left overs they are like food so they are like left overs all right so and the relationship between one fraction to another to help us to figure things out use what you know we always say use what you know to help you solve what you do not know okay any question on this no
so tomorrow we will talk a little bit more about that we will play another probably another round of fraction cards for those of you who left your fraction cards at home please bring them back tomorrow all right any question no no the 4 strategies we talk about is crisscross you are working on the number line finding the common denominators and focusing on the left overs i think we are pretty most of us are pretty comfortable using the crisscross i think we should develop focus a little bit more on the other 3 and especially i love this one where we actually the more you are able to manipulate the numbers and the fraction the easier that means that your understanding of fraction is even deeper the number line the number line and you might find one that is most efficient for you any question no we did not get a chance to talk about the equivalent fraction so we will continue that conversation tomorrow we will start that conversation tomorrow please share it so your homework for tonight is page 35 which is larger which is larger
2 thirds or 32s use word to rehab sorry use words and picture to explain your answer earlier michelle and amy were trying to tell me something that is equivalent and then amy was like may i draw it and once they drew it out they figured out the answer so when you are in doubt draw it out okay any question on your homework no no you may put take it out put your name and date on top and put it away please
good morning everyone good morning mister jones now listen carefully listen again all right this morning we will continue exploring exploring fractions all right and fractions now remember fraction we are only revising a few things before we get into the practice we have been exploring these fractions now fabio could you tell us something about fraction when you are thinking fraction yes one half is the biggest one half is the biggest fraction that is good so we put the word biggest greatest larger bigger greater larger this is comparing so you are kind of comparing or ordering now that is one thing
another 118th is the smallest one for which one now for what we did and we are going to look at this 18th was the smallest but that is not the smallest fraction there is more fraction could go down low low low but 18th was the one we did for the set remember it is about the set so we did fraction of an area fraction of a set fraction of a group these are the things we have been working on we are going to revise a few minutes for 2 minutes that is why i have you all together here so we could look at it and explore more and go deeper and then go in the practice in your book and i will tell you what page i am going to put them on the board the page that i would like you to work with a partner when we finish some people no no no some people i already know .
and some people i already kind of know but i am going to walk around and see how do you integrate the practice we did i mean the lesson we introduced and i put a few posters up there about fraction now what do we notice in a fraction something we talked about yesterday and we talked about right somebody yeah numerator numerator and a denominator there is always and what did we learn i am going to pick on one person naila when we say can i see you still yeah when we say numerator or denominator tell me something about denominator naila naila something about denominator what does it represent what does when you see the denominator what do i have in mind
the whole process the whole thing everything everything of the fraction that means the whole area or the whole group or the whole set how many is in it is the denominator like i have 3 fractions up there i have 3 i have and then hold on i have a half and i have 58th i mean 510th and i have 244 and it is the all halves but we could tell 510th and 10 is the denominator and it is 10 it is divided it is divided into 1010 pieces 10 pieces that is the big idea all right
now i bring this part too i bring i bring this part that show you the whole the fraction how many how many in this fraction one half 2 whole see it is 2 but it is 2 halves right and then we have the whole again from 0 it is a fraction line from 0 half to one half and then 222 halves 2 halves yes 2 halves all right see all right next one if we want to divide it the whole in in let me wait for all in yep and nixon and michael and michael yes and michael so if i want to divide my .
my whole into halves or if i want to divide my whole in 4 people yeah so this is my whole this is 14th 24th which is the same as one half thank you and i have 34th which is the same as one half 1213rd yeah 14th i am going like this one half 13rd kind of close to 13rd but it is kind of well wait a minute what you said is fine it is kind of close
3 fourths is kind of almost 4 fourths almost so it is very close to 4 fourths which is the whole thing because i break it into 4 pieces and i could do the same here for 5 and if i have my whole and i go into i break my whole into 55 this is what happened so i have 15th 2 fifths 3 fifths 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 5 fifths so which is closer excuse me which is closer 334th and 45th or 34th and 35th which which one is closer 34th . which one is closer together i mean which one is kind of similar
closer together 34th could you maybe put your that is it 34th 35th 34th and 35th or 34th and 45th 34th are they almost both of 25th almost a whole yeah they kind of almost right and then we are looking into 8th that is the 8th 8th the 8th and then see 4th that is what we did half become 4th 4th become 8 which name 4th become become 8th if i want to put my whole into smaller fraction 8th right then if i want to go that same half i want to put it in 5th and that 5th i want to put it in 10th what am i doing here when i am looking right here excuse me excuse me
when i am looking right here look look look i put that 55th right here 55th and i am lining it up with the half so what are we doing the pattern equivalent thank you yeah yeah that is another word we are going to so we looking i see i look we have the vocabulary up there equivalent small group now let us look at a group we we did the group before but now we are going to go over it again before i send you into the practice in your book with the pattern all right in a minute now look at me look at me up
you may go and fix it for me please what thank you thank you thanks good job you did a good job guys can you go further up that is it thanks all right now listen may i have your attention attention again christine i need your attention the day before this is what we did and that is why we revised it on the poster when i put the poster up when i put the poster up so people are able are able to look at what we are those posters that i put up so people are kind of looking oh we did this but we are going to do it for a group all right look again look look this is .
thank you look again see this is what we did we are kind of revising it see we take the group and we you remember we had a half we put the group in half in half all right then we said half of this group we did the half this way and we did it that way also this is half again we did half that way all right we did half the 2 different ways we did it this way we did it that way and we decided we decided we call it half 2 ways half or or 121224 because we know for . equivalent the rectangle
and we also go with the equivalent all right so 12 24 is half of this fraction or this set or this group or this group let me wait for rudy yeah rudy yeah show me thank you all right next one come here all right next one we were going to 14th 14th of that half or we could decide we decided we decided 4th or 4th of that same set is is 6 is 6 pieces and it is out of the whole thing which is 24
and 14th we put it right there the equivalent of for this set which is 24 is thank you 6 yeah so 14th how many how many of this how many 4th is of half yeah 66 but another word for this 4th is what half half of what half of the half of the half half of the half is 6 half of the half is 14th that is what we were looking into again and let us continue what is this here look at this anybody anybody anybody you need to raise raise your hand please
let me go into luji luji what is this here can you read this fraction only luji thank you thanks for your help we are looking into this fraction here we can leave this one which is 14th now how many 4th of this one luji how many 4th wait a minute 12 34th 34th 34th is this 14th 24th 34th oh i could do it this way 14th 24th 34th oh and what do i have here that is shaded 34th 34th and that this is not 24th but this is 34th 34th of the whole set is shaded and that 34th oh i put it right here
i had it right here that 34th is how many
this was 6 but i have 3 of these how many is it 81219 she is not even looking you are not even looking up there 3 look look look look some people are not looking let me see those that are i know if ludi was looking she would be the 1st one telling me if you were paying attention and i am looking for your attention samantha where are you naila chrislene chrislene can you yeah thank you now chrislene i have 14th here which is 624 now 34th must be how many pieces chrislene 4 yeah now i have your back 34th must be how many pieces luji luji look up there
i have 14th look 14th is 6 pieces of the whole set 34th must be how many pieces 3 thank you 34th is how many of the whole set 1818 oh my god
yes well okay but they did not get it but they did not get it i need them to get it too see you were able to get it but some wait a minute ludi ludi yes your attention is on me all right so next one yes camille the question is for you now look at me what i have done yes if anybody want to help camille they can raise their hand now what am i doing i am going down i am going down so the fraction is going one half 14th and this one become 13 excuse me yeah of the whole set the whole set the whole set
what do i read this fraction it is half of 14th it is 3 pieces you people are not really paying attention the same word odd numbers but they are not really looking like dolly is not really yeah okay with jimmy i know it is one and 18th 18th who said that me oh samantha is really there because we have done this before we are revising yes all right now excuse me now somebody now i have naila back now naila can you explain why do we call this 18th yeah why do we call this 18th because . look at this one and look at this one why do we call this 18th okay
why do we call this 18th oh somebody is ready naila can you explain yes sir yes with . thank you so 3 and . that is why we call it another name an equivalent of this one excuse me
so it is 324324 which is equivalent to 18th for this set 18th 18th okay now listen i am going to erase this and i need people is attention because i am going to ask you another question we never talked about before yes we have 13rd we have 13rd i mean we have one half we have 14th
look at me oh yeah that same set and how many is in this set 24 so we know 3 pieces is how many what fraction 3 pieces 3 pieces is what fraction 18th 18th of the whole set and that is 324 do we make it clean thank you thank you very much it is hard to it is hard to keep it up next one listen what did we learn no wakudowali let us go wakudowali right michael what else did we learn we learned 18th let us go back we are revising a little bit let us go back one more fraction we learned with the whole set
the whole set
chrislene wow okay half we will put one half and one half must be this way 1224 okay oh that one half is 1224 right another fraction we learned for the set now i have you back okay yes 14th and we put them in order and that 14th must be okay all right so that is what what do we call it what is the equivalent
624th 624th i have you back 624th now listen this is a new question and people need to think people need to think this is my sandwich half of my sandwich is 12 pieces out of 20 24 that is half of my sandwich remember we said this is considered as a sandwich that i am eating now 14th if i decide to eat a 4th of my sandwich it would be 6 pieces out of 24 now if i decide to eat 13rd 13rd of my sandwich how many pieces would that be you need to think and i am letting people think hm
and i am letting people think and then i will say you know hold on excuse me we said 14th is 6 pieces out of 24 and we put it here right one half is 12 pieces out of 24 and we could see half half of half is 4th half of 4th is 8 because of the number right now i am asking you a question and i am going to give you a chance to talk talk to your friend and say i want 13rd of my 13rd of my 8 pieces all right excuse me
13rd of my 24 pieces you could talk to your friend for a minute yeah 3 friends are talking 3 are talking good job let me see let me see yeah good rudy is talking over there i am looking for 13rd i want to eat 13rd how many pieces would that be good job how many pieces well jamie you may talk to anyone yeah talk to someone naila yeah whistling you may get into that talking yeah you may listen to them listen what they are saying when i raise my hand i am going to raise my hand in a minute 13rd how many pieces 13rd yeah a 3rd of my sandwich i am eating only a 3rd how many pieces would that be
13rd no sorry 4 okay back let us get back 8 good job i am back back no no no no let them let them 212 somebody somebody is waiting i am nixon collins collins darlene good job now listen i am going to ask one person and if it is if you find that same answer do not tell me what to do please all right now if it is listen i am going to show you one thing darlene now if it is the same answer we got to that person what do we do leave it out there yes
yes all right now rudy i am always calling your name and i know you very yes yes all right now what was the answer how many how many pieces would it be in what fraction numerator and denominator now let me wait for camille camille how many pieces we said 13rd of this set how many pieces might it be oh one some people are not listening some people were not listening i heard some people were talking excuse me nixon do not do that thank you get up nixon
so i hear 3 people were talking and i heard the answer kind of but i was not sure right nixon what did you talk me about i said we said we said we talked about yeah we talked about listen listen girls girls yeah we said 12 over 24 is half yes yeah and then we are going to see the 13rd yeah 13rd must be 13rd must be 13rd of this set must be 13rd i am going to find this and i okay that is what you talked about right yeah now let me go to another group okay let me go to another group excuse me now you need to listen
if it is your answer you need to go yes but if it is not then you need to say oh how oh how hold on dolly dolly listen listen to another group thank you
now listen to me listen we are looking for how many pieces would be 13rd how many pieces would be 13rd 18th why do you say 18th we already know 18th is 3 pieces oh 6 it is 3 pieces 123 and we know 15th is 6 pieces now we are looking for 13rd oh wow and using the same strategy now listen michael yes michael calm down all right listen why is 18th somebody was telling me yesterday me 8 times 3 is 2424 hold on i said 24 i remember it was you that is okay all right so 8 x 3 is 24 very good hold on
i am showing you something very important 4 times 6 is 24 and that is why we see oh this is 14th we transfer what we have learned before into the fraction all right another 12 times 12 is 24 and that is how we know half is 24 now can we use that strategy to get 13rd maybe what can we do to get 13rd what can we time 3 times 83 times equal 24 that tells us how many pieces 8 pieces not 18th 8 pieces that is what i asked you how many pieces would be 13rd hold on you said .
i heard you were saying that but you missed kind of you go with 18th 18th is something different to a fraction you know what listen i am trying to kind of help you understand the way you said it and the way you told me is different so 13rd must be let me see 123456785678 so let us see look at that look look look before we go into our book so this is what we call 13rd and how many pieces is that 8 good 53rd so now how many 8 look she is not looking she is not looking she is thank you
yes so 18th 18th 18th how many 8th how many 8th how many 8th 6 you are not looking see 18th 18th 18th how many 8th 33 times 824 so the fraction for 18th another way an equivalent fraction would be is it 324 or 824824 because it is 8 pieces we call it 320 328 how many pieces 328 no but if i have the whole thing is 24 aha 3 look look we said 13rd is 624 so this one must be how many pieces
888 pieces so 824 is the same equivalent to 324 is the same equivalent to 13rd of this set thank you yep all right yes now any questions let me see people that has questions regarding regarding regarding the fraction of this set fraction of this set now if i have 16th i mean 13rd 13rd becomes 16th because half of 3 is 6 so 16th how many pieces would that be the smart people let me call see the smart people excuse me
16th 13rd is 8 pieces so 82416th must be 4424 oh you all getting it 424 do you see now i get you back yeah you get me back yeah i get you back yes right see so this one is equal same thing as 4 24 because 4 times 6 is 24 now i get you luji do i really get you back yes you get this piece yes when i say 16th must be because 13rd is 824 so if i go 16th must be e times e
see what we are doing we are matching facts time factors equals factors equal product we are kind of combining a lot of the learning we have done before
no the whole area the denominator i see some people are not paying attention so what i am going to do and i will go to 13rd 16th and one 18th 112th no 14th 112th 118th oh yes why do you say 112th if i am going down 13rd 16th 112th what would it be 14th no wait a minute this is what we had 84th yeah she gets it it becomes 2 if i go 112th equals 2 2 oops
sorry 224th 124th 124th 124th is what one 148th 148th okay now you get it now yes good job i like that all right now another one and then we will go into our book yes yeah and practice and practice now remember we went into a different different set we went into a different set we went into 13rd for this set one 23rd for this set people that are looking with me 13rd see 13rd of this set let me see 13rd let me make it 13rd some people those guys on my left are good are good are smart are smart i get it
i am getting smarter every day i am always smart i am always smart you are getting me back getting me back fine now listen carefully listen we have a different different set which is we were looking for 13rd how many in this set 313rd wait a minute let me see this one tells us how many in our set thank you it is an area
we did that the day before or yesterday so 13rd must be so it is 13rd is so i have it into 3 yes now i see some people are looking some people are talking and some people see those people that are talking they will not be able to do what we are going to have them do is all right hold on hold on let us wait for the talking so i can do a little bit of it and guide it to chrisline my favorite naila good job all right so 13rd see this is a 3rd another 3rd
so 2 thirds must be how many pieces 20 thank you very much 161620 pieces equals 16 yeah what am i saying i said you got me back okay see and i have 13rd +13rd equals 40404040 hold on that is right 13rd +13rd equals 2 and 2 thirds of the whole set of the whole piece of the whole set of the whole piece or of the whole area
you are getting me back hold on let us wait for these guys okay and they call themselves the smartest you got back me thank you now listen 13rd 23rd can i have 16th yeah 16th yes
see if you start shouting it is not good see now he is talking 16th now see we have 13rd if we are looking for 16th 16th must be wow see some people oh now they are getting smarter let me see if they are talking together chrisline luji and naila and we need people 5 there can not be you know 16th 16th there has to be 15th 16th if we have 13rd we could have 16th yeah i know yeah so how many pieces would that be that 16th must be how many 2 remember look in here that is 13rd 13rd 16th must be what
23rd 13rd 13rd you know if you shout if you are talking then it is not my thing i am not kidding i am not kidding why because you are talking see they do not they did not hear now how many people agree with this group over here all right look look what did they say 16 must be must be what 110 he said 110 no that is what it was 10 faces and we say 106 and 10
equals 6 and let me see 246 hey come back you got me back you you got me back i got you back you got me back i got you back yeah i got you back all right so listen listen listen how many 10s are in here 1110 look look 1101102 no how many 6 are in here 2616162636 let me see 46 this is oh
16 and that is that is 2 that is 22636263646 am i halfway listen am i oh i cannot tolerate the way you turn around while we are doing it no you are talking to someone else no look at him no am i halfway here yeah so 36 must be .
368368 is the same equivalent yes and then we go oh no no no no no am i right look look 16th 26th 36th 46th 46th 76th 56th 106th 6th 76th 56th 106th 6th 66th oh 60 over . oh 6060th all right now wow we learn a lot now we learn a lot oh marco you know how to do it no no no no no no you leave it you leave it you leave it did i say no leave it leave it leave it guys
leave it leave it guys let me see people who are paying attention to me my student my learners hold on sit down sit down sit down my friend virginie you are not listening to me virginie michael michael michael michael you are not listening what direction 1st you need listen let us see cludy good job darlene thank you leave it leave it because we need this darlene you are not sitting and listen what direction now michael is not listening i am losing you see i am losing them yes that is the way all right listen all right thank you good job now that is how i need it
now i am going to have these 3 people you listen to what you are going to do god bless now see you will not give me a chance see people are not really listening . thank you kristen thank you now we are going to go into your your book your book and in that book i want you to work i want you to work on page page one huh listen i will tell you which page
page 13 i am going to put them on the board page 1356 and maybe we will get a chance to do a few problems and the problems are on page 79 and 10 but we will do about 3 okay all right 5 and 6 and 6 all right so i am going to let you work for 10 minutes on this one because some people already did a few of them yeah some people you need 6 that is the one and some people already did a few they understood but now i know they are going to kind of be now listen i am going to have people go back to their seat but not everybody all right michael you may go back gerland gerland you may work with michael if you want to but if you all right now i am going to walk around and see i got it all right i know
all right rudy you are going back to your seat and i am going to send you someone to work with you excuse me now you stay in your seat wait in your seat wegeni in your seat please page one page one page one we are going to omit page one page one we are going to omit what is that page one what does it mean omit omit means leave it leave page one yeah because we have done that before we have done page one you did page one we did page one so we are not going to do page one oh wait a minute we did page one excuse me you did page one so i want you to go on to page hold on
he is not listening page half of a rectangle which page page 5 okay 5 page 5 all right yeah page 5 yeah page 5 all right hold on now let us see some people page 5 page 5 yes 6 now let us look at page 5 page 5 together
and some people have done it and it is easy right yes page 55 good job now let us go into page 5 nixon number one please one page 5 fabio fabio 55 unit 6 page 5 good job see he is not on that in that unit page 5 unit 6 okay wegeni number 2 please wegeni what fraction is that 14th what is your name wegeni no number one no wegeni what fraction on page 5 number 2 is what fraction what do we call it what fraction is shady 66 wow
some people are really not listening that is the thing i know some people can not even look at it and read it what do we look how many what is the denominator the whole thing the whole thing how many pieces can you look at how many pieces denominator no it is number 2 yeah how many pieces 14th so the denominator is 8 so how many is shady 18th 18th yes all right now let us look at another person that is really good at it somebody now i see hands up good job hands up
christlene hands up
my my learners are bad you are messing it up now chris you did so well in this now let let me go into one of the problems on page 9 oh no no let us go oh yeah page 6 is one of the problems that i feel dolly could help with one of the problems dolly okay now it says listen let us see people who are looking at one of the problems on page 6 she is on page 6 on page 6665 do not make 6 michael 6 yes yes good job weginie 6 very good how about christine 6
all right he is going to read the problem for us ethan has 24 marbles thank you that is his set that is the set we are talking about i am done he gives 28 of his collection to his sister ruby how many marbles does ruby get see the question is always they give you the set and they give you the fraction and they ask you how many pieces that is what i have been asking you now i want people and i am going to walk around and see people who think of this set is 24 and how many pieces let me walk around see people and i see some people are drawing the 24 just like we did it here oh they just know oh 24 let me see
let me see the fraction fraction show it yeah how many 28 what did we do when what did we do when we need to find the fraction of a set remember what we just did she is trying and the set has 24 how did we use can we use this that is why i needed you to keep it up see i said keep it up all right so that is why i needed you to keep it up remember what we did here okay so let us go back to the set of 24 all right hold on
look look look in here can i go to the bathroom okay all right hold on hold on we we i have a pencil for people that need to borrow a pencil but listen can i am going to see if this one can help you fabio fabio what we did here we had 24 we had half we had 14th and we had excuse me 18th 18th 18th you are not looking you are not looking see i will get you back all right see 18th and 28th what do you think 28th might be i will take it back that is okay what do you think 28th might be 6
2 would be the so 28th might be the same 6 over 24 how do you know that because because if i know 18th is 328th might be another 3 it might be 666 so now you got me back 3 +3 is 6 i get you yes so 18th is 324 so 28th must be 624 so 28th might be might be 28th might be 624 624 and do i have 6 up here no you have 3 so 28th is the same as as 28th is the same as .
look at this 2 look at this 2 some people are not looking they do not get it she is not getting it see we did it up here we said i knew it 28th must be another 18th 18th +18th equal 28th and then 18th and when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see it is only one no no wait a minute what do i see when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see people are not looking 8 yeah 14th and 28th what do i see the same amount the same amount so what do we call 28th and 14th is equal equavalent thank you very much equal so do you see the number how many pieces 24 now what do we write down for the problem
ruby gets ruby gets ruby gets marbles ruby gets 6 marbles 6 marbles do you write a sentence let me see if people write a sentence yeah the sentence is how many marbles does ruby get 6 ruby gets 6 marbles no that is a u marbles ruby let me see ruby ruby gets 6 marbles do you write it down ruby gets ruby gets 6 marbles ruby gets i like when people put the s ruby gets if you know you can do the 2nd one oh yeah yeah you could use the equation you do the 2nd one those who know because we are about to finish and then i will let you go back
not today but tomorrow oh my god the floor is half of half the book like was and 3 i will know it thank you thank you i know whenever she gets it she explains it i will get you back i will get her back so now look at that she is doing number 2 so if you are doing number 2 let me see because we are about to finish and we did a set we did a problem and then we will continue doing those kind of problems with 24 sets good job quick we are doing the 2nd one number 2 number 2 and then we are about to finish and say what did we learn i learned all right hold on no we know it somebody already do number 2 some people already do number 2 ruby gets how many pieces were you looking when i .
yeah yeah how many pieces did ruby get 66 all right now do the 2nd one let us see you do the 2nd one see people who do the 2nd one quick later on i have for you he is thinking but too loud now let us see he is working she is working she is thinking he is doing he is already done maybe he is not good maybe open it and check it check it out yes
so do you write a sentence did you write it ah i am glad i told you see okay you are all ready 24 wait a minute 34th 34th of 24 remember we learned about 34th of 20 oh 34th of 24 must be must be 24 remember we did all that 35 by 3 we did half look look look people that are looking yes i am glad you are looking see that is 14th that is 24th how many pieces that is half 24th is half and 34th 34th is how many 34th is how many
how many pieces 8 pieces wait a minute 14th 24th 34th 18 pieces 18 pieces yes yes oh good we did that before i do not know why you you said it good job girls i have said it yes did you guys see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see collection i know how many ethan oh yeah sentence she gives okay mister jones got me back got me back the sentence sentence you write the sentence ethan gets 18 toys toys thank you very much what do you write down
i wrote a rubric he said rubric gets 8 cards he said he can get 18 cards open it so we can see it we will we will let you do more problems yeah we will let you do more problems somebody ask him one more one more hold on hold on let me let me stop for a minute look at the ends 2 thank you now i am going to ask a simple question a simple question to dolly dolly yeah give me your give me give me your attention do i have you back chrislene do i have you back yes yes michael i have your back fabio i have your back yes okay
all right see he he is talking if i have you back then you are listening not talking nice now orleans yeah give me one thing we learned during this time of math this morning what did we learn remember what we were you know remember our objective for the for the week for the week for the week all right remember this one here finding sit down finding
student will be able to find fraction part of a group or any area in the num meaning of numerator and denominator thank you very much now i see michael warren really listening yes maybe he could tell me one thing now one thing one thing one thing if you are ready to say one thing that we learned this morning that you feel strong and i could explain it i could write it in my learner is notebook and i could take it home with me it could be any of these it could be any of 24 it could be something but all right all right it could be out of a set it could be any fraction anything right
now one thing today and tomorrow i learned about it oh some people are not listening somebody is sharing some people are not danny is not listening michael is not listening and abigail is not listening oh yeah we are about to finish thank you we are about to finish our lesson and then we need somebody who can tell us a few things we learned simple oh now let us 12 yeah go ahead today i learned the fraction of a set and i learned that danny danny danny is the whole set of a fraction thank you very much that is one thing
one fact about fractions what we learn the denominator is the whole set number or the number in the set all right now can i i will come to you because i know you have something nice but i do not know if luji luji if you are going to write home about math tomorrow i am going to read it in your book good job yeah what is it what would you tell your mom or dad about what we learned today see he is not listening thank you yes
so yes so yes james i heard that a set of fractions could be divided into many sets of pieces thank you we also learned no hold on one fact a set of fractions could be learned into many pieces many pieces many pieces and you could tell the fraction but the fraction pieces see you are not really listening alright next one dolly dolly dolly just a minute dolly yes yeah okay go ahead now today i learnt that no say it louder today we learn how to add fractions add
half +one half but what of a set it could be a set one half of a set +one half of a set is equal to the whole thing how about a word equ equivalent equal anybody pick up anything what is equal what fraction is equivalent equivalent equal she does not know see will i am losing you will now tell me something about equal equivalent yeah okay wait yeah nixon nixon do not talk to him
yeah let us go ignore yeah 7 half 7 half 7 14 is a equal is equal to equal to half equal to something now anything about equal equal equal equivalent she said 7 14 is equivalent to half i got one i got one 7 14 is equivalent to half one half is i mean 12 over 24 12 over 24 is equivalent to a half thank you oh oh 6 over 12 is equal to half half and 13rd is equivalent to
hold on hold on let us finish with half now 13rd 13rd is equivalent to equivalent 262613rd is equivalent to 262 pieces out of 6 pieces we have got your back all right i have got your back all right now listen carefully listen listen for those of you that were paying attention and i know those people who they are they are ready to do more problems she already told me she said oh i can do this can i do more now i am going to give you about one minute 2 no wait a minute one minute to work on the problem but this is the end of our lesson for today but tomorrow we will go in the book and just work in the problem and see people who really are similar all right yes yeah
okay on your desk you should have your math journal scissors glue and a pencil anything else on your desk you need to take it off so it is not in the way water bottles put them on the floor put them on the floor caleb please come sit here come sit here oh my god maddie why do not you sit here
okay we are going to practice modeling multiplying and dividing decimals by another decimal so i am going to give you graph paper you do not need it quite yet just kind of put it to the side you will fill in in a minute take out some colored pencils also i forgot to tell you to do that i would rather you not do markers crayons or colored pencils are good okay just put them on the back counter for right now we will give it back when he comes in here okay okay
where is my little clicker all right so on your math journal write how do you model a multiplication of a decimal by another decimal that is your essential question how do you model everybody needs to have their question down question is on the board ryan you are putting in front of how do you model multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
there is your question just forming that phrase into a question
okay you should be close to being done so that i can switch the screen okay pencils are down when you are done so i know i can move on okay tell me how multiplying a decimal by a decimal will be similar to money what can you tell me caleb because money is a decimal or a fraction of a dollar okay because quarters or are those dimes these are dimes so how would i a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths okay so a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths which is ¢10 right
yes okay okay so how would my what would my multiplication problem look like to show this answer what would i write a 10th times a 10th because i have how many dimes 1010 so what is my answer one whole one whole which is a dollar okay good alright look at this one how would i write write the multiplication problem for this on your paper
what would it look like to model a decimal using money okay okay what is my number of cents going to be shane 110th times 5 times 5 which is going to equal what ¢50 $0.504 times decimals it is 50 what 100s good okay do this one show that number of cents with quarters
those are quarters caleb now is not the time
okay make sure you have a number of cents i just do not want to see the answer i want to see the number of cents so what is my number of cents ryan 25 hundredths . huh 5 good 25 hundredths times 3 equals 75 hundredths 75 hundredths okay now we are going to look at a decimal by a decimal so i want you on the graph paper that i gave you i want you to show me the model
give me a decimal ryan 52 hundredths 52 hundredths yeah okay so you are going to show 52 hundredths times give me a number elika 33 tenths yes okay so 52 we can not do 52 though we have to do 50 for right now we are not there yet 50 hundredths times 3 tenths so model that on your paper use the graph do not worry about where it says decimal fraction simplified that is for another activity we are just interested in the hundredths chart you can use crayons you can use colored pencils
you are going to model it you are modeling it you are showing me the answer using your model so 50 hundredths times 3 tenths what would that look like as a model 50 hundredths what is 50 hundredths show me 50 hundredths on your model here what does 110th look like okay so what does 5 tenths look like
so you should be shading in blue and yellow works best why does blue and yellow work best because you can see the color you can see the color change and the color change is what you do not have to use those colors i am just telling you it is easier to see i like the way sawyer is turned out these need to stay there okay so nathan what am i going to shade in 1st 55 tenths 5 tenths so 5 tenths is what
how am i shading in 5 tenths
i am not sure if it will i think there is a bell to be on there huh you got it on pink yeah it is on pink because that is what it was set as that is what we are going to leave it as do we have to have the colors change no you do not have to it is just easier to see the answer if you do that okay so 5 tenths in one direction what am i doing in the next direction
is the red light are you using highlighters yes okay so what does that mean it is overlapping what does this mean
so what is 50 hundredths times 3 tenths 1515 what 15000 hundredths 15 hundredths okay does that make sense yes 50 hundredths times 3 tenths is going to give me 15 hundredths no yes tell me andrew if it is 2 decimals it could get smaller or larger since you are multiplying below a whole you are multiplying below a whole so our decimal is going to be . smaller smaller it is not larger okay next one what is shown by the decimal model i want you to do this model on your paper on your graph and i want you to tell me what the number sentence should be on our in our notebook in your notebook so you have blank models
you are drawing this model and you are telling me what number sentence would be correct for that model do not forget to write your number sentence for the 1st one also that we did every model needs to have a number sentence with it yes the 1st one and that one and excuse me
the colors are just switched yes it is is not it but you all chose it so that is funny how that figured it out did not it write your number sentence your number sentence needs to have what you are multiplying by and you need to have the answer what is the answer to a multiplication problem
hey you are daydreaming you do not have time to daydream you should have already modeled that one on your paper here okay so what is the 1st model that is going across what does it show 5 tenths 5 tenths what does the next one show 3 tenths 3 tenths so we have 5 tenths times 3 tenths is going to give me what okay what did you notice it was the same one that you chose earlier is not that funny so which one is it a b or c c c c is correct okay next one now show this decimal model what does it show
put it on your paper as an example then try to find the number sentence okay you just have to move to the next one because you were not done do that one do that one do this one
it is fine you are just worried about having graph models you are not really worried about what that worksheet says okay write your number sentence so i can check
okay write the number sentence what does that show okay instead of counting what could you have done instead of counting all those individual boxes multiply multiply 4 times 7 is what 2828 make sure you put your decimal okay what is my number sentence 4 tenths 4 tenths times 7 tenths 7 tenths is going to give us what it is going to give us a what is the answer to this what does this represent 2828 hundredths this purple represents what 7 tenths 7 tenths and this represents
four . 4 tenths and when you multiply them together you get 28 hundredths 28 hundredths good okay next one you should model this one just write the number sentence you do not have to do the model just write the number sentence math journal is fine you do not have to model this one just write in your math journal write the number sentence i think we have the modeling we are pretty good so i should see a number sentence that includes what are you multiplying by and the answer
do not forget the answer okay which one is what am i writing here 2 tenths 2 tenths times 5 tenths equals 10 tenths so this represents what five . 5 tenths this is 2 tenths and then this is 10 tenths or 110th okay write the number sentence for this one
you do not have to do the model just write the number sentence look at the model
determine what the number sentence would be
okay i need to see number sentences check your answer here where is your number sentence makai okay how many okay count all the way up and all the way over each color like how many do i have going this way 66 what tenths tenths how many do i have going this way 7 tenths so this is 7 tenths this is 6 tenths so this whole section here is the overlapping this is not just the rows that you were looking at
you have to look at them this way you saw the 3 yeah you have to look at them this is the whole one color this is the whole one color so what is this answer 40 two . 42 hundredths so we have 6 tenths times 7 tenths equals 42 hundredths i saw a lot of 3s out there 3 tenths and you saw 3 tenths because you were just looking at this one color of 3 you have to look this way because this is shaded all the way across this is shaded all the way up does that make sense oh remember so if that confuses you you need to do the model so that you can actually see what you are doing okay so for this one it is going all the way . across across up so you count up how many is that seven . 7 tenths how many is here 110th
110th so 7 tenths times one tenths is going to give you 7 tenths because you should have how many shaded in here 7 overlapping 7 hundredths this is 110th and this is 7 tenths or 70 hundredths or 10 hundredths you can look at it either way because they are what they are equivalent okay now what we are going to do is you have some cards on your desk and i am going to move a few of you but i am going to explain to it 1st some of you have already played this game before because we introduced it . yeah the other day so you are going to have your cards
you are going to face them all down someone turns a card over you roll the dice so i turn the card over i roll the dice so i have one and 936 if i rolled the dice and got a 5 you are going to multiply that answer by 5 this is not a game you the person who rolled is going to work it out everybody else is going to check it to see if they are correct if they are correct they get the point you just keep playing this game until you use all the cards you can keep a chart with your initials so like this group has riley mia zuhal hayden left for a few minutes so you are just going to keep a tally of who points
you get one point for every correct answer okay i am going to move some of you around so you 3 are a group you 4 are going to move to this table
can we bring our math journal you take your math journal because you have got to do your work in your math journal cheyenne if you will move down one makai move back we need a scissor you do not need scissors and glue anymore here is your cards you are going to do you are going to play here so we put in the cards oh we forgot to glue that in we will glue it in in a minute we do not need scissors glue and carpentry not yet so you move back you are working with this group okay i need 12345 you all move to the round table cheyenne you all are staying right here you all are working here okay faithful come sit right here well i am confused makai you are sitting right here there is no confusion you moved without me telling you to move
you are sitting here i told you this does not matter you all are all playing this game we are not eating snack right now faithful you all are going to have to hold off i put my wrapper in the trash okay well just put it in a paper towel we do not want food on the math stuff okay somebody turn over a card okay roll the dice zuhal turned over the card she rolls the dice does she solve it the fastest nope she solves it all of you are going to be doing the same problem to make sure she is correct if she is correct she has to multiply it 1st if she is right she gets the point do they need 2 no one is yours shh on your bottom
have a seat have a seat shh have a seat okay you all should have already had one problem done who turned who rolled it
everybody else should be solving it with you to see if you are correct okay why do you all have so many cards who did it 1st who went 1st okay maddie you go 1st where is your math journal and pencil there is your number solve it everybody else is solving it while you are solving it to see if you are correct if she gets it correct she gets a point okay nathan have a seat okay whose turn is it solving it okay so you all should be solving it along with her so that you know that she is correct okay that is multiplying by 10
do you have to do all that work for that how could you do that you just add a 0 you just add a 0 is that how that works no it does not how it works what would ms hood say if you just said just add a 0 she would say . so she would say i am just going to add a 0 to my paycheck and see what i get right just going to add a 0
truitt to add zeros to my paycheck and see what she says what does it mean to multiply by 10 to just move the decimal move the decimal to what what does that mean to the right huh to the right okay so i am going to move my decimal on my paycheck to the right ms godfrey i reviewed this last night what does that mean what jasmine add a place value add a place value so i am multiplying by another what not a whole not a whole another place value so you are multiplying by a 10th yeah so you would move the 0 right and you would put the decimal right there correct you can not just add a 0 shh okay logan get busy
i do not know if she can be correct without a decimal wrong you got an 8 there right that would be the correct answer but you have to make sure you have all parts of the answer correct oh this one needs a mark oh yeah does anybody else get a point i get a point no you just get a point if you get it right hey i get a point i got a point i think i will do tally marks so i am doing it that way do it this way and then when you give 5 that is easier to keep count oh bottoms you have got to be on your bottom faithful
it is a good idea to have one person keep score for everybody okay we have to figure that out oh yeah 609 dude 16 i do not know who did you get 0 not 12 where are the 10s i do not know i do not know what did you get
1584 okay but how do you say that 1584 how should you read that decimal one and 8 multiply it by 5 and 812584 thousandths 584 thousandths so one and 584 thousandths what is that sloppy writing is what that is called what are you guys doing this is really easy huh okay so if you want to make it harder what could you do you could get 2 dice and make a 2 digit number or you could make it a decimal
you can make it harder go get another decimal or another cube i could do this oh you could you could multiply the decimal by the decimal you can make it harder if you want i did because i did not want them up on the desk shh okay faithful bottom you messed up do not be mad those are 6 you can not change your answer and it was an 8 before what did you do wrong say what did you do wrong i did 4 times 4 wrong because 4 times 4 is what 1616 did you add 4 +4 to get 8 did you add or did you multiply wrong i multiplied wrong because 4 times 4 is 16 okay all right next one
draw a card yeah they got a table here huh they have to tie well no whose turn was it it was makai is okay so did makai get it correct yeah okay do you have that problem set up correctly though where do you put that 4 when you are multiplying the decimal under the one so i do not get anything i am just telling you for future this is how you need to write it noise because when you have 2 digit numbers that you start multiplying that is not going to work this is what it is going to look like that is going to confuse you so you need to make sure that you write it correctly
oh i thought when you meant like line up then you like line up where it is . no you do not have to line up numbers in multiplying decimals noise i am knocking shit everywhere in the place you just made it a 9 did not i already get that card ms godfrey can i go to the restroom please yes yay 10 again that is i got 3.6 i beat you andrew i beat you aw man come on 10 come on 10 is that down no it rolled off the table i am being generous oh man he can not yeah he did
see see multiply the decimal by a double digit number i did these 2 down there by a double digit okay keep going how many should you all have left on here that is not fair lots
no come on guys you guys did this we have 2 bottoms to get up guys we decided to bring it all the way in no but you are going to like i am going to like yeah right oh yay what is what are you guys trying oh okay
okay we are going to do that okay okay you have 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left do not start that yet 2 minutes left do not start riley she does not know yet
why do not you just do it real quick and that is always your guy okay okay one minute you have one minute left so if you will start finishing up the last problem putting the cards back in the bag
you all did not have bags because i had it on the table yeah that is right so that is my point right you are right 33 you are right yours is correct okay i won clean up go back to your seat do not put anything away you are going to need it 54 faithful you have to stay there you can not move because of the camera 32 no one you should be ready logan should be ready you are waiting for the next directions okay on the board
is your ticket out the door you are going to show me what you know about multiplying a decimal if i am talking you are not i told him to sit there can you move into mia is desk please you are going to show me what you know about modeling a decimal by a decimal so you need out 2 colored pencils or crayons it does not matter to me what you do i am giving you paper write your name on it 1st put your hand down please let me give directions put your name on it 1st you should have 4 graphs left over on your worksheet that i gave you earlier 5 some have 5 some messed up so some people have 4 you are going to show the model for 123 and 4 you are going to write the number sentence you are going to show me the answer and write the answer
so you have got to do the model cut it out glue it onto the paper write the number sentence above or below it does not matter put your name on your paper is the 1st thing you need to do you have like 10 minutes to get this done you have to draw it on your graph that i gave you you are modeling it on here you are cutting this out gluing it on this paper writing the number sentence you will have to share scissors if you do not have your scissors with you i have a couple but i do not have enough for everybody okay since this is your ticket out the door should you be talking to the people around you no no wait you do not do that yet where is your graph paper okay show me the 1st model
show me 30 hundredths times 7 tenths cut it out you are gluing it onto the paper we do it 1st and then . it does not matter to me how you do it faithful have you got started where is your graph okay because you were not in here who else was not in here dylan do you have graph paper no you have to show me with colored pencils you can not show me shading with pencil it has to be colored pencils there is crayons in this box over here
