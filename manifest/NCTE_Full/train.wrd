alright so on your desks you have your multiplication cluster problem that you worked on this weekend for homework right and we started this on friday i gave you a little introduction we did set a together and i think you got to work on set b is that true before we left class on friday
okay who can talk to us about what multiplication cluster problems are what are these problems what is it all about what is the purpose of multiplication cluster problems so when i look at each set i see several problems and then a final so i see like 3 or 4 problems and a final problem what is the purpose of the cluster problems caroline
to help you to know the product of the final one does that add to what caroline said so she thinks that they have something to do with the final multiplication problem in the list leslie do you want to add to that the problem is that they gave you you have to choose 2 of them to help you with the final problem and did you find them to be helpful when you were solving them this weekend
so was there something from the list that you could choose to help you solve the final problem at the bottom raise your hand if you felt like there were some helpful ones in the list okay so you are given kind of a big challenging problem at the bottom of the list and those those related problem sets those clusters are the those clusters are there to help you break down the bigger problem
okay and in past experience nancy we have had to create our own problems right we have had to make arrays and break those larger problems down on our own and be creative and think about how to do that but in this case you do not necessarily have to be as creative to even give us a list of problems to choose from so that was pretty helpful was not it
okay so we did set a together but i want to show you an example of something that you will be working on this morning you are going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner so here is my example i have chosen set a since we already solved a together on friday so what you are going to do is here is your list of directions
i am going to give you and a partner a split and on that split is one of the sets on your sheet the only one that is not represented is a because i am doing a for you so i took a out of the possibilities so you might get set b c all the way to f you do not know which set you are going to get that is why i asked you to be prepared over the weekend and come in with them all finished already you are just going to add a little bit of some work to that today okay
so with the split a set that i give you you are going to solve each of the small more manageable problems in the cluster which you already have if you did all your homework so all you have to do is rewrite them on a slip of paper so you solve all the smaller ones okay then you are going to decide upon one or 2 problems to use to help you solve the final more challenging problem one or 2 okay
you might choose one and then have to add something from your own thinking or there might be 2 in the list that will help you get right to the product of the final problem i keep using the word product can somebody remind me what the word product means anna
yes so the answer to a multiplication helps you solve a product okay i really hope you understand that so solve each of the small problems decide which ones that will help you to get the answer of the large one then this is new you are going to draw an open array that matches what you chose
so whatever problems you chose to help you solve the final problem you are going to draw an array open array to help you visualize what this problem breaks down to look like okay what is an open array nancy
it does not have all the square units
so with the open array you do not have to do that right michelle yes so here is an example of what this will look like after you draw your open array we are going to write a short little description of how you solved the final problem and why you used the problems that you used so what were you thinking about when you chose each of the problems how did you come to the side on those particular problems
because mario you might work with chris and each of you are going to have the same set but you might want to use 2 problems and chris might want to use another 2 problems because he thinks about math in a different way he is making sense of breaking down the problems a little bit different is that okay to do is that okay yeah so if you are working with a partner on the same set is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem yeah what do you think brian yeah
do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses no no you with me pay attention pay attention who can answer my question who me why because the 4 of us may think a different way
so even though you have the support of your partner and you can work together and help each other carlos you might decide that you want to use the 1st 2 problems and edna if you happen to be with him you might decide you want to use the 3rd problem but make up your own 2nd problem that is perfectly fine you are just there to support each other you do not have to do the exact same work because you each have your own way of thinking about things and you each already thought about them for homework anyway
so it is up to you how you come to that conclusion of what to use solving each one deciding on which problems to use open array short description of your thinking why you did what you did and how you got to the final answer okay and then you are going to put it all together on a little sheet that looks something like this
similar yes exactly so you are going to glue on the slip that i gave you do the solving this is where you write your little explanation and your open array can go down here if you mix it up a little bit and it does not all go in the same exact spot that is fine with me as long as you have those components the answers to the small problems the description of how you solved it and why you did it that way and your open array with the dimensions what are the dimensions of an open array what do i mean by that yes
post what
so the number that goes on the side of the array and the number that would go on the top of the array right and one of those numbers will most likely be broken apart into smaller pieces okay so this is the small version to show you what yours will look like and then i just made kind of a gigantic version so you could see so i did set a 4 x 10 is 40 4 x 40 is 160 4 x 3 is 12 and 2 x 43 is 86
the final problem is 4 x 43 so what made sense for me when i was figuring out what to use to solve this was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 is it the only way i could have done it no but it was my 1st thought it was the 1st thought i had and the reason for that is i know that 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 gives me 4 x 43 because i took the 43 and i broke it into 2 smaller parts
i broke it into a 40 and a 43 right so this number sentence right here represents 40 groups of 4 which is this one +3 more groups of 4 which is this one gives me a total of 43 groups of 4 all i have to do is what add the what chris what is that word with the p the products right
i have to add the products from each of these and it gives me the product for the final one so i did not really have to do any extra work did i so that made sense for me are there other ways i could have solved it certainly but i only have to solve it in one way for this purpose madam yes on our paper do you have something that you can show why we use those to like get out of here yes please i would like for you to describe it as carefully as possible and put your thoughts down why would you trade each other
what are you going to like write on the paper what did you all learn in your notebook 1st once you have it all clear your arrays will be in your notebook right your big open array will be in your notebook the explanation will be in your notebook i will check it over and then i will give you the final poster paper no but i am talking about like you picked those 2 right yes do we have to show on the paper like the bad and the fine posts and whatever yes and as you can see on this small paper i wrote explain your thinking in words and numbers
so however you added it together whatever you multiplied explain why you did it that way and show your mathematical thinking does that answer your question yes okay any other are there any other questions no brandon it looks like like that we are making progress yeah it is a little bit and you will have a final project and we may or may not finish this today we got started a little bit late with the camera issue but if we do not finish it today we will finish it up tomorrow
but you should be able to get a significant amount of work done on it today okay and are there any questions no okay so i am picking partners when i pick your partners i want you to come to me and i am going to give you each a slip there is no gluing there is no final product until these are solved and the work is in your notebook
when all of that is finished and you have checked it all over and you are sure that it represents what you want it to say or to be then you can have it checked with me and i will just be walking around and helping you out you might end up sitting at other people is desks and that is fine with me just please be thoughtful of their belongings do not touch things that do not belong to you but we are going to be working at desks so whatever partner you get with you need to find a desk to work at you can not work on the same desk okay clear
and like i always say your partner is your partner for now you are not getting married so it does not matter who you are working with use them in the best ability that you have right you are sharing ideas okay so let us start with leslie and brian come on up get your slips one for each of you work together to solve a smaller part okay arlene and beth
arlene em and beth beth
no you have the same problem
so you can work on solving the smaller ones together but when it comes to how you are going to tackle that final one it will be a personal choice okay eamon and abraham stephanie stephanie no no stephanie
cessia and rayna aider is aider here no he is not here aider 0 i hope sickness has not struck david and michelle no
allison and edna nancy and josue alvin and edna catherine and mario and christopher and arlene s
and caroline and carlos you have 2 students absent and you are still even which is good carlos and caroline no all right so are we settled and how are you working together i just want to get the answers all right
so how are you working together okay so is 50 10 x 5
so the 50 is 10 x 5 so will this answer be 10 x 5 so how about 10 x 30 right
okay so will this answer be 10 x this product so how will i get that product think about it
i will be back back up a little bit i do not know where you are with this okay so you chose in order to solve 70 x 5 you chose this so this is 5 +7 +7 equals 9 right
and here i have 76 which is one so after you choose this one you choose this one this one right yes so 71 all right so right here
so the other problem is 70 x 5 right how is 70 x 5 related to this you already know the answer to 70 x 5 it is 80 x this okay and then what is the difference between these 2 problems this is 70 x 5 and this is 5 +7 so how many more groups of 5 is this
and then you change the number so if you do 70 x 5 you get this and if you do 6 more x 5 you get this all right that is it and you have to do it this way
okay all right and how are you sure that you have the answer brian who is your partner okay we are going to do it together we are going to do it together so that you are communicating better have you heard anything about these problems are you alive tonight you are awake all right so let us begin let us move over here to the right we will not hurt you okay it is not going to be hard anymore
and so did you figure out the answers to your small problem yet
so this is 58 times how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 what makes sense for you 58 x 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6
58 x 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 this is 2 groups of 58 right how many groups of 58 are there
you have no problem talking all right now i am trying to help you see the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6 how many x do i have to make this array to match this problem do you guys agree with me on this 3 x 3 x total or 3 more x
why and i only have 2 here but there is 6 so there is 6 here if i were to make this 3 more x what do i do to all these to get to the answer
so what i asked originally was what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6 it just happened about how i need 2 more of those so i would say this is only 2 more x that would mean that i have 4 of them with all of them
amy what would you do with these 3 problems i agree why would you add them all i agree with you yeah i agree with you each one is just too big to carry right so why would you add them all
6 how many units 6 so i add all of the unit 116 how many units of 58 do i have 8 units 8 units
exactly how you described it to me orally is what you want to write do you have another nice thing you want to use this time okay we will do that all right so talk to me
so you need to put your own symbol on the list so 50 x okay so you start with what is on the list and then you decide to make your own problem which is 8 x 6 okay i like that you did that and that this is definitely going to get you to the answer which is 8 x 6 however there is a multiplication here and so it is going to affect your result
what is 8 x 6 what is it 58 x 4
are you going to use your partner can you use karla to support you karla can you help caroline she is trying to solve the same problem but she is getting a different result
and this question asks you why you decided to go with a rate of one and you chose 17 x 5 to begin with and you chose 17 x 6 x 10 so you each come here for 7 points and you each can read about the problem in the 1st grade and you can explain that in writing and the words and the numbers and you learn a little bit about it okay you will learn
did you check your notebook your homework notebook see what you had to do okay well let me tell you what this means for you this means that you are a little bit behind because this work involving you has been done now you are going to start from scratch you are working on this idea you need to go through these problems and decide what is going to help you with this problem
can you do that pause it please excuse me how is it going over here michelle which set did you get b okay b yes okay and did you work together to solve the smaller problems yes yes
okay let us back up a little bit let me ask you this what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
3246 how many 2s are in 53 so how many times would you have to do 58 x 2 to get to 58 x 33 and let us maybe we can draw an array and see if that works out so 58 x 2 58 x 2
i am going to draw a really long or wide rectangle
and so i broke it is like breaking that large problem into how many different parts 3 parts right and this ends up being the total of 6 over here
so what ends up looking like in terms of long problem 58 x 2 +58 x 2 +58 x 2 equals the same as 58 x 6 so each of these multiplication problems in parentheses represent one sector of the array
so when you were trying to do 58 x 4 it was a 2 array and i think what we found out was that this was the addition part so we can do it that way all right so you and chris which sector did you choose 6
have a seat and i will come to you okay have a seat and i will come to you
how did you make sure that you had no tracking error in your strategies
how did you make sure that you were not making any mistakes
in about 2 minutes or so we are going to stop and do a debrief we are going to talk about some strategies that you and your partner used
and caroline i would like you to add 4 to 16 did you each get the same answer of 248 and did you solve it the same way
i chose is this 15 or 58 caroline this 50 x 6 is different than what you were doing here you chose 58 x 2 earlier 58 x 2 this is what all this work represents 58 x 2 your array is here your equation is here
your addition is here and then why did you start talking about a different problem there is it just a mistake what should this problem say is it 50 x 6 that you used or 50 x 2 that you used 50 x 2 is what you used you could have used 50 x 6 but you did not did you
and just re read your explanation to make sure it is exactly what you wanted to say well please start writing to me
so i will put this right here and that is okay for in your notebook
the whole thing is 10
and this would be a 4 in your array and this thing you can represent this array the same way horizontally
you have you have a tricky time with that use of the word double what is double i think it means you double this then you add it here what did you double
okay caroline and as soon as you can help him with that i will give you the sheet of paper that is what we are waiting for time to go so 58 x 2 because i got the half of 6 and separated it into 3 pieces of 2
thirds really right thirds you took 6 and you split it
i chose and and solved that problem 3 x because 2 is 13rd of 6 instead of half of 6 you can still talk about fractions if you want to but 2 is not half
so you talk to me about it somebody chose 58 x 2 and what did you do with it and i how many x did you do 58 x 2
2 is 13rd of of 62 is 13rd of 62 +2 +2 is 6 and your major your major long line of equations is right here this represents your array here is your picture here is your equation it is complicated
it is it you know what it is very complicated that is why we have lots of possibilities for what you said it is complex is this on time or no time a couple minutes a couple minutes i want to pause you and i do want to have a couple minutes of a debrief is there any could i have one group one partnership that is close to being finished to come up and kind of talk about what they did
we can have 2 groups if we have time arlene you sort of raised your hand i know you are not fully done with your poster and that is fine but could you could you still come up could you still come up here and talk about it you can pick one of your ways if you want you do not i know you went all out and did 2 strategies but if you want to just pick one way you can do that you want to could you do that okay come on up tell us what set you were working on hold on
everybody else is pausing please caroline sit down all the way on the bottom i was working on set c okay what was the final problem you were going to solve 32 x 8 okay was there were there any other partners working on set c no okay so listen carefully think about whether you did it similarly differently or or what
i used 32 x 8 okay so the main problem is 32 x 8 and you did 30 x 8 okay and why did you do that because i needed to add 8 to what how many quarters of 8 do you need
you did 30 you did 30 x 8 how many more quarters of a do you need for 32 x 8 all right all eyes up here let us tell barbie so your major problem is your final difficult problem is 32 x 8 okay right
and you did 30 x 8 30 x 8 what else would arlene need to do she did 30 groups of 8 how many groups of a does she need to have 32 so how many more groups of of 8 do you need 2 more groups of 8 right you still have to multiply this 2 by the 8 you did the 30 x the 8 but you have to multiply all the parts of this number by this number
so i still need the 2 x 8 so you have this answer right which is what 240 and so how many more or how much more do you have to add with 2 x 8 16 yes
did you say 16 i might have misheard you so what happens when you combine 30 groups of 8 +2 groups of 8 what do you get as a total 256 very good very good thank you one more group one more partnership
caroline do you want to come up i think you can do it you did a lot of work over there come on up you have no problem speaking up right okay what was your set set b okay set b which is what but what is the final problem carlos what is the final problem in set b
what 58 x 6 58 x 6 who else did set b any other partners adrian are you paying attention are you paying attention it does not look like it can you show me that thank you all right 58 x 6 what did you do i broke it into i broke it into 6 the 6 yeah
so caroline took the and caroline and carlos took the 6 and they broke it into 32s 246 and then so what was 58 x 2116116 and you had to do that how many times
and we talked about a fraction because we are having some people are having a hard time with the word doubling doubling means multiplying something by 2 right but doubling is not the word we always use when it comes to multiplication it depends on what you are doing so 2 is not half of 6 right 6 is not 22 so these 2s are what fraction of 6 caroline 13rd 2 is 13rd of 6 that is why you have to do it 3 x
does that make sense okay usually we take the big problem and we make 2 smaller problems but with caroline she made it made more sense to her to do 3 problems because she used the 58 x 2 and what did you get as your answer so all these groups of 2 add up to the 6 and the 58 for a total of 30348
who else did group set b and abraham and aiden what did you get 348 is your answer all right so we are going to pause on that i know that none of you know their poster who did not even get to start their poster today me okay we are going to this is a 2 session project anyway so we will finish this up tomorrow go ahead and put that work that you are going to do over there please may i show the finished work okay
all right everyone should have their mountain math sheets out where is your mountain math sheet
you do not have one you were in here yesterday morning when we went over the things on the board correct so you should have had one of these do you remember what you did with it soleil just sit in your seat sweetheart
sit in your seat all right so mountain math this week yesterday we had an opportunity to go over number one
and i am glad we did because we got an opportunity to look at partial product again yesterday and i got a chance to see that some of you guys still need that review so very good we also looked at number 2 yesterday and we talked about the 2 systems of measurement that we use what are those 2 systems called customary and metric customary and metric system
pints would fall under which system can anybody tell me pints would fall under which system what is the system that we primarily use here in the states customary system very very good now the question there says which item would most likely have this weight or capacity
when we are trying to figure out when you hear pint are you thinking about weight or are you thinking about capacity
capacity which is how much a seat can hold which is measured in cups pints quarts ounces gallons very very good a little out of order but should be good it is not how much it is how much it can hold but what is it holding when you are talking about capacity what is it holding liquid
liquid very very good now let us look at number 3 number 3 is a review of place value okay and what we are trying to do quick review you are trying to see or you are going to tell me the number 2 or the digit 2 in each one of these numbers you are going to tell me the place value so read the 1st number for me mackenzie
124784531 531 very good the 2 is in which place which place i know it do not give me the value of it tell me which place it is in what did you say
tell me what you said what is the place value meaning which place is it in is it in the ones place is it in the 10s place is it in the 100s place it is in the 10s place say it loud it is in the 10000000s it is in the 10000000s place now knowing that it is in the 10000000s place what is the value of that 2 20000000 20000000 you just have to be confident
i heard you say it the 1st time you just have to speak up okay all right what about the next number morris read the next number for me the next number is go back there if you have to 314728 314728
what is the place value of the 210s place it is in the 10s place now that 2 being in the 10s place what is the value of that 2 20 units say that again 20 units 20 units or 2210s 20 very very good the next number casey 682986
682986 what is the place value of the 2000s 1000s place what is the value of that 2 in the 1000s place 2000 very good chris do the last number for me 2734879 say it again 2734879 very good you just left out the 1000 the 1st time
okay what is the place value of the 2000000s it is in the 1000000s place the 2 being in the 1000000s place what is the value of that 24000000 excellent job put your mountain math away and get out your calendar math as soon as you get over there plop down get started
you are going to run no you are going to run me over elijah
you are right here but if he wants to he can okay it is not a problem yes sir i i put it to start calendar today you want to start calendar today okay back here ladies come on did you do calendar at your old school no did you do calendar at your old school no all right come on back here
i do not have time for this soleil sweetie you do not i do not have time for this okay so what you are going to have to do is get a sheet of notebook paper and come on back because you got to put your papers where they belong we have to get you organized you got to be able to transition
here you go leave your chair sweetheart you can sit on the floor monsey make sure you can see what is going on so turn around
all right adam spoke up today and adam said ms lee i want to get us started with calendar today okay i am going to give you a 2nd hold on shh
i am giving you guys a 2nd here soleil all right i am going to go ahead and let adam get us started all right talk to me adam
the fraction to decibels the fraction could be 109 over 180 the fraction could be what 109 over 180 does this model 109 over 180 do we have 180 total pieces here i got 200 units
you could you are going to have to end up having 200 units okay but if you look at this let us put it in the form of a mixed number 1st what would the mixed number be it would be one and 9 hundredths it would be one and 9 hundredths
okay one and 9 hundredths how would you convert this mixed number to an improper fraction you have a whole here 9 hundredths this supports this you would divide it hold on give him a chance
you would add 100 to 9 you would add 100 to 9 and it leaves the denominator the same okay what you would end up doing is you would do 100 times the one you get 100 +9 will give you what 109 109 and he said you leave your denominator the same you leave your denominator the same
can you also do 0 no you can not can i also do what one times 9 equals 100 i mean one times 9 equals 9 +100 and one times 100 we do not want to go backwards just go the way the operation tells you to go because you will not always have a one as your whole number okay alright nor will you always have 100 as your denominator okay alright
now is there another way that you could write this one and 9 hundredths priyasi you want to come up here and show me and you can write it equally on your side there very very good one and 9 hundredths what does this look like when you see that what do you think of yes you see a decimal
yes you are right what else
say that again he says he thinks of a one.09 how many pennies does it take to make a dollar 100 100 so knowing that this can also be thought of as one.09 what is the place value of the 9
what is the value of the 9 if there are 100 pennies in a dollar what is the place value of the 9 joshua hundredths it is in the hundredths place very very good today is the 30th day of school not the 30th day of school but it is the 30th day of january
i did the same thing yesterday ms lee ms lee ms lee ms lee classify that number for me okay so 1st she said it was even how do we know when a number is even how do we know when a number is even davis can you look in the ones place if it is 0 2 4 6 8 okay yeah very very good
equal groups can go into it it can be split into 2 equal groups very very good now shiela what else do you have if it can be divided by 2 if it can be divided by 2 if it can be divided by 2 in division you have your dividend 30 divided by 2 your dividend is your total number of items correct mackenzie your divisor is your total number of groups
so that supports what we just said with rex we can split it evenly into 2 what groups groups perfect but you just said it a different way very good now she also said that 30 was composite who can provide me evidence to support 30 being composite well let me backtrack a little bit what is a composite number
what is a composite number joshua
what is a composite number monty a composite number is a number that has 3 or more factors a number that has 3 or more put it in my hand 3 or more factors very very good now who can list the factors for 30 for me on the board up there
me
what else can you tell me up here which fraction is not not in simplest form ms lee 3 which one is not in simplest form 3 put your hands down for a 2nd i have a quick question
you know how i am always telling you guys when you are doing problem solving and you are reading problems you got to make sure you understand the vocabulary 1st what does this mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form i know ms lee i know i know what does that mean chris
hold on just a 2nd say that again
the only factors they have in common are one very good the greatest common factors that they have in common are what one or is what 11 very very good so the question asks which fraction is not in its simplest form and you got to tell me how you know
ms lee elijah 9 twelfths he says 9 twelfths is not in its simplest form because if you could divide it by 3 i would give you 3 fourths excellent excellent job he gave me an answer he gave me evidence to support his answer
i did not have to ask you again hit the bucket alright josh morris i noticed a pattern on the calendar okay what pattern do you notice they are all the same fractions they are just rotated around they are all the same fractions but they are just rotating and we saw this at the beginning of the month how you have a 12th a 4th a 3rd then a half and it repeats itself
a 12th a 4th a 3rd and a half very very good all right but you are just saying that it rotates it is like the shaded area is rotating around the circle which direction is it going in and when i say direction is it going clockwise
or is it going counterclockwise ms lee casey you look at a clock is it going do your hands go this way to the right or do they go to the left come on ms lee
yeah it is going tuesday and then look at saturday and it is going that way look here if you go from tuesday to wednesday 0 yeah i thought you meant like the same fractions no but wait a minute you may have discovered something else what do you mean when you say the same fractions come up here and show me because i say it is going clockwise all right i see the pattern is going clockwise how about you davis
okay so show me what you see like that one is right there and so then that one is moving counterclockwise and then this one is also moving counterclockwise okay here to here to here okay so what you were looking at is the same fractions from one let us write those numbers down
one 5 9 13 17 21 25 and 29 guess what i would have to agree with you and maybe the way i said it confused you guys
but if you are looking at the same fraction if you are looking at a 12th here and a 12th here and a 12th here it does look like it is going counterclockwise but what i was talking about is i was saying if you are going from a 12th to a 4th from a 4th to a 3rd from a 3rd to a 12th i am sorry to a half but guess what it is just based on what you see
so very very good and thank you for explaining that you put up a column between 5 and 9 okay there we go 0 look at the numbers that we put up here wait a minute wait wait wait these are all of your numbers and i think i left off i got them all up there all of your numbers that have a 12th shaded in what could you say about all of those numbers
what do they have in common they are all odd numbers what does it mean for a number to be odd what does it mean for a number to be odd tyrese
when you can not give wait an odd number if there is a one in the ones place a 131357 or 9 in the ones place then it is an odd number
a 13579 i agree what is another way i think because most odd numbers they can not be divided divided by what by even numbers i mean into even groups
well 25 can not so can 21 so can 21 so can 9 most odd numbers no help him out because he is on the right track but help him out it does not have like a multiple or something like i can not do it 0 yeah
i do not know chris it can not be divided by 2 it can not be divided by 2 remember when we showed here your divisor what you are dividing by tyrese your divisor when it is 2
if you have an odd number 2 will not the number that you have 25 cannot be split evenly into 2 groups meaning if this is missus lee and tyrese and we are trying to share 25 chocolate chip cookies guess what i am probably going to get a little bit more than you simply because each of you gets 12.5 i will not split the half
i will probably just take a whole you all already know that but evenly but you know what you can say 12.5 but that half is that half a whole number no no no it is not so that is why this would not be considered an even number very good very good now i am going to say one more everybody to your seat and we are going to look at what ife did
put your clipboards back hold on hold on go to your bathroom sweetie and wash your hands no do not touch anything come on clipboards back aziz he just sneezed
aziz sneezed in 321 okay ife came up here and we were classifying the number 30 and someone said that 30 was a composite number so ife tell us what you did
i did the multiple i mean the factors for 30 and what equals 30 if you multiply those 2 factors together and then i listed the factors very good let us see what she did here all right now we want to make sure that we try to always list the factors in order correct so that we do not get mixed up and we do not leave anything out
so put your hands down for a 2nd so she started off good right here one times 30 okay she did one times 30 but we determined that 30 was an even number so if you know that 30 is an even number you know that 30 can be divided evenly into 2 groups
so pretty much what i just said is that 30 divided by 2 gives you a number without a remainder or your quotient without a remainder so what number or what 2 factors should i have right here please ms lee give us some time
30 split into 2 groups how many will be in each group 5 well if i put 5 in each group you all remember how to do partial quotient yeah ms lee all right if i have partial quotient . yes help me out here you can go ahead and put 5 and you say 5 times 2 will give you what
1010 how many do i have left 20 then you do 0 okay then what 0 i still have 20 20 of that 20 ife how many can i put in each group you can put 10 in each group
okay so i would say 10 times 2 would give me 20 you said times okay so what goes here 20 i subtract and i get 0 i add up these numbers here and what do i get 1515 my quotient is 15
very good i was standing up here trying to remember how we organized it i forgot but 5 10 1515 is our partial quotient all right wait a minute we have not gotten there yet so i can not believe we are still doing this that was a good review right there though okay so we have 2 times 15 3 times 10 okay can 4 go into 30 evenly 4 times 7 28
4 times 8 nope 5 yes 6 this is just inverse very good what property is that representing commutes to property what else 7 can 7 go into it evenly no 8 no 9 no wait what yes 9 no no 10 she already had that one this is just the inverse of that so she has one
there should be a 2 here 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 so what she was missing over here you had your 30 over here sweetheart you were just missing your 2 and your 15 okay so very very good hit the bucket and you did a good job explaining yourself all right hit the bucket get out your homework from last night
on yesterday how do we add and subtract mixed numbers this is a review okay it is a review put your hand down for a 2nd 0 this is a review or it was a review and what i want you all to do without saying anything i just want you to check your answers right now
that is what i want you to do everyone should be checking their work give it to me thank you everyone should be checking their homework
where is your homework ms lee you are getting in front of screen yeah i will move it down just hold on a 2nd
hold on a 2nd move it up
i know just turn away all right so john had a question his hand popped up 1st and i think his question was with number 4 what was your question sweetheart
well i always tell you guys you have to do what you have to answer the question okay so what fraction of a dollar does she have yeah you could have written 3 fourths but so that i know that you understand and you gave me a clear cut solution i would have said 3 fourths of a dollar
now is there any way that you could have shown or modeled this any way you could have modeled it or any equation that you could have you know written to represent it i do not know mackenzie you could have drawn a rectangle come show me let her finish put your hands down
you could have drawn a rectangle huh split it into 44 groups huh i mean colored in 3 very very good 3 quarters and a dollar very very good yes could you have also done it ¢75 over a dollar yeah ¢75 over a dollar yes you could have that is what i did 3 quarters and hillary finds 3 quarters
3 quarters equals ¢75 what fraction of a dollar does she have 75 of a 100 but what did they provide you here these are the same but how are they the same how do i get from this to this because there is 4 quarters to a dollar huh and 75 that is 25 75 that is 3 quarters and a 100 is 4
so 75 is 3 because 75 is 3 quarters and a 100 that is 4 quarters so it is 4 75 is 3 quarters it is equivalent to 3 quarters and 100 is equivalent to 4 quarters very very good now how could i have went from here to here what operation could i have used adam division division and you could have divided by what
i would have divided by 43 over 3 what would be my greatest common factor between 75 and 100 25 25 that is all you got to do is slow down 25 over 25 and i would have gotten 3 fourths 3 fourths is just my answer in what simplest form simplest form very very good did i have questions about any of the other problems here
any other questions upton on number 8 i got d number 8 he got d i did not get it all right let us look at it let me stand back here the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13 when we do sum what are we referring to rest addition addition
okay the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place and 3 more than the one is digit
what is the number it is both who got it right i want to tell you how i would have gotten this answer i would have taken what they said here and i would have tried it out with each one okay i would have tried it out with each one but wait a minute the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number
that would have immediately eliminated d because d is what even how do we know that d is even everybody be quiet because the last number . now you see why it does not work yeah you got to read all of it it is an odd number i was thinking that like i did not look at the odd number i thought that was just like an example
so then i started with the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than that one yes but you have to read all of it the sum of the digits of a 3 digit number all of these are 3 digits the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13 so the 1st thing i would have done is i would have actually added all these up to see if they were 13 plus the sum of the digits
and this one did not equal 13 so we crossed that one off 0 so this one did not equal 13 and it was even immediately i would have x would out d okay very very good hunter when i 1st i did it 2 times huh i 1st did i read the 4 less part
huh i thought 6 was a for some reason huh and because i did not read the whole thing that is why we have to read guys we have to read davis i am going to write about it i got something different on it i did i added 4 and 2 fourths +one and 3 fourths we got 5 and 5 fourths
but 5 fourths is not proper fractions so i divided 5 fourths 5 fourths divided by 4 and got one over 14th because after i divided i subtracted 4 -5 huh now give me one i know and get the 4 that is my denominator and added it to 5 and got 6 and 14th very good did you get b for 7 yes excellent excellent job my mom taught me how to do it on the back very very good i want we are going to stop homework right now
and i want you all to open up your composition books okay and i actually want you to go ahead and just turn to the title page or the table of contents and in your table of contents you will just use a sheet of notebook paper sweetheart in your table of contents i want you to go ahead and write today is date january 30 2013
and i want you to write we will write addition and subtraction mixed number review now you guys know the main reason that we are doing this is because you know things are moving so fast i just want to make sure you understand okay
and so what is going to happen is let me stop for a 2nd and let you guys get organized
all right i want you all to number your paper from one to 27 skip lines because you are going to write the problem act like you have fraction you are going to have fraction problems but you are going to have answers so you do one and you do a space 2 3 4 yeah like 2 spaces more like 2 spaces thank you yeah just space it out and go one to 27 you can actually do 2 columns
5 on that front good
so you are going to go from one to 27
and i am putting an index card on your desk do not do anything to it yet go to the back if you have to
or the next page a lot of extra number 6 27 that is what i said did you get one 27
27 stay on track 27 yeah i have got number 27 now everybody has an index card on their desk okay what you guys are going to do is you are going to actually locate the number on your card what number is this i am going to show you all where the number is located the number is located in the top left hand corner
like here this one is number 10 it is in the top left hand corner and you are going to write that problem down by the number and you are going to solve it but you guys get a chance to start moving around in the classroom after you solve the number on your card you go trade with a friend you solve the next number and you trade with someone else you solve that one and you trade with someone else until i call time did we get it yes
all right we are going to start in one minute we are going to start in one minute and actually it is going to be more like 45 seconds and you are going to start with your problem and then you are going to get a chance to no running just walk okay
what do i have i am not telling you just work at your own pace do not rush make sure you do the ones that you have correctly can you just write the answer no i want the problem and the answer and it is okay to trade you do not have to keep your same card
you just trade after you solve that problem you just keep trading you may begin
pay attention to the operations because it is mixed review trying to find somebody to trade with you can trade with me i will trade with you
i will trade with you
0 let me see what we are writing all right so you have 5 and 3 fifths 0 you did it on 12 okay go ahead and write get up and move girl move your bottom
you need somebody to trade with i would love to trade with you there you go you need somebody to trade with there you go you want to trade with me there you go i would love to trade my dear
okay let us see how we are doing over here okay let me check you out you are doing a great job let me show you something here let me see your pencil you did a great job here you added your fractions 1st your numerators 1st 3 well one and 3 is 4 you brought down your denominator 2 and 3 is 55 and 4 fourths
4 fourths equals what one whole so could not you go ahead and write your answer as 5 and 4 fourths equals if it is 6 wholes very very good you can go ahead and simplify that answer okay instead of keeping it that way does that make sense okay very good
okay let me get number 25 where is your pencil so you had 7 and 3 fifths -one and 3 fifths 6 and 0 fifths
well if you do not have if 3 fifths -3 fifths is 0 what should what should this be it should just be 6 very good there is no 0 fifths
okay well you could have no fifths depending on what the question asks but when you write if you are doing just straight computation like this you would see that 3 fifths and 3 fifths when you subtract 3 fifths and 3 fifths that cancels that out and you end up with 7 -one and you get what a difference of 6 okay 5 sure like so
yes because i had 27 and i did not know you had to do the same number what do you mean for example if i if i if i had 27 and i did not know you i absolutely could ..
0 you do not worry about that sweetheart you just keep working okay you want to try it with me 0 you got it right
you are okay you just keep working okay thank you all very much
thank you all very much thank you all very much thank you all very much you dropped some paper i already got this one i already got it we are going to try it with somebody else okay go try it with somebody else you tried it with me twice okay let us see what you are doing here okay i am going to see we are both small so i can see you
let me see all right let me see what you are doing okay good job simplify okay 0 here you did not simplify you just provided an equivalent fraction now what could you have done here 4 and 6 tenths yeah you can simplify that
now show me how you would simplify the fraction part of that mixed number very good which is equivalent to 4 and 6 tenths very good 6
0 me 0 my have you done that one yet no who do i need to find 0 me 0 my let us try it again i do not know how to do it you done 21 no all righty
i do not know how to get it then whatever you have i have done 5 and 6 tenths let us look at this one let us look at this i have been waiting for somebody
let me see your hands okay all right right here you have got 5 and 6 tenths how would you convert the fraction part of that to a proper fraction or a mixed number because you would invert an improper to a mixed number so i am going to come down here with your answers okay and you have got 5 and 6 tenths do you remember how to convert an improper to a mixed do not you need to write it
yes you show me 12345678 i do not know but i do not want them to make us have to stop davis one and 15th one and a 5th so if you got one and a 5th as your mixed number for this that cancels this out right
so you have 5 wholes and one and a 5th what do you need to do to those 2 to make your answer do you add half of this one and then add this one yes and so what do you end up getting 6 and 13rd i mean 15th very good girl girl girl girl
stop you have been trading with me a lot i have number 18 can i trade i already did number 18 can you do number 25 all right can you do number 25 no 0 yeah i will trade with you can i trade with you i have 18 you did number 27 yeah i do not have it i got number 27
i have number 27 the last person i saw had good number one was chris i have number one the last person i saw had everyone is number 10 she traded with me what do you have 18 5 no 5 i have 5
have you had let me see if i have any low numbers on here you have had number 5 you have had number 17 you have had 19 you have had 5 you have had . yeah you have not had 15 there you go
i do not know what you had because you do not have your answer 321 freeze i want everyone to go back it is okay everyone to your seat and i want you to finish up that last problem sorry that you are working on
everyone to your seat and finish up the last problem that you are working on convert it huh you had your chance yes go to your seat
very good good practice to use in 321 mouths are off and everyone is seated mouths are off and everyone is seated
now i am going to put up some of the answers and i want you to check your work see how good you did okay you guys ready yes all right we are ready we are ready yes all right shh check your work
you see it mackenzie close my door shh shh
bless you you will notice my answers
i provided you the simplest form i converted any improper fractions to mixed numbers have a seat and check your work
can you go back shh and it is okay if you did not get all of them done yes
how did we do wrong yes i got all wrong yes i want everybody to put your head on your desk down down i do not want to see your eyes heads down do not want to see your eyes do not want to see your eyes i want you to raise your hand if you need my help hands down
i want you to i am going to be more specific raise your hand if you do not understand how to convert an improper to a mixed number hands down
raise your hand if you need help simplifying fractions if you understand all of it stand up and say i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this all right everybody sit down i got this
sit down chris do not ruin it hands down for homework tonight we are going to come back i just had to get my hand and what i want you all to do is still problem solving because tomorrow you get an opportunity to go back and look at your chapter 15 test
okay and you are going to be practicing adding like fractions meaning like denominators 15 one and on the back you are going to be subtracting like fractions meaning like denominators 15.2 show all of your work and guys number 9 on here you need to answer that okay
give me a clear well thought out response understand yes madam understand yes madam now antonella did something that i thought was very smart she took her homework from last night and she glued it into her composition book i would like for you all to go ahead and do that while i pass out your homework and once you are done you can go ahead and take a restroom break
and when you come to the door bring me the index cards glue it in hold on a 2nd let me pass these out okay yeah you do not have a composition book yet you just got here
so i am going to have to send your mom another send her a supply list okay i know they gave her one in the office but i need to email her if you did not get homework raise your hand
i did not tell anyone to open my door i said i would be standing at the door to get the index cards so close my door
what have we been talking about so far this week in math who can give me a couple of ideas of things we have discussed ben graphs okay we have been talking about graphs what kind of graphs have we explored this week chucky line graphs okay we have talked about line graphs celeste bar graphs bar graphs that has been most of our focus this week at a couple of other times we talked about some other things matthias pie graphs okay we have kind of talked about pie graphs noah double line graphs we talked about double line graphs
last one celeste
okay good we used tally marks to help us create those charts i like the fact that you remember that alright judging by what i have on the board what type of graph do you think we are going to be talking about today let us get some help from marcy
good we are going to be talking about a pie graph does anybody know another name for the pie graph anna circle graph circle graph why do you think we call it that max why do you think max why do you think we call it that because it is a circle that represents the amount of the sets okay good mainly because it is a circle okay so we have our circle graph it is on the board
what are some things you notice just by looking at it celeste give me one thing that you notice that half of it is colored blue good all of this side half of this is colored blue what is this graph about jaydon what do you think this graph is showing us it is books in the jaydon books books books what in the library books that are in the library so it is showing us these are all the books that are in the library
and it is showing us what parts are what different types of books so it is showing us 4 different types of books what is one type of book that it is showing us sandra non fiction okay it is showing us non fiction books chase fiction number one it is also showing us fiction books
okay should i put them here she is not in here right now thank you chase what other type of graph i mean i am sorry what other types of books is it showing us we got fiction non fiction history historical fiction good those are books that are historical tru i am sorry not true but they are based on things that still happened in history we are missing one other type stephanie what other type of book is up here
emily help us out we got historical fiction non fiction fiction and biographies biographies good i like the fact that emily is answering when i call on her alright so we have got 4 different things that are being shown here what is the book that we have the most of in the library you can probably tell this pretty quickly by looking at the graph what is the book that we have the most of in the library lisa
what doe we have the most of in the library fiction good how can you tell that so easily noah because it is it is half and all the others are not bigger than half good i like he said this is half the other is not as big as half but we can tell most of it is colored blue by looking at this graph pretty simply do we have any numbers up here yet no no but we can still tell andrew what do we have the least amount of green
historical fiction this green section here excellent job very good okay today we are going to work on making our own circle graph let me tell you how we are going to do this the 1st thing that we are going to do you are going to get a chart that looks like this and you are going to get an imaginary sorry guys it is imaginary
an imaginary $100 it has to be imaginary because i am not the richest person in the world and i do not have a $100 to give you if if i did i would alright so you have a decision to make you have to decide how you are going to spend your $100
if you had a budget of $100 for the month and you had to decide where you were going to spend this money you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it i am going to show you how i might spend it okay you are going to have some different categories that you can spend it in so you have you have some important choices to make 1st choice you have to decide how much money you are going to spend on food for the month what are some things that you might spend money on for food
just go ahead and give me a couple of quick examples alexis cakes i am going to call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands i appreciate that alexis go ahead food yeah what types of food might you buy bread okay you might buy bread celeste
milk olive garden okay you might treat yourself to olive garden martina junk food okay you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food good alright next category brussels sprouts next category just kidding we are going to talk about clothing now you get to decide if you we are going to wait you are going to decide how you are going to spend if how much money you want to spend on clothes
you might decide that you only want to spend $10 on clothes you might decide that you want you saw this jacket the other day and you really want to buy it and it is $70 you might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing we are also going to take a look at games what are some things .
raise your hand if you can tell me 11 type of game or one game example that you might be interested in
okay alexis grand theft auto okay naya
okay good hands down alright you are .
putting our hands down does not mean we shout out what answer we were going to give 0 man you have also got movies if you are interested in either one of 2 things here hands down there is 2 different types of movies that i am thinking here one is if you wanted to go to the movies the 2nd one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the dvd of it so you have a couple different things to think about there then finally we have got toys
if there is a certain type of toy 0 i left one off sorry books you c .
yeah you get to decide which area you are going to spend how much money so for example i am going to choose 3 different categories i am going to show you what i would do for my chart you are going to get to do this in just a moment but i am going to show you how i might decide to spend my money so at this point our pencils are still down our eyes are still up here i appreciate that entire 2nd row excellent job alright so expenses
i am going to decide that i am going to spend money on clothes and i am only going to choose 3 things you have to choose at least 3 categories but you can choose more if you want to i am also going to choose books and i am also going to choose fl food for my categories now the .
the 1st thing that i am going to do i am going to decide how much money i am going to spend on each area now how much money did i say that i had in all ben a 100 a 100 bucks alright i have a $100 in all to spend so i have to make sure that my total is going to equal $100 okay i can not spend just $50 total i have to make sure the whole thing is going to be $100 so for example gentlemen
i am going to spend i am going to go with $30 on clothes no let me go $40 on clothes
i am going to go with $40 on clothes i am going to go with $30 on books and i am going to go with .
$30 on food say what so the next thing naya brought up a good point it ha yes it has to equal a $100 so 40 and let me double check 40 and 30 is 7070 and 30 is 100 so i am good i do not have to use round numbers you could do $12 or $9 it is up to you as long as your total for your categories equals $100 next i am going to go to the following category what is your question
then do not be next category amounts spent out of $100 if you have to start it like that it is not going to be good okay okay dollars spent out of $100 alright so i am going to write a fraction this amount would be what how much out of 100 did i spend on clothes
i 40 how much $4040 out of 100 so my fraction is going to be 40 over 100 celeste help me out here books what would my fraction be for books celeste 30 out of a 100 excellent $30 out of $100 and the last one let me get some help from sandra how much am i spending on food as a fraction 30 over a 130 out of 130 over 100
now when we have talked about percentages all year long what did we say was always true about percentages they always had to be what max based out of a 100 based out of 100 well guess what we are lucky today with our fractions these are all out of 100 so this is going to be pretty easy i hope for us to convert to percentages jaydon what percentage of my money am i spending on clothes 4040% what percentage of my money am i spending on books daniel 30
30% and what percentage of my allowance or my budget am i spending on food matthias 30% 30% excellent job now after we have gotten our percentages i am going to have an opportunity to make my own circle graph now probably the hardest part about a circle graph is splitting it into the right number of sections
one of the papers that i have given you already has it you do not have to worry about it i am going to show it to you up here alright the circle graph that i am going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute not right now the circle graph that you are going to get already has 100 spots marked okay
so all i am going to do on my circle graph i have a 100 marks i need to color in 40 of those as clothes so let me give you kind of an idea of what you are going to do here i am just going to kind of i am going to start here for my clothing chucky eyes up here please eyes up here i am going to start here so 12345678910
did you just notice something about where that line is naya each like triangle equals 10 good each one of these big triangles is 10 but if i needed to do like 12 could i stop there yeah i can stop there and just draw a line but i did not do 12 so i am going to go 10203040 so .
this section is going to be 40% of my circle now just like on the graph we were looking at earlier this needs to be colored one color next i have books what should i probably do before i move on to books count it
before i move on to books what should i do emily label it ah and then great label it cause here is what is going to happen i am going to do books next and i am going to forget which one was clothes so i am just going to label this as clothes for right now and i can do one of 2 things i could either put $40 or i would put 40% and since it is a pie graph i think we should put 40% as our amount i am sorry you could put dollars that is showing the amount
but because we are doing a circle graph i think it is usually better to use percentages okay books i am going to do the same thing except that i am going to go 102030 so this section would be books books and what percentage would that be stephanie 3030% excellent job now am i going to color these the same color no no we are going to make sure that we have 2 different colors and then .
well 3 or 4 different colors depending on how many categories you are choosing then my last section would be food and i am going to label this as food and that would also be 30% there is one other thing that i want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute any ideas on what that might be what is one thing .
with my circle graph that i do not have right now celeste a title ah a title and i am not going to write it cause i would end up writing way up there on the wall but i would put my title what is a ti and of course you can be more creative with your title that i am probably going to be an example of a title i might have how i would spend my $100 can we change it out for the dollar sign yeah you could well you want to give us an idea .
the purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about if i titled it $100 it is a cute name like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody is interest but people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about chucky my budget okay my budget how i would spend my $100 naya my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot celeste
i am just trying to double check do we have to use all of them okay okay excellent question you do not have to use all of these categories you have to choose at least 3 if you want to do every category you can but if you would rather ju let us say you know that you want to buy one book and that is only going to be $5 include it do $5 on a book okay but you have to choose at least 3 categories to purchase things in
chase do we have to put money in the categories cause i got clothes movies and food and i put 90 in clothes and 10 in food okay that is up to you we have not actually started yet i am going to put one other category up here and this is just to give you another option we are going to do a savings category if you would like to put some money aside to save for later you can always put it in the savings any other questions before we start today naya
like yours do we have to do that key ah excellent question naya asked a good question that i did not go over i love that do you need to do a key i would say yes it is going to be more clear if you have a key when you look at a graph in a book does it usually give you a key yeah excellent so when you have a graph you should pretty much always plan on including a a key any other questions before you get started all right before you flip your papers over and get started .
i do not mind if you are in a whisper but you need to be at your seats working on your graph if you do finish early if you finish before we are ready to stop i want you to turn your paper over and write 5 questions that can be answered from your graph if you do not have if you do not have colored pencils markers or crayons please borrow them from somebody around you not from somebody across the room
okay andrew
we are going wait and go to success maker about 1130 okay naya
you probably will not have time but we will see if you if you finish with all of it and your 5 questions raise your hand and let me know we will figure something out martinez why are you spending like $30 on food when i usually buy like cereal milk or bread i plan on treating myself to olive garden with naya so i figured it might cost me a little bit more
no goodness no alright any other questions before we start it is so cute cause any other questions before we start alright you may begin do we just put a circle with percent say that one more time
yeah that is fine right exactly you would not necessarily have to put what the name of it was it is optional see you at olive garden tomorrow
there you go some good sushi i am putting 90 in clothes cause i like clothes that is fine but you have to choose .
how many categories do you have to choose 3 okay choosing a category and putting in a 0 do you think that counts yes no
you do not you do not have to put a lot but you do need to have a 3rd category that has something in it i want to put 5
i want to color that one so hm i want to color this okay
no it has got to be somebody around you nope somebody close to you marcy is not close enough $40
huh
no borrow from somebody borrow from somebody
$20 okay okay
alright what do we got so far add them up for me 10 104078 9100 excellent ooh i have $34 left
i got $0 left excellent you can go ahead and start coloring if you are ready hm what there you go emily is going to help you out there i am done alright cool so let us add them up and make sure 30 50 so do your pie graph 40 .
so 90 so 5090 and hey does not this picture look a little bit like pacman attacking pacman harper you are ready no you are fine i am i am just visually looking at what you are doing to make sure we are on the right math let me get the types 1st perfect you may start coloring i can put ¢24 into movies right how many movies you want yes
yep that works you are exactly right 4627 and you are going to give us that tough math let us see 406666 and 24 would be ooh wait hold on let us see 46 what is this supposed to be it is someone else we could do with the circle
7 and 24 double check it i think we are about 3 off does this have to be neat or can i leave it like that i would like for it to be neat i would like to always see your best work which is usually your neatest work
i can not find my mistake what mistake i did the wrong chart that is supposed to be this is supposed to be at 30% i do not have nothing else that is 20% well i will put something at 20% no that was my games 0 i can change this yeah i would change something to make it so yeah okay i think that would work
good idea
he said i eat nasty food that is wrong he is jealous cause he does not know high quality food what w we understand martinez alright 6075 perfect all right you have got all your percents in you are ready to get started what are we doing he changed the line no
do something else that is we can not do that you are going to make a mess all over the place does that one work that will work
let us see chucky
i i am going to color the happy face okay you can also decorate around the edges yay that would be marvelous i like them both so no which is the .
if you are happy if you are happy me and my brother eat it if i am in a happy mood yeah if i am in a happy mood i am going to go with chili lobster awesome miss name can you take me to olive garden can i take you to olive garden yeah like right now i wish i could that would be nice
i do not like olive garden alright now can i call time out for a 2nd are these are going to be the same blue alright that is going to throw me off let me go get you another one okay cause i messed up would that be okay okay it is next to the sushi spot yeah 0 yeah
thank you you are welcome what you are welcome alright how are we doing bad actually 40102030 beautiful i am coming there next anna alright so you got you have clothes is here
let us see so 10203045 perfect books are where are books okay books are 5 food is 20 movies are where 10 and games are 10 why did we end up with .
an open spot alright let me see you pencil i am not seeing it okay so from here 10203045 okay all of that is clothes right yeah okay and then we have got books books
let us do books here for this 5 then we have food which is 20 up to there so we have from here to here so far right so we have 102030 and you have 30 left that is perfect okay so games is 20 ah i see the games was only at 15 that is why we were missing that 5
alright if we put books here games is how much 2020 so do games from here to here and then movies in there that will work out that is where that extra 5 that is where we were missing it from that makes sense let me check come on yeah she was going to be drowned
huh
okay we are going to go to lunch soon okay if you feel sick let me know okay especially if you need the restroom alright let us see the only thing i would recommend andrew andrew
alright what i would probably do because these are kind of hard to read i would probably have put these off to the side so that they would be easier to read cause you are going to see that done that way a lot on graphs okay very nice alright you okay take a breath do not you have her paper for the you said you what
she said she is a yeah 0 that is on i was just i was just wanting to what you did wrong what would you mess up on i said it is okay but she is not it looks like 2 it looks like 10
yeah we have an extra one you can use that one that is fine can i get water okay you just got water 5 questions about your graph he got a he got to make a make a key yep you need a key and you need a .
how do you got to make a key title key and title please 0 like that 0 what did you mess up on
okay let us let us do this start here and go around okay go ahead
let me see what you do we will make sure you get it right alright so we have got 20 for the food
okay and then 30 for games good keep going movies is 5 so that is going to be to where here yep very good now make me a key down at the bottom so i know what each color represents please missus missus .
let us get stephanie to help you
is not that food the green one let us see what we are doing alright keep going alright so then you have what
and 2020 okay now hold on because here is what you are going to need here is where here is where i think we are getting confused you got to do this 5 huh and then this 10 is going to bring us to what
up to then to here is going to be .
so that is going to be your 20 it is just not going to be it is just not going to end on a whole line this way it is going to end ther perfect okay and then .
alright and then we have what is next toys for 10 thank you again right here you are welcome perfect and then what do you have left savings my voice sounds fun funny savings which is 15 beautiful that is exactly right is this okay miss name i kind went outside the lines
on purpose say that again you know how the sentences that have more than like to subtract what is the difference between the amount of money i would spend on this and the amount of money i would spend on that what is the difference use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea
what now
time out purple yellow orange alright so you got 2 more keep going yes can i go to miss name today i am going to go get some bread for me
no clap clap clap alright i am going to give you about 5 more minutes to finish up what you can what you do not finish in class we will finish for homework but take the next few minutes get as far as you can so that i can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home this are savings this to food i was supposed to do 20 on the games but then i messed up
but then i did fine alright 506070809100 did you just add savings yeah 0 okay that is cool it just threw me off i was like wait a 2nd how did we do that okay i follow you we are good okay so you have 10 for savings 10 for movies movies 10 for games 5 for books and then 40 twen 1020304045 for clothes and 20 for food perfect
that works hold on hold on i am just right here alright so you definitely have a large clothing budget i will need a bigger closet yes okay that will be in your next budget alright here is what i want you to do next excellent job turn it over i want you to ask 5 questions that somebody could answer from your graph okay can i put he loves clothes could they ans .
they actually might be able to answer that from your graph but yeah 5 questions based on your graph
alright let me take a look at it
excellent now flip it over i want you to come up with 5 question that somebody could answer by using your graph okay beautiful i know right like it alright what is the sum of all the data okay good what does the green part of the graph mean what is the .
one moment please what is the least percent how much okay good now would you be able to answer those questions alright go ahead and answer those questions we should be wrapping it up in just a moment is it okay if if i put the questions on here that is fine
yep i see 2 things i am missing what just just one okay so i am missing your title and what else just that what else just that how about .
show me a key
alright so you need a a title and a .
i am finished mar marcy is giving you a hint key and you got 5 questions alright let us take a look yeah you got to write 5 questions do you have any white out no that is okay just put one line through it and then write the word again there you go make sure your name is on it we are just about finished
yes you may
ooh say that again
that is okay there is a .
can i get another sheet of paper no just do it on the back this one is fine i messed it up it is fine no it is fine do it how much more money did i spend on food than clothes but can i say 1st the movies you could say how much more money did i spent on food than clothes and movies altogether nah okay can not i put my fun chart
very colorful it is bright colors jaydon jaydon yes andrea is not in here i can not talk to her yet okay i will talk to her when she gets in here alright 54321
0 go ahead and put your markers crayons down stop where you are at thank you ben thank you max excellent job andrew everything down ready to listen again alright we are going to do one last thing before we leave for success maker i want us to take a look back at our graph
now that we have had a chance to color our own graphs let us try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph who wants to start us off i think there is probably one that is easier than the rest of them that is just my opinion martinez what do you think i think the the blue one is 50 alright why do you think the blue s ladies
why do you think the blue section is 50% cause it is it is half of that okay excellent job it is half we know that 50% and half are the exact same thing so we are going to go ahead and label this section 50% i think that is an excellent estimate andrew do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us the orange one is 25 okay what makes you think the orange one is 25%
say that one more time 4 of those equals 100 excellent job so basically what andrew is saying is that this section is like 14th of the circle and 14th of the circle would be 25% excellent job i would agree with that so how much have i used up so far 75% i have used up 75% so i only have 25% left naya what section do you want to label for us the biographies
biographies is the yellow section what do you think i think it is like small 15 okay yeah 15 because cause b the green and the yellow is 25 so if you take off like a little bit of it .
you are on the right track you are saying it exactly right it is just kind of hard to explain i think what you are i what i am hearing you say is that this section will be 25% so we have to decide if this section is 25% this would have to be like 15 or 20 and this would have to be like 5 or 10 okay what martinez give us what you think it would be i think it is 15 because if you add the green one and the yellow one it equals the same as 25
so half of this is will be 25 too okay so half of 25 is 15 i have got to say i agree with you all is reasoning i think that this is somewhere between 15 and 20% and this is somewhere between 5 and 10% so let us say 15% and 10% now double check let us make sure that we have 100% before we move on 50 and 25 would be 7575 and 10 would be 8585
85 and 15 a 180 a 100 a 100% excellent job alright any questions before we move on naya i know it is an estimate but at 1st i was at least thinking that the green part was 5 okay at 1st glance i am kind of leaning between 5 and 10% and naya brought up a good point this is an estimate okay now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount but for our purposes this is an estimate i am glad that you brought that up again ben
right because it is an estimate if we had done 20% here and 5% here that would also have given us the 25% the most important thing i want you to take from looking at this would we ever said this amount was 45% no no it is not anywhere near half of the circle so that is what i want us to be keeping in mind while we are doing and making our own circle graphs alright excellent job today if you did not finish we will finish it for homework i am going to call groups to line up for success maker
let me get table 5 go ahead and line up
large number landmark in large numbers all right now kirby could you give me a big big large number 1012 now where do you get that is it 1000 a large number or extra large extra large
1000 yeah because our our focus was in how many how much is a 1000 so that is a large number how much is a 1000 how many 10 do we have in a 1000 how many 100 do we have in a 1010 we have 1000
1000 good job 1000 in a 1000 and we did our we did our what did we do to the chart of or book of 1000 all right okay pretty soon pretty pretty soon when we finish that set the section 2 pretty soon today we are going to kind of have people helping people
because some people i walked around the other day and see some people have difficulties completing the last section of unit 2 i mean section 2 the section 2 is really asking you to either add and these vocabularies kirby these vocabularies when you adding they ask you what question look at the vocabularies and tell me what question do they ask you when you are adding
what is the total one and i want somebody else to raise their hand yup the next question could be
no when you add all together how much is it all together or how many by now there is another question when they ask you to either add or take away or subtract see all these vocabulary words subtract now one question ingrid they always ask one question when you need to take away take away add subtract
subtract they ask you that question and we said we learned that you could do it both ways ingrid look at the vocabulary words and tell me which which word do you see more often very often to subtract now yeah when we subtract how many more how many more how many more miles how many more money how much more money so that probably i said 0 maybe i need to add that we learn how to do with both ways
we could add or we could what that means when we landmark in that number and our landmark could be walk forward and or walk if you step back if you know what you are doing and some people show me that in that book when i check it some people say 0 i know what to do and this is the strategy we want you to be able to own that strategy and
see i told you to put your pencil ready all right now these are the things we are going to exp have people
i know yeah what is another word
how much more the word more is the one how much more whatever how much more do we need to get to a 1000 now the things that i would like to introduce today but we are not going to focus on it too much now if we if we if you just turn around for a minute just turn around face back with the place value chart that we have just turn around you do not need to get up just turn around
thank you all right now we have one 10 101 10 100 all right very good i have everyone looking at me then we have 1000 what do we have before that the comma the comma that separates the 1000 we bet on so this is 1000 place and it is
2 no in the 1000 place we have 2 but 10000 100000 10000 100000 let us stop there let us stop there in the 1000 place let us see people who are really paying attention like reggie is doing good his ismael is doing good kirby nick good job

all right now let us see he spent let me see what he spent . see you still did not did not i . i am glad i checked you did not add the decimal 0 it looked like . i did it because of you 0 thank you
let me see and what p p now fix your p please yeah good job did you write your sentence ah did you write your sentence let us see this sentence good job sentence sentence good job sentence can i see good job
some people will do let me see ingrid good job dollar sign dollar sign good job now why do the last question asks you what 0 this is too easy yeah yeah can i see if you do a good job probably did not huh no no do we have dollar sign in there no
see now kirby is adding dollar sign where he does not you need to pay attention now let us find another money money another money problem money problem that kind of give people a hard time
what page 0 there is one there is one
there is one page 26 26 let us go on page 26 good job everyone page 26 another money where and we will see number 4 about the decimal 3 things now let us put down 3 things we learn about money problem money money problem what do we do rebecca rebecca rebecca i need your help 0 okay 3 things 3 things so money let us put down money problem 1st of all with that dollar sign good job
money problem we need we need to be careful or be careful and i will just put money problem be careful be careful we are not remember
decimal now remember remember let us put it in a sentence if you want to put it . remember in your learner is notebook today i rebecca control it
remember
the sense you have to remember okay now let us raise our hand you are very happy today reggie
all right now reggie tell me one thing number one reggie we need to remember ah reggie one thing we need to remember when we are doing money problem and then we are going to go over decimal sign decimal sign do not forget decimal sign decimal decimal is decimal a sign no it is end it is end decimal is called end end so could i put decimal and or decimal is also and when you are reading it
so reading number 2 all right now let me wait for let me wait for juliana juliana yes juliana number 2 so we need to remember decimal to add decimal add decimal and it is end the dollar sign
do not do not forget to add and do not forget when you are doing dollar sign dollar sign see i just put it dollar sign and then i forgot to read
are you talking without raising your hand or thank you ingrid number 3 now excuse me number 3 yes
no no we said decimal all right
hold on she asked me a question and it is maya that remind us decimal could be read as end end and this is something sometimes we skip it or we forget $5 and $5 and and $25 and you mean a and d and yeah or d and no not the end but and
and mean +and yeah
plus the cents for example 2.49 $2.49 and we could read could be read as $2 and 40 and see the and $48 and 45 and ¢49 good job good job all right now something we need reggie 3rd things we learn do not forget to add the dollar sign
do not forget to add the decimal and the cents and the cents and the same sign yeah but once you put the dollar sign mean you know where to add it how about line or column line them in column yeah because line sometimes you get confused you get messed up
the comma the comma okay then no we are talking about decimal but if it is a comma comma too but line up line up what what do we line up for given numbers the numbers line up numbers so sometimes i put this sign for numbers reggie again yeah huh sometimes i put that sign for numbers all right look at that you are supposed to know how subtracting or adding
now that is one thing that is in the problem but we are talking about after we add or subtract then things we need to remember things we need to remember 11 add the decimal after we excuse me as we are adding or after we are adding check back see did i add so these are did i
you could call it did i did i did i all right add the decimal add the dollar sign and line up the numbers correctly correctly
line correctly mister jimmy all right hold on
dollar dollar operation yeah yep when you put 05 decimal and you put ¢0.5555 yep but you add a 0 next to 5 thank you that is another thing but 3 important things you say when you finish did i when i say revise your math rebecca when i say revise your math these are the things i say especially if it is money yeah
if it is money now let us go on page 2626 we are on 26 okay very good so did people get this i see people are taking notes for their
learners learners okay so things you learned today 123 ah now let us see if daphka is with us on page 26 i am good job and i see yes yeah you are on page 26 yeah okay now can you read for us nick
close one of the starting problem above use it to solve this problem okay so is it a money problem yeah yes okay so what is the money what did they ask you to do the one on top rebecca i can not really work if you are talking you are not raising your hand you can not talk to your neighbor and we need your participation now that i am going to take away
no no no notes away notes away notes away no no i do not want that no notes away yeah okay nick is the one that is reading and he is going to help us on the top this is 9 94 $5 so they said this one they call it a starter problem
so what is the starter problem starter mean what shirley what does starter mean do not want you to go through stuff thank you it is a beginning or it is a start problem and that problem could help you solve the next one how many people understand that the starter mean yes they give me a problem to start with or they give me something that i could look up to now what is the starter problem juliana 0 i got you wrong juliana what is the starter
the starter problem tell me the starter problem is a problem no no you do not need to repeat just tell me what is it on page 26 that we are going to start with it is a money problem it is a money problem $9949 $5 $9 and i put the dollar sign do not forget 994
$909949 and 94 yes $9.94 cents thank you 9 and 94 $5 one person please 11 rebecca rebecca you are not really helping us if you are not really wait for your turn to talk rebecca yes now turn to me and kind of help us
mister jimmy $5 $5 so it is just 5 yeah $5 how do i write $5 00 no no 5 that is and ¢0 and ¢0 ¢0 ¢0
9 +0 +99 +0 you have to put a 4 right there a decimal thank you very much nick see people who are paying attention watch my mistake sometimes i am saying something i do not even see and reggie did not even see what i did reggie fix yourself
14 so it is 14
so it is 14 wow it is $14 dollars that is the thing we should not forget to do ..
did not they say $9 $5 so it is $14 now how does this starter problem will help now let me wait for rebecca rebecca is really up yeah they give me 2 more starting problems rebecca rebecca yes now what is the next problem they give me the next problem is to choose one of the 3 problems above and use it to solve this problem that they give you i know but what is the next
$9 wait a minute we did this one no that is it it is the same okay $9.94 $5.16 that is not the next one that is not the next one that is the next one fine $9 $5 we did that no $9 $5
so how is this going to help $9 $9 $4 so we take away the 94 thank you all right is not that easy
thank you
thank you so what do i do and she said we take away yeah we take away the 94 and one so we take away 194 and that gives us what only $5 left is it take away it is addition take away it is addition
thank you but that is $5 this is a 5 yes it was $14 it is just $14 so it is only
this is so easy this is easy
so let us see who will get
now okay everybody seems to get it let us see if they really choose it is a dollar sign okay i just now i am glad you are the one telling me now i am going to walk around and see let us see choose one of the starter above to do this one right
one of the starter to do this one right see i still see good job good job now you have not done this one all right work on this one all right ismael sit down let us see ismael is working . did you do this one it is plus
okay ooh now could you give her a hand she does not get it you have not done this one you know you could all right shirley could you give her a hand sure let us see let us see can i see
no i know 15 okay we will find some more things to 0 good job that is not true
she was covering too i am already done okay i did not do that one all right okay that is you do not have to you do not need to do this one i can help you all right now listen 2526 that is what we did i want you to check 27 check 27 and 2827282728
272827282728 good job let us see 27 it is the 1st number on this is very and you have to time it by 10 by 10 time by 10 or base 10 all right sit down let me see base 10
27 good job see you have not done now why are you doing this for me yeah what is up with me we need you to do math now i want you to see you did not finish this could you help him with this good job for a minute that is fine mister jimmy okay help him you may turn over now wait here
you may turn over give him a hand right here and right there when i come back i am going to check and see thank you reggie a ¢100 is a dollar right yeah so if you can not but why do not you put why do not you put the dollar you did not put the dollar sign sign the dollar sign 0 that is 11 no dollar sign good job
and where is the decimal that we talked about decimal where is the decimal it is a dollar one one so it is one it is right behind the one thank you good job now if you add a dollar to $14 you get $15 and there is ¢10 left i got a pen no this one she did this one did she do a good job there she did not do the 1st one
okay so do the 1st one let us see people who are really see i am taking this i am really taking it i need to ask see he did not do it can you help see i know how to do it i just did not do it because i was working my 1000 but do not worry no you are not doing this we need you 0 you did this
0 you also did this okay good very good so you may do the other 10 my god rebecca could you check with daphka and see if she really gets it sure thank you no you do not need to bring it just check daphka daphka rebecca is going to give you a little bit of help
do you really need i really do not huh
thank you one minute good job
let us see reggie and yep kirby kirby kirby in your seat one minute
yeah no i will just put them together yeah that is fine okay how is ingrid doing she is good okay good how is ismael doing good job
decimal decimal is there a decimal there now
can i go to the bathroom what okay good helpers good friend thank you very much good job good job victoria good job thank you and then we will all right good helpers friend helping friends
reggie sit down sit sit sit sit we are done all right so next time okay shirley thank you rebecca thank you let us check together all right let us see let us see
you kids over there all right i need your attention good job reggie now nick thank you reggie now could you tell us what he did not get what he did not get that he could not do it you think he gets it yeah he does so what help what help did you give him
what kind of help did you give him rebecca rebecca rebecca i need you to listen to him yeah all right hold on hold on we are really some people are not listening let us wait for rebecca again thank you
good job now we are sharing what kind of help did that person need so that person gets it and moves on because it is easy we all know but some people miss a few victoria i need your help when it is time to do our final sharing coming together see what we learned
so tell us again i helped with this and showed the numbers that he can not add 0 he could not add a few numbers and did he get it he can not add he could not but now he could listen reggie now he can now he gets it all right how about somebody else
he did not know how to use to break it apart break it apart just to use another problem to help solve the other problem good job all right because that one asked you to use the starter problem to help all right let us wait for reggie again because when one is talking we need to have everyone listening
so she kind of helped her with use that starter problem they already did for you to start you to get you started and then use it to solve the next problem which is similar but they make it a little bit different right yes all right how about you shirley
she had money and she did not know how to break the numbers the numbers okay now ingrid did you learn something yes okay what did you learn now add the money yes but i do not know the way you were talking i thought you knew
when i looked at the 1st problem we did about money you told us so much that was helpful so how do you feel now not better 0 you need you will probably next time i will have i understand good job all right now one thing maggie maggie yes we are talking here we need you she got the things but she just needed somebody to check them good job
so you checked the dollar yeah yeah did you the dollar and because she is kind of the decimal she is kind of like keep on forgetting about them but all the answers are right very good how do you feel daphka you get okay so the thing that we learned today what one now we need kirby to tell us one number one when you number one do you need your paper for that
no number one today i learned no no you do not need to make it simple just number one now ismael ismael we need you we need you to sit down i learned about large number huh i know but we did not stay and say . hm hm what did you learn about large number i do not know what is the number i wanted to are you reading are you reading for him no no no now large number what did you learn about large number
what did we do we did we broke it apart all right hold on hold on some people are not willing we broke it apart i have a problem we got to the 1000 no no large number what did we do 1st we reviewed a few things what did we review what did we review about large number reggie how many 1000s in 1000 thank you thank you yeah how many 1000s in 10000 in 1000
how many 1000s in 1000 10000 and how many 100 in 10s on 10000 how many 10s on 10000 thank you that is just she is still talking you know what you tell me sorry so many times and i hear your voice and when we are doing our final sharing i want everybody to go home and tell their parents thank you thank you what we learned now what else
so large number that is what we reviewed and you were telling me i remember you told me yeah 1000 is a large number yeah so we learned now how about the vocabularies
all right hold on let us wait if juliana wants to tell me i am waiting and everybody is getting there what else you do not need your paper okay you can not all right go ahead how about the vocabularies
now can you tell something about more more how many like how may more how many more are similar yes whatever it could be miles it could be money it could be cookies it could be anything when they ask you how many more and we could add or we could take away to figure it out all right but it is your own strategy that counts one things exactly
0 i know how to do it people tell me a lot of times 0 i will do it this way i will do it that way how about ingrid that person the other thing that we have learnt huh is when you do your money problem hold on hold on somebody is talking in the back what do you need to put in a money problem like a decimal point decimal point in the money problem do not forget something we should never forget decimal dollar sign
decimal decimal line up numbers line up numbers line up numbers correctly correctly so you could when you add in the decimal that is a vocabulary also all right that is a vocabulary wait so what would be the word there are many vocabulary words we do not even put up there yeah so which one do you say we should have put up there
no no do not how many how many more how many more what is the difference
yeah yeah the sooner we get math done the sooner we get through everything else the more chance that free time starts at 2.35
you might by that time free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45 no no that that is good that means you get extra free time 0 see it means you get extra free time that is a good thing all right shhh is it looking at you right now okay yes the camera is on we are going to try to pretend it is not here please counting down from 5 4 3 2 you shush
you shush too i am going to pick 5 prize winners today and they are going to get to pick from the prize box and the 1st person i pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box so it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can all right 20 seconds right as many yes as many tickets raise your hand when you have something to say yes jamari did not i get picked out yes you can pick later for that too did i get picked out
no thomas and jamari okay so let us get started so that we can get to work on all right somebody want to read our objective for today i do josea what is our objective for today students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly polygon okay stop there students will be able to determine what does determine mean again someone raise their hand raise their hand what does determine mean again
jamari to do okay something else to learn maybe to to learn okay answer no and you need to not call out what does det lala determine mean to know the word of what it is to figure it out right
to decide to figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon right anyone know what a polygon is do you know hold on to it though do not tell us yet do you know all right write it down on piece of paper for me
because i want to know that you knew and you will get extra points for that you know where they are you can write it down now what we are going to start with is i want you to see is that our homework ms jensen this is not your homework is not that homework okay i know this is listen listen
i know what a polygon looks like this is one minute off of free time shut up shut up man i i understand that it is different having a video camera in here but it is staring right at me you know what miguel then move your seat
can i switch with somebody then
why there you go can i just face go now again guys this is a video camera no big deal okay pretend it is not here let us have our normal math lesson okay and ms you know what is funny what we usually do not act like that since when we are doing math when the camera is not here
exactly no well well that is what i am saying this is not how we normally act during math so let us try to make it normal pretend it is not even here okay okay now we are going to talk about no okay all the talking guys come on it is a camera it is not
i will wait no one is even talking you know what guys i will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether if somebody is talking and is not supposed to i will take care of that
no is it the 11th that is you today is 11th do not worry about putting the date on i just want you to look at this for a 2nd 0 this did not get turned on please do not whistle so sorry but there is a camera okay and again camera should not make any difference done
no does not have to be green close to never mind
i said i am saying hello okay and of course we have technical difficulties what if we press that button i do not know which way is it on jamari when it has the orange or when it does not when it has the green when it has the green on that little circle thing okay when there is like a light coming right here yeah okay sit sit sit sit it is red okay so let us wait and see if it comes on or not
okay freeze it is coming on okay hit the 1st 2 lights please no it is not yes it is how do you know okay you guys are right again wait a 2nd yeah just 2 just half no the other half no no no flip them
there that is what i want thank you no so boring you know what okay sorry sorry you are not going to be famous okay all right until i get this on let us take a look at the paper in front of you we have polygons
polygons they are shapes it is the corner i did not ask about the corners i want you to look at the paper looking at the paper okay the top 3 shapes they are telling us that those are polygons okay and the bottom 3 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so what i want you to do while i get this fixed is i want you to look and try to figure out do not say it out loud think in your head what is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons in your head only that is not a polygon no in your head only i am not going to answer that question right now guys circle it that is not a polygon no i am right now i can not spell right now
i know ms jensen maybe the plug is not working the kind of plug 0 you know what 0 wait the thing is not on xavier you get 10000 points that might be the problem that is not what
hey he did not do that because he saw the plug unplugged all right everybody stand up mommy everybody stand up ms jensen he is talking about my mom jumping jacks 15 of them let us go ms jensen he is talking about my mom i will take care of it
do not worry about it okay now everybody look at the camera make a funny face stay right here we are in your seat okay now sit down okay okay come on now sit down now we need to forget that it is even there
okay now i will wait
yeah i do okay maybe the battery maybe it is the plug up up there hold on a 2nd yes can we pause this
only because i am having major technical difficulties with my board and so the kids are all silly anyway we could turn it back on in a 2nd i just okay let us fix so someone let us start and somebody read our content objective again me again students can students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon polygon or not a polygon
okay so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon okay and we just said that we that determine means to figure out or decide so we are going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or is not a polygon okay now someone read the language objective xavier students 0 wait students will be able to define a polygon
students will be able to define a polygon okay so not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or is not a polygon but before you can do that you have to know what a polygon is right i have heard of it before you have heard of it before anybody else heard of it before nope no okay well we are going to talk about them today the paper in front of you and up here has 3 shapes that they are telling us are polygons okay and the bottom 5 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so the 1st thing i want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons what might be the same about them i am not going to ask you to share it yet i do not want you to share it yet but i want you to think about it because i am going to give you another sheet in a minute and you are going to work with a partner next to you
to try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons okay so do you understand what i said richard yeah repeat what i said for me please repeat what i said you are going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons okay and you are going to work with a partner to do so
so take a look at these again and notice what they have in common those top 3 notice what they have in common not going to take comments i want to see how you guys do working this out on your own with your partner and and the bottom ones you are going to figure out why are they not polygons what is different from the ones on top okay
so i am going to have richard nathan and jamari work together as a trio i will take care of you in a 2nd xavier xavier you are going to work with josea and what you are going to do is if you think this shape is a polygon you are going to write a p on it if you think this shape is not a polygon you are going to write an n on it for not okay so you are determining if it is a polygon or not
can i do this one too nope because that already tells you they already tell you there that is your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon isaiah and justin together please miguel and thomas together please marvin and isaiah together please you know what we work with partners as we are assigned in this class and you get rewarded when you work with no he is not you are not going to start trouble are you what am i doing you are working with marvin
okay umm look at me marvin work with isaiah please okay you know what isaiah can you bring your seat over here and work with no you are working by yourself if you do not work with him let us go isaiah bring a chair over here thomas and miguel isaiah is going to work with you too okay
now did you hear what i said before you came back in did you hear what i said hey do you know what you are doing what is the matter what is the matter can you work with thomas at least or you do not want to work with thomas ms jensen could i take a 5 minutes break what is going on in here today
isaiah bring your desk next to thomas mister gomez could you work with thomas and isaiah please
x c a star this is not one 2 so do we cross it out nope you write p if it is a polygon you write n if it is not a polygon all right n well did you talk to your partner did you decide what makes a polygon and what does not yeah all right if it is a polygon are you guys talking to each other what makes a polygon what does not make a polygon
i think a polygon is fully shaped fully shaped okay this is not a polygon okay well talk to your partners about that tell them i do not want you to just write something down i want you to talk about it
thomas you asked for another pencil right no you did not you asked for a break you did not ask for a pencil you asked for a break right no i did not hear you thomas so n if it is not a polygon p if it is now do we agree yeah
with nathan too yeah that every one of them is the same he is not even done how could it be the same you guys need to talk to him ms jensen i am done ms jensen i am done all right hold on to it hold on to it we are going to do a little activity with this in a 2nd
no it does not matter but does look it like it ms jensen we do not know what polygons are yes right and we have not done the definition so that is okay if you do not get it correct but i want you to look and see if you can think of something that these shapes here have in common that these shapes do not have and then find the ones that have the same things in common on your sheet okay these 2
well there you go so those would be polygons ms jensen yes i got my name so small okay that is fine
make sure you and xavier have the same answers and i am going to tell you in a minute no worries if it is polygon you put the one
okay that is a polygon i am asking you it is not there no it does not that is just that is cool right it says polygon and then it says not a polygon i am sorry if i confused you it means we are going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that are not that is so easy that is my name right here okay to your seat i do not get it they are the same thing
no no no no no no no no okay i am sorry ignore what is up here so far this has nothing to do with whether it is a polygon or not
i know and that is my bad guys that is my bad ignore what is up here okay i was getting ready for our next step xavier your seat is over here please be in it xavier not in 5 minutes right now but they are doing them wrong xavier listen to me
you know what it is not your business to tell them that they are wrong sit down josea you 2 need to stay in your seats all right eyes up here eyes up here did some of us i will wait no point of arguing
okay now the reason are you guys done isaiah and justin have you finished no okay hurry up and finish you got 30 more seconds or actually bring it back to your seats where you were that is fine you can finish it after i want to talk about the next step so i confused some of you
i confused some of you and rightfully so because what i did was i drew 2 circles on the board and i put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other but what this means is we are going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet and the ones that are a polygon we are going to put inside this circle and the ones that are not a polygon we are going to put inside that circle so i am not telling you this is a polygon this is not a polygon so that is why you were confused
and it is good to be confused it means you were paying attention okay means you were paying attention no it does not yes it does i will wait 3 2 before it comes up 3 times one xavier xavier yeah please put that down
now what do you want to tell me okay you can tell me in a 2nd then because i am going to give this marker out for a 2nd and i am going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that is on your paper and put it in the right circle so for example you could choose number one and if you think it is a polygon draw it in the polygon circle if you think it is not a polygon draw it in the not a polygon circle
the one thing i am going to say is let us draw them about this size so that we have enough room okay all right we do not want them real giant because we need enough room we want them big enough so everyone can see them you can tell me in 12nd so miguel not right this 2nd who would like to put a polygon or not a polygon up there yes is this it or this not i want to you had a chance
what do you need
do not worry okay is that big yeah that is a perfect size i do not think i read it right now the one thing i am going to ask is make sure because i know the figure that he is drawing is like this right it comes down all the way let us make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that
so jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon thank you okay so jamari says this is a polygon okay if you disagree with him when it is your turn you can put a question mark inside his polygon
if you say nah that is not a polygon that is not a polygon then you could come up i am not saying it is wrong okay but you could come up and you could put a question mark inside okay and that can be your turn
you can do the next one richard thank you for your enthusiasm you know what enthusiasm means no your excitement all right so richard draw us a polygon or not a polygon i am not even doing nothing do you know what you are yes i know josea you have had how many good days in a row like the whole week almost right
do you want to really blow it now no no so make some good choices for me okay yes yes can i go next possibly hold on all right so richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite right it is open and it has a line that goes further down he says that is not a polygon all right isaiah
we will see you are going to write with a pencil go ahead draw me one that is either a polygon or not a polygon move your desk over a little bit please a bit more than that he will get a chance everybody is going to get a chance
okay good stay there you can bring your paper with you if you are afraid you are going to forget what it looks like
that is all right uhh while he is doing that does anyone have a polygon they would like to put up i would josea you had a chance right but everybody is going to get a chance 1st what is that a diamond no or here turn this over it is a square i need you looking at this
it this a square or is it not no we will talk about it we will talk about it we will talk about it we are not going to argue over what a shape is or is not right now that is perfect and they are not going to look exactly like they look in the picture what you can do umm where is that marker please wait why did you give him the marker
what number was yours josea mine yep what do you mean number look at your sheet what number is it 9 what number is yours jamari mine is one we will put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape what number was yours what number was this it was 2 no that one is 2 that one is 2 okay
that way we are all talking about the same shape okay isaiah would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon in your opinion or one that is not a polygon not okay go ahead not is over here do i have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon i know hand up only
all right justin put the number up there too okay so you are saying that is a polygon okay what number is it
number 8 we are discussing the paper what number is that we are discussing it okay okay this one i got one hold on do you have one that is not a polygon i do
that is not a polygon i got one right yeah no i do not know which one have not you done one already let us let everyone have a chance 1st do you have one that is not a polygon ms jensen hold on does anybody else wants wants a turn that has not had a turn i do i do i do i do you just did one right nathan you want a turn do you have one that is not a polygon
uhh no do you have one that is a polygon okay can i do it yeah thank you
not a polygon please yeah it belongs in there please
no he messed up he did something wrong he has got the extra okay well copy it right off the paper he has the paper in front of him he can fix it that looks like a state or something on the map it looks nothing like mpas where does it come out
okay what number is that you forgot to write the number you are not showing no no no because all right let us take a look at
please do not crinkle that all right let us take a look up here i know there is some that we have not gotten up there but i want to see if we can come up with some rules that we think makes a polygon a polygon or makes a polygon or makes something not a polygon i am going to wait till everyone is sitting though and ready ms jensen you need to sit down okay
now yes all right go put it up quick the the marker is already up there does anybody have a question i do about someone is up there thatt hey think ah i do not agree i do not agree i either think this is a polygon or i think it is not a polygon i think they got it mixed up
go put a question mark jamari in one that you think 3 of them okay go put the question marks in them put that away now why because it is not time to draw it is time to do math yes it is
why you know the rules richard
hold on do you have more that go up there or do you have a question about one all right the way we are going to start xavier huh we are we are discussing if the right but right now i need you up here please okay thank you
i appreciate that you are talking about math but right now we are going to have a whole group discussion about math okay well isaiah is finishing up up there i want your 1st thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not i want your 1st thoughts about polygons okay
is there something that you notice about those 1st 3 polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have excuse me yes that the ones the 31s on the top are like regular shapes like square a star
so you are saying that they are regular shapes okay all right well are not these regular shapes here too though yeah okay anybody have anything else that when they 1st look at these they think hey i know what these polygons might have in common i know one what is that richard
what they have to be together they have to be together so richard is saying they have to be together sure what do you mean by together okay so what richard is saying is that this is not together okay
whereas this is together all of the line segments meet okay now richard when we talk about that in math when we talk about a shape like this that does not meet and a shape like this that does meet we are talking about a closed shape or an open shape
okay now a closed shape all the line segments and it is hard sometimes with this of course it is not going to even look like that but it is difficult sometimes with the pen but miguel i can take care of it myself thank you
now an open shape could look something like this right do we see the difference this part of it is left open this it is all closed all the line segments meet each other okay so we could say that polygons richard is theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes richard
are they open or closed closed closed i do not know why that is coming out red but so you know what not the time to talk about field trip right now and crayons go away no it is not time to color we are looking for characteristics of polygons
in math when we are talking about characteristics we are talking about attributes if i was talking about jamari one of the characteristics i could use to describe him is that he is kind and he is gentle all right he is a good friend those are characteristics that would describe jamari right what we are doing now is we are coming up with characteristics that describe polygons okay
another word for characteristics is attributes so what attributes do polygons have okay how would we describe polygons i could describe jamari as tall kind gentle right how would i describe a polygon one way we are thinking to describe a polygon is that it is a closed wait a 2nd 12nd that it is closed okay that it is a closed figure okay
and we know that that means all the the sides are even okay this needs to be recalibrated but closed i did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot i did not give up i am just going to recalibrate it after math is over
then we will be able to do it now so do you see how all 4 sides meet yeah that makes it a closed figure so a polygon is a closed figure can you give me something else that is an attribute you think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons miguel male the sides have to meet the sides have to meet miguel says
what do you mean by that everything meets like in the corner ms jensen sides meet at corners ms jensen
okay ms jensen okay saying that excuse me wait no i am talking to miguel right now saying sides meet at corners miguel is different from lines of symmetry okay saying that sides meet at corners here we have sides meeting at corners right here we have sides meeting at corners one corner 2345 corners right
okay but that is different from lines of symmetry on 1st look there would not be any lines of symmetry to this figure okay so that is okay it is good thinking and this is actually you are on the right track here okay but i do not want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it does not really have to do with that okay yes sides meet at corners okay the lines are even so all the lines are even
let us look at not all but some yeah okay so if we are not saying all and we are saying some do you think it has to mean are any of the lines do the shape are like even like this this is a polygon right this has the same height of this and then this .
okay so you are showing me so you are showing me on this paper here you are saying that this one has equal sides right yeah okay but here is my question does this one have equal sides no but they are telling us this is a polygon so this might have equal sides but it does not seem like you have to have equal sides does it no
so that is something that some polygons might have but we are looking for things that all polygons are going to have okay good thinking though nathan uhh pointy they all have points okay so you are saying it begins with an a no problem you are saying she has been up for a minute because rocky needed the bathroom but she wants me to brush her hair
do you have our spray right up there okay so these polygons here umm what was the question repeat repeat what you said nathan 0 they all have points okay what do we call this when we are talking about math what do the corners corners okay we are getting some great math vocabulary words here
sides corners does anyone know and i used this word before this might be a new one for you what it is called when we have a straight line the part of a straight line what we call that line segment line segment all right
so we can say about polygons that they have sides right that are made of what line segments all the polygons have lines right which are straight okay that makes a line right
so they all have line segments so sides are line segments now let us get back to what nathan said he said that they have corners okay we said that the sides meet at corners right so we know that they have sides that are line segments that they meet at the corners okay
anyone know the math term for when 2 line segments meet like that to form an angle what we call it right angle vertical they are called vertices okay where 2 line segments meet and make angle are called vertices okay running out of room
fit that s in here you know miguel i am glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes lie 0 no i am telling you the truth now now you have to walk all the way over there that is okay that is okay i can handle it now so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure the sides meet at corners
okay and that the sides are line segments okay that is a good list that is a very good list can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that 1st page here sorry have that in common can we agree that they have corners yes vertices
that they are line segments that meet at those corners
wait and that they are all closed figures yes all right let us look at our not jamari is very excited that he was right now let us hold on now not polygons let us think of our list all right closed figure
they are always open open figure they are always open no no corners no corners meet okay so let us look at this if we have as our 3 characteristics i am going to write inside of this okay because this is polygons we have closed line segments vertices and vertices
and i am abbreviating okay we know it means that they all have line segments as their sides that those line segments meet i got one in the corners which are vertices and that it is a closed shape hold on no hold on i want to show you something with this okay tell me let us look at this is this a closed figure no no because we have what
what this big line segment here right that is extending out from this vertice okay so we know this is not a polygon what is wrong with this now this is closed it has a line segment this vertice but not really right because what cut in half but not really because what are these line segments no
is this a line segment no yeah no a line segment is straight okay a line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this this is what this is if it is not straight it is circle not a circle oval it is not an oval but what is the what is the .
the line here is not straight so it is not a line segment it is curved right so we do not have line segments there so we know this is not a polygon what about this it is crooked it is crooked it is crooked it is not that it is crooked because this is a straight line one side is bigger than the other this is a straight line one is bigger than the other okay let us go back to let us go okay no hold on
i want to go back to our 3 attributes that we came up with so far closed line segments and vertices does it have corners where it meets yes okay so it has that does it have line segments yes is it a closed figure not really no no in order to be closed well .
yes let me let me take that back because we missed and this is my bad we missed part of line segments the thing about polygons my fault is that the thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices but they do not cross they never cross
okay so they never cross that is the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon okay those line segments never cross so what is the problem with this one it crosses it crosses that is the problem with this one is that it crosses okay so that is not a polygon what is the problem with the 4th one down there on the bottom
it is not closed it is not closed what is the problem here it is 2 shapes right it is not one shape right now is this shape if we took this triangle away is that a polygon if we took this square away is that a polygon yes but put them together they are not polygons right okay great job great job let us go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see
let us take a look at what we put up here is this a polygon yes yep consensus is this a polygon yes yes is this a polygon yes is this a polygon yes no no that is curved thank you it is curved they are not line segments right wait so no no we already did that one over there right no what about this
no okay is it closed yes does it have straight lines that do not cross does it have straight lines that do not cross yeah does the do they meet at vertices do they all meet at corners yeah is it a polygon no yeah is it a polygon no why not tell me why not prove it that it is not it is because i look kind of crooked it no these are in order you are getting confused
in order for a line to be straight it does not mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way it can be any way it just can not be curved okay so xavier is this closed yes is are they line segments that do not cross yes are they do they have vertices yeah is it a polygon yes yes let us go to let us go to not a polygon
is this not a polygon yeah correct how about this one why is it not a polygon it is a polygon because it has straight lines it has straight lines what else and it has line segments okay it has line segments that do not cross it has corners and it is closed this is a polygon so who put the question mark up here jamari jamari did you
you were right jamari that is well i should not put a correct mark because this is a polygon okay so you were right to question it how about this one number 10 here isaiah you put this one up right not a polygon tell me you think it is not a polygon tell me why you think it is not a polygon isaiah because it does not have the the even sides it is curved yeah it is curved okay so you were right on this how about this here
that is right this is not a polygon right it is not a polygon what is wrong with this one that has crooked like the lines okay take crooked take crooked out of your vocabulary right there is no corner here right so this is right you were right it is not a polygon okay number 12 that is not a polygon i want to take a look at that i did number 12 okay you did number 12
why is it not a polygon because it it is not even what do you mean it is not even one of the sides is shorter than the other side did we say that the sides have to be equal over here no we have we said that the sides have to be line segments that do not cross are there any line segments that cross in that yeah where no no no no is it a closed figure or an open figure i was right on that one too closed yes you were
is it a closed figure or an open figure closed do they meet at corners do the line segments meet at corners is this a polygon yes this is a polygon you know what it is okay when we were i want you to remember that when we were doing this we did not even know the definition of a polygon okay we did not even know so let me ask you a question let us go
okay camera is now on it is 11 30 december 13 this is math class so recording is in progress okay let me have your attention please boys and girls put the books away and get your folder ready and your notebook as well as your box
so last week we have been exploring volume right and volume of a rectangular prism so can someone just tell us and or remind us how you have how we found the volume okay of this box or this rectangular prism we multiply the length by width by the height okay so we figured out one way to do this it was to multiply the length the length the width the width and then the height
okay so that was one way to find right and we all tried that okay what is another is there another way to find this dylan the bottom of the surface times the height can you speak up please the bottom of the surface times the height the bottom of i think the bottom of the surface the surface here you said yeah okay so surface for example this one has 5 across and 4 this way so what does that mean the surface has 41
20 squares and if you were to put cubes you can put 20 cubes right the bottom layer huh and why do you multiply by 3 dylan because that is the height because that is the height that is the 3 layers right so if you were to take apart the 3 layers then you have 3 layers of cube any other ways that we tried or you tried no
okay so last time you made this box and this is box one and we did volume and i think everyone i would say everyone did very well on the test on friday in terms of finding volume
okay so i do not think anyone had a problem finding volume and maybe there is a couple of problems with other things being careless you know for example the pattern that you miscount or miscalculated and then you something else just being careless but in terms of volume and i think you had no problem doing that so today we are going to shift into something not volume but similar
well i should not say similar to volume but something that we can use this box to find to help us to start okay and that is called a surface area okay so today we are going to explore finding the surface area of an object of a rectangular prism
okay so just write down surface area and what does that look like to you the word surface area what does that sound like what do you think it means alphonsus okay so the surface like you know this board has a surface right the floor has a surface but what about area what about what is area
selina so area is the number of
okay you remember this right okay so area that is the number of square units right of an area for example this floor you can count the number of squares the number of tiles
this board if we put a grid here then you can also count the number of squares okay so does that have to do with the inside does that have to do with cubes if we are just looking at the surface no think about it okay we are thinking of we are looking at surface so if we all right why did you say no louis
maybe because it is not finding the whole prism okay it is not the whole prism but it is just the surface so for example if you just look at the surface of this how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box 4 maybe 24 there are 24 squares right because it is 6 by 4 yeah and what about the surface of this
the bottom of this box how many squares do you see 4 are not they the same yeah yes these are the same so can i say that they have the same surface or the area 0 yes okay are the same now but if you look at the 2 boxes do they hold the same number of cubes no no so can i say that the volume is different okay yeah
this one versus this one but what about the surface just the bottom we are just looking at the bottom yeah same right so area is the same but volume is different so if we look at the surface are we looking at the inside you know how many cubes it can fit no it can fit in here no okay we are just looking at the surface okay so for example this paper has a surface
and you can see the number of squares here right okay but if i turn it this way suppose you can look at the paper that is flat from this angle do you see any are you supposed to you know if this is 2 dimensional you are not supposed to see any height right okay but it has a surface but there is no volume and last week i think we said that volume has to do with what kind of objects
the shape the 3 dimensional 3 dimensional solids 3 dimensional solids right dylan so i want you to remember this boys and girls and as we find the area or the surface we are not going to think about the volume okay so
0 just momentarily no problem so what was i saying the volume okay when we look at the surface area we are not going to think about volume okay so what you are going to do is to create a box that looks like this but this time i am going to give you a grid that looks like this instead of the pattern
you will have to figure out the pattern okay for making this and you just draw it and cut it out and make a box okay the size of this all right and this is the same as the 1st one that you made last week before you added okay now after that okay pay attention please
okay after that you are actually going to use this as a cover and this is a box so you cover this box and now it is a rectangular prism right okay so again we are not looking at volume so not the inside but only on the outside the surface okay so let me just .
let me just help you start by looking at one of the surface one of the sides so let us say the box you know it is like this simon okay now let us say this is the top okay i just call it the top and that is the bottom right sides front back okay
so okay how can we find the surface or the area of this front this top side jackie measure length from width length
okay that is 6 centimeters 6 units and then 4 units this way so how many 33 units there are 24 not just units but square units okay
so 6 times 4 ah square units okay does that make sense so now we took care of the top okay and then what other sides
how many sides are there in a rectangular prism how many different sides 3666 right 66 top bottom 12 front back 34 side side 56 okay
so what you are going to do is you will make this box 1st and then i want you to write okay the top area figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom the area of the front side area of the back side the side one of the sides and then the other side okay so once we have all 6 of those what does that mean
we have found all the surfaces right all the sides and then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism we add em up we add all the edges up you just add everything up and then you have the total surface area okay of this okay so why do not i have you start by making the top
so this is for pattern pattern for box one . okay yeah people will hook them
we have like 15 and then can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way thank you okay does everyone have one you need one more yes so use a pencil to to make the pattern
okay so make sure you count carefully ..
okay can you stop for a minute jackie okay so how many squares across how many units if you count from here how many 4 square units how many 4 right square units how about this way from here to here is it also 4 square units yes
so is this going to match huh you make okay you need to make a pattern that is this size right okay and only one layer one unit high okay all right very good very good very good
no that is 25s you all set judy
not yet . why are you making another one louis because i messed it up
0 so here you just cut the corner is that right yeah okay that is fine you can do another one what are you looking for tape tape just tape the top and you do not have to tape the lid you know the cover okay
yeah just tape the side so you can cover this
okay now that is the same as this okay who is using duct tape so how boys how do you think we can find the area okay do you remember we talked about this or the surface area of this whole rectangular prism
just find out the area that had this part or this part right
okay do you agree with that wait simon the area we are looking at
no you add this 20 +24 +18 okay simon can you say that again what do you mean they share because like right here if you put the cube in right this square and this square are the same square so they are part of the same cube yes
so we can not count them twice but remember what we said are we working with cubes okay we are not doing cubes anymore and this time simon it is just the surface just the surface okay just the surface so this has nothing to do with that because we are not doing cubes okay it is just a square 0 in other words how many squares are there all around this
okay okay okay so remember surface area area is just the surface not the inside okay that is a good point do you understand yeah okay so can you start counting not counting calculating okay write in your notebook just like the way i wrote on the board
so once you have your box boys and girls you can start figuring out the surface area of this box the entire box it is just like counting all the squares around this box okay so that is the number of squares area
so what do you mean what do you actually mean here gordan tell me about this how did you figure these out
huh so the top area i can know by the bottom because it is the same area okay so you are saying the top area is the same as the bottom area okay
huh okay where is the front so 3 units by 4 units show me huh go ahead so there are 12 square units right
and then the front and the back are the same okay then what about the last 2 right okay so that is why you did it twice okay and how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangle
and then you have the surface surface area okay very good okay are you what are you working on
0
okay so just quickly fix it and then you can start looking for the area that is good okay so ming what is the strategy for finding the surface area
okay just a minute okay why do not you look at this for now all right so tell me how you can find the surface area or what is the surface area the top the area of the top you find it by multiplying the length by the width
okay and why did you why do you have to multiply the length by the width to figure out the area where is the area the units okay the number what are these square units good so once you have this then what do you do
remember we have to look for the surface area that means they are all these sides all together all right yes sir so what do you have to do well can you figure out this area of this side how about the area of this
and so what does that mean
right so once the area around the box yes so how do you find the total surface area well you can do this right you can do this so once you have all 6 then then what do you do i do not know okay so let us see that in your notebook all right
so let us put this aside and why do not you start writing hey boys and girls i need to see that in your notebook okay so you need to write down surface area okay lawrence where is it put this book away where is the surface area
i do not know and you need to show me how you found 108 108 what units surface area is that a unit so you need to show how you found each one okay all right
are you all set okay so you got the 1st step if you have tape yes you can just take this corner all right okay samantha you know what is happening what are you what are what are you looking for now
all round this box right okay . okay so how do you think you can find the area to the bottom so let us say that is the top this is the bottom
go ahead so can you write that down all right alphonsus i need to see your work wait are you sure after we add to all these we add all the colors why are we doing this why are you adding why do you need to add those numbers and what is surface area
the area of the 3 dimensional shape okay kevin if you were to explain to someone what surface area is let us say you have this prism okay then what do you do how do you explain it surface area is the area on what surface it is just one surface
all the sides and surface okay so how do you think you earlier you asked me whether you have to add the numbers right so do you have to add those and why
right okay so once you have found 6 surfaces and then you just add them right and that is exactly what marlene just said is that right very good excuse me okay now if you were looking at this box like this right so where is the top
this is the top bottom front back right side and side can you see there are 6 sides and you can also look at it from this angle so can this be the front and then what would the back be right side and side right
so depending on how you look at the box if you put it up this way then this would be the top okay so you have to decide how you want to look at this box and then figure out okay the front side back top bottom
okay esther let me see your let us see so what do you have to do next we count the bottom area okay and what do you notice about the top and the bottom they are the same
okay and can you see that they are actually the same yeah all right now you have top and bottom excuse me okay michael i want you to start figuring out the the answer and how did you get this number well at 1st i was looking at this then i do not think we can count it did you count all the squares no
kevin did you write down the surface area and you showed how you found it okay can you check with each other and make sure you agree
yes michael 0 i counted all the squares yeah okay you counted each one of these okay well that works because you are looking for the surface of this whole thing right but what i would like you to do is to take this box like one side at a time so you calculate the area of this side this side this side this side this side and then what do you do at the end huh
and then you have the total surface area okay just like the way i wrote on the board is it a red yes sir right there okay let us see okay very good all right okay maybe another minute boys and girls take another minute to finish
and then if you are done i would like you to write down okay listen in please to write down how you can calculate or find a surface area of a rectangular prism okay so if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find a surface area and what would you say okay just write it down okay
okay let me have you stop for a minute boys and girls so i think most of you have found that the area of all the sides okay so how can we find the area the surface area or the area to all of these sides around this rectangular prism what is this you have to combine all the areas okay do you agree with that
you have to combine all the areas okay of the area of the sides
okay so we need to find the area how many squares on each surface right
okay so can you help finish this the rest of this and what about the bottom area okay james
i am sorry okay so let us say we are looking at this box from this angle let us say this is 6 and 4 and 3 okay so the bottom .
okay bottom is this area here right okay so how do we find the bottom area james we multiply okay multiply
did i hear 24 units yes okay why is it important to say square units instead of units are they the same no because a square unit would be 3 dimensional 2
okay square units mean okay are these squares yeah so are these square units yes so it is important because they can be any type of unit so it is important because people might get confused like what kind of unit square angle
right if you just say units then it could be an inch a centimeter okay a foot et cetera right but when you say square units what does that mean you actually count squares number of squares so when we say cubic just like last week we count the number of .
cubes or boxes right cubes okay so it is very important that you use the right unit okay now let us move on to the next one so cole what would the next one be let us say this is the front the front area would be listen in please
okay ..
well okay how come some people disagree okay let us hear it marlene did you disagree no so is it wrong that it is 3 by 66 by 306 by 3 does it matter it is the same okay now group one all right okay hold it hold it
how many people actually have 3 units by 6 units okay how many have 6 units by 3 units okay and do you get the same answer the same number of squares how many have something different for the front side joshua what do you have i have 3 times 43 times 4 how did he get 3 times 4
he went the other way 0 so this is your front side is that right joshua okay okay so simon simon which is front is this front side or is this front side this is probably both what do you mean both explain to us please like it depends on the okay one at a time it depends on the way you look at it
you could you could say you could like say this is the front as well you could like say this is the front this is the front okay and do you agree with him depending on how you look at this right and i drew this up here i say we are going to look at this box from this angle so we say this is the front side but if you look at it from this way that is your front the front side right can the top be the front also yeah okay all right
so let us just keep this as the front side and what about the the cole so what is that
okay all right someone else the back side kevin it is the same is that right yeah okay very good and then the side so this side and that side okay dylan what is the side or left side this side
i am sorry can you see this so what is that side or this side oops this side 03 by 4 okay
so 3 units by 4 units and that is 12 okay and then the last one okay selina okay and that is 12 right
okay and i asked you to write down how you find the total surface area so what would you say lily coyne how can you find the total surface area all of these
okay so now the surface area of this rectangular prism is
okay remember square units all right are you all set yeah okay so let me give you another one to practice and you can use this box or you can draw a box but this is it has different dimensions okay so for this 11st of all i am going to have you find the volume and then you will find the surface area okay
so this is the rectangular prism okay wait a minute simon let us leave that up okay because i want people to be able to see that ..
okay so draw in your notebook i have to draw what i want you to draw the prism and then i want you to find the volume okay we have been practicing finding volumes right and then the surface area
what are the dimensions of this box michael do you see the numbers
okay william what is this 1224 i counted the number of cubes did you count the number of cubes yeah so earlier we said that we can find one layer and then multiply it by the number of layers right
so what is that bottom layer how many cubes can that hold 44 okay now remember we are going back to volume so the number of cubes you can put inside 0 without this 12 so now there are 2 layers so 24
right so volume is 24 cubic inches that is good and now you are going to think about the surface area okay excuse me so volume how did you find the volume what is that
okay write it next to it please
okay so you have the box and now look for the volume and then look for the surface area so remember to label the numbers rachel labeling 0 you labeled with number but what about the units
huh i am sorry volume squared okay now remember volume going back to last week what does volume mean the number of cubes we can put inside right so what units do we call those
what is that top
and then the surface area since we are looking for area it is just the number of squares right .
did you finish lawrence male yes now what are you supposed to do to these numbers are we supposed to just leave the numbers without labels and then what i would like you to do is to find see if you can find an easier way to find the surface area instead of finding the top and then the bottom and the front and the back is there an easier way
i think there is really yes i think so 2 times okay if you want to look at this 2 times 4 is 2 times 2 times that and then times 28
no no no 2 times one and then like easy like these 2 numbers you times them so which is 8 and you do 8 for the next one as well okay you do times 2 times 3 which is 64 times 3 12 times 12 okay why did you do those twice each one twice because like for each side like right here i am going to try no no that is not that is not right you still find the same answer because each side is the same
okay like on the other side huh this side and the back side it says right the top and the bottom okay very good so you notice the front and the back and the top and the bottom those are the same and instead of finding it 2 times you know you just find once and then multiply by 2 very good so maybe you can try to write a formula okay those people who finished see if you can write a formula for finding a surface area
see if there is an easier way to do that instead of doing 6 steps and then add is there an easier way
do you see a pattern any patterns i can make it into 3 steps okay and how is that how does that work because this is the same on the other side so you can do 4 times 2 times 2 so but that is only 3 steps okay i have got the answer good so so you do not have to repeat that right because it okay
very good can you write a formula just write it down 00 so the formula is i would be just adding just multiplying it out okay what do you notice about these numbers they are the same right yeah
and so are these you see so how can you write a formula i can not yet write a formula if you can write a formula to find surface area something that is easier you know than doing one side at a time think about it later okay not now
yes you could do top times top plus front plus right times 2 i did it so top area plus front area plus right area times 2 why times 2
0 very good can you write it just write the whole formula surface area equals i got one step we do length times height times width remember what that we did that last week right
so what is that 0 i know how what would that be if you multiply it
right that would be the volume but we are not looking for volume right i mean you found the volume now we are looking for surface area i figured out an easier way okay because if you know the top area is 6 times 4 you do not have to do the bottom because it is going to be the same so you go the sides and both sides and front and back and then left and right
okay so if you only find one of them and then double multiply by 2 then you find okay very good it has got to be the same yes it is like one is over here and then the other side right very good very good boys and girls it is almost time for us to go so but we will come back after gym i am sorry okay so when we come back excuse me listen
okay so i would like you to think about a way or a formula or a shorter way an easier way to find surface area okay and then when we come back we will have a few more minutes before lunch and then we can talk about that okay
so and for homework okay i do have more of these rectangular prisms simon for you to go home and find and practice finding surface area okay so why do not you just leave everything here and then line up quietly i am going to turn off the camera
so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0 so i think anthony you were the one that said that right so anthony is right negative numbers have value that is less than 0
does anyone know what do we call numbers like 1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 so 0 is kind of in between right it is neither positive nor negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20 right
so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say 0 my account is negative so that means that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30
now you are negative $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game so some of you mentioned golf but also like video games sometimes right i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative
it will say minus the point or minus however many points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah there are negative numbers on a thermometer we talked yesterday about the thermometer right so we looked at it 2 different ways right
this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right this side has fahrenheit and celsius and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right what were some of the landmark numbers we talked about do you remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what do you remember what the celsius is when it is 32 degrees fahrenheit it is what temperature in the celsius 00
and what is that temperature freezing temperature of water that is right 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and we talked about what was that average human body temperature 212 i think it was but you are right what was 212 boiling water boiling of water right and then we talked about bath water is about 110
okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home do any of you notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right but some people still have these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water
all right in the thermostat that is what we call it it shows the temperature there right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right
and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer during what season winter right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers so going back to the chart it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer we just talked about that in golf there are scores with negative numbers
so how many of you watch golf do any of you or play golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3 or 4 let us do 4 that is easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole
what is your score what did you say -one because there it was expected you would need 4 strokes hitting the ball 4 times to get the ball in the hole you only took 3 so it is -one and the more the higher your negative number the better you are doing because that is how many strokes under par so if you did exactly 4 strokes if it took you 4 times hitting the ball to get it into the hole you would be on par which means your score would be 0
if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay
negative temperatures are cold temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right where do we expect warmer temperatures all year long all year long we talked about location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long arizona because it is closer yep
california and miami we noticed they had warmer temperatures where did we notice the coldest temperatures no matter and the poles right the north pole and the south pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time that is why your desk needs to be cleared off
so i am going to start out by showing you the game board so this game is called number line tug of war so
all right i want you to look at this think about what you think the object of the game might be not yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game look at the spinner at your table talk to a partner tell me what you think about this game what do you think but how how are you going to win look at what you have you have a spinner you have these spaces here
you have a star over here and a star over here so talk to your partner
orion why do not you go to table 3 and table 4 go to table 4 isaiah come over here segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
michael can you go see if they are at the end of the hallway because i accidentally just pressed something and i do not know if i turned it off yes 0 let us wait 12nd so i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again is that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something
so i just want to make sure it is still working so well i do not want to press it again in case it is nothing uhh so look at the game board again i am going to remind you what you are thinking about think about what do you see on the spinner why do you think the spinner is designed the way that it is think about this says team one this says team 2 you see stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
the other side one is on the left side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no you do
where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working let us just keep going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner does everyone see that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what
less than 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 so we have -and positive numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do do nothing you are not going to do anything
you just have to what you do have to use paperclips you are right you are actually going to use 3 paperclips you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay what about the stars why do you think there is one star over here and another star .
whichever team gets to the end of the board 1st but which way are they both going the same way no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place but what is going to happen over here you are trying to get to what positive number 10 right over here what are you trying to get to -negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right
usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right you are trying to get to the end so here we have 2 different ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right the other team is going to really want to get negative numbers okay one of the things that we need to do on here what do we call this in between what is right here a line a number line right
so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light what do you think i should probably do before starting the game well yes but i am talking about with the number line yeah label it right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that so what are we going to put here
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10 you got to pay attention isaiah now we are going to label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right the numbers that are greater than 0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers let us label the other side now we are starting with 0
now we are moving to the left what is going to be right here -one -one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0 and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10 so what kind of numbers are they hoping to spin on the spinner
-negative numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner then team one puts the paperclip right on 0 do you see
it fits really well right it lines up so it is the perfect size the small paperclips so we start team one at 0 and we start team 2 at 0 you always have to keep in mind your goal team one is trying to get +10 team 2 is trying to get to -10 and obviously whoever reaches their goal 1st is going to win
this might remind you a little bit kind of like football right where 2 different teams are getting to opposite end zones right
they have to go negativeso then they are behind right so they got -2 now they have 12 steps to try and get over that was a good question so yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2 so now they are at -3 then they got another negative
they are at -4 now they still have to move back up you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right if they are trying to get that way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right and then you have to move this way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right
what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so if you were there yeah you would just stay there till you got a positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10 bradley and isaiah you need to be focused and paying attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop all right so i think we will just divide the class in half
so the back of the class is going to be team 2 the front of the class is going to be team one
so bobby your hand went up 1st you can roll for spin for team 11st come on up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right so he is at 0 if you got +3 where should he move to 3 so you can move right on the line very good so i need someone from team 2
segala come on over you are raising your hand nicely so now what should your team be thinking -negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
come here segala you forgot to move your game piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left left left one space very good now we need another okay rocco your hand came up next yep 0 +3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to 6 very good okay
alexander your hand came up 1st so you are thinking -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place all right michael come on up
all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are bradley come on up remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game 0 +3 so which way do we have to move so you would go 0 that is 112 okay good job
remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right because we are learning the game noisha come on over be a positive okay +one there you go
okay jasmine come on up 0 -2 very good
so wait a minute we are at +2 where should she end up at if she got 0 that is right very good remember from 2 to one is one he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012 okay makes sense all right who has not come up yet kobe come on up
0 okay uhh alicia come on up there is lots of people whose hands are raised you have to be patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you yes 0
nathan come on up what score does team one need to win 33 +3 let us see
yeah get a -3 please +3 so team one won this time this is what we are going to do stop talking we are going to play the game again we are going to switch so the back group is going to be team one the front group is going to be team 2 so what is your goal now positive 10 wait a minute stop for a minute
if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line we are +10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal -10 right where do we need to start both team pieces at 0 okay so team one
isaiah your hand was up 1st so be careful walking around the camera oops so you got -30 wait you are going to move your piece on the line very good uhh bobby wait a minute
let me see who has not come up in the front row
angel you have not come up yet come on up that was nice of you bobby to point out who did not go so remember you are thinking negative right +3 hold on no wait a minute that is team one you are team 2 now so okay uhh who has not come up yet orion come on up hi
remember we are going to try and stay quiet and focus on the game so +one so what do you have to do yeah so wait a minute you are on -3 they are moving one so you are at -2 okay who has not come up on this side samantha why do not you come up
so give it a spin okay +2 she did spin it so you are going to move where no +2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment so right now let us stop for a minute team 2 is at +5 right
where are they trying to get to negative not -10 so someone on this front team can you tell me how many spaces away are you from -10 right now
yes what then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers all right alicia did you come up yet yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down
are you saying if you are at 9 and you get 33 then you just move up one and you have won you do not have to get exactly +one okay that was a good question miguel come on up let us see we are both kind of in the wrong place right now right team one is in the negative they want to be in the positive team 2 is in the positive they want to be in the negative table 4 orion you need to be paying attention the whole time
that is +2 +2 yeah hold on wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 very good okay who has not come up yet on this noisha do you come up yet cassidy come on up
cassidy got 0 so we stay right where we are who has not come up in the back nathaniel come on up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is okay juzan come on up
uhh i hope everyone is listening 0 staying right where she is okay does everyone in the back come up anaya come on up let us see let us try to quiet down and focus
remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up arnina and davina i know 0 and aaron ready so you are going to try and get a -3 very good you are at 5 so where are you going to go to very good so you are at 2 now
getting better davina come on up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening -2 so you are at 0 so now where do you have to go hey
all right bobby come on up .
+0 okay very good alexander come on up excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now so +2 come over here you have to move
hey kobe come on up he went up once now we are on everyone is 2nd turn so remember what number you are trying to get -one all right wait a minute kobe you are going to move the game piece very good okay 0 tire will be next all right alicia come on up
and aaron aaron you will be up next too remember alicia is team one so they are trying to get to +10 right -3 all right wait you got to move it alicia we got negative
okay we will play the game for a couple more minutes and then at that point if we have not gotten anywhere we will look to see who is closest to their goal and that team will be the winner all right +one not -one +one there you go hey aaron come on up table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3
wait a minute yes so you are at -3 where do you need to go to very good okay michael come on up can not move that yep +3 hold on you are going to move it uhh jasmine come on up
i like the way jasmine is sitting quietly i like the way some people are sitting up nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts +2 go ahead very good okay nathan come on up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards
hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward he had +one yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward he did it at 1st and then he went back and fixed it bradley come on up
well but that is not your goal your goal is to get to -10 +3 good brad move it bradley you got to move it you are at 2 so where are you going to move to to the 5 very good hey rocco come on up come on rocco so +one come here
michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom
segala come on up 0 that is okay okay noisha come on up
come over here you are going to move the game board that was 2 you had 712 okay it is almost 10 0 and at that time i wanted to start you playing partners so we have enough time for 2 more people to come up and spin so we need one for team one so anthony come on up yes and then tire you can be the 2nd one so +2
so you are at 5 where do you go very good angel i mean tire sorry sorry angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin -2
okay where were you just now 7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here i need voices off and i need your eyes on the board we said we were stopping the game here now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10 why is team one the winner alexandra
cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so team one is closer to their goal how far away is team one from their goal 3 how far is team 2 from their goal 18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner so does everyone understand how to play the game yes i think i think this game is rigged
do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute that is something you can investigate when you are working with your partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns one of you will be team one the 1st time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch so remember the things you are going to need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips you are going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place
obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right since you are playing against each other what is the vocabulary term for that you are what competitive you are competing but you are what what do we call people who are playing against each other opponents that is right or foe yes another way you could say it is rival who just said that why would you do that
why so yes
yeah so you 2 can play together you 2 can play together anthony can you do me a favor can you pass out 3 paperclips to each pair quickly you 2 will play and you and .
are they up here yes no they are playing and they are playing
who will kobe will play with bobby you are going to be team one and kobe will be team 2 and then you will switch you are not worrying about the other people at the table so alexander you will play with segala
umm bradley anaya you are going to play with isaiah over at the back table come back here
your legs need to be under your desk please okay so let us check i want to see does everyone have the materials they need i am asking you to pay attention right now everyone has 3 paperclips yes
anthony go give them and everyone has a game board you know who you are playing with right where do you need to start your game pieces 00 where is team one is goal what is their goal +10 what is team 2 is goal i am asking you a question what is team 2 is goal -10 all right you can start to play
i am going to be around to watch what you are doing 0 bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line some of you already did it label it very good do not forget to label your number line 0 you guys already did it great good jood
i see people using the negative numbers label your number line please do you remember to label your number line go ahead and label your number line
i did not do that correctly angel there is no reason to get that loud what is the problem bradley no we need another paper clip you have another one you need another one
they are on my desk make the minus ah very good what side is what
that one is really in half so i would spin again where is this supposed to be you are going to make sure and where is that one supposed to be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
go ahead
one of the things you might have to do when you are doing this is you might have to stand a little bit because if you keep jerking this around your paperclips are going to go everywhere right 0 no no no no you know anything you should do
go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet aaron aaron very good whoa whoa whoa where were you
-3 nice you seem like 5 minutes
okay we are going to do that again
let me hold it for now you finished who won 3
so now you are going to switch segala will be team one and you will be team 2 so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10 yes when when i was with the spin orion accidentally put it up and it flanked okay so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior and i think i have said that more than once during this lesson you need to focus on what you are doing
yes then we switch right team if you were team one now you will be team 2 if you were team 2 now you will be team one how is it going
on the bottom okay fine yeah
this is our 2nd game your 2nd how many games have you played 3 who is won so far both times 0 you each won once when you are being +10 or -10 you were negative anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
but that shows that you can win when you are negative where are you you are moving in the wrong direction right now so how many places away are you from your goal 20 20 if you are a +10
what is this for i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now
no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at -0 my
okay 123 let us see who is listening i hear people talking and you should not be i handed you a piece of notebook paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games some of you have played more games than that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game
i heard somebody saying that you thought the game was unfair i want you to tell me why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line what operation or operations okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair okay so right now pick up your paper you can leave the game put the paperclips on the game board and leave it at that desk i will collect them in a minute
head back to your seats
okay my math goals reader can you please read the math goals for today students will be able to compare decimals using graphic representation excellent
students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than . and and equal to one another very nice okay so what do we know about decimals so far think about when we 1st started decimals on friday what did you learn about decimals
you can go back into your notes if you need to what did you learn about decimals or what do you know about decimals tan decimal is the fraction that is small decimal is a fraction please class what else do you know about decimals ban
fraction is the number of the smaller so the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction if you have more zeros the smaller the fraction so the smaller the decimal good anything else tiffany what did you learn about decimals it is like money it is like money what do you mean
i can not hear you what do you mean it is like money can you explain your thinking we gave an example on friday about money can you talk about that what do you mean it is like money
what about it is like money exxon that the decimal you use it for money like the decimal you use it for money and other stuff so you are trying to help tiffany out okay tiffany i am coming back to you how is it like money
thank you we talked about it on friday do you remember the example we gave on friday i can not hear you you are right i can not hear you though can you say it louder we talked about a quarter and how is that like a decimal it is part of a . it is part of a good it is part of a dollar
so it is a fraction of a dollar good and one more person tao a decimal is like it represents a fraction and a short way of words so it is like a fraction and it is a short way of words what do you mean like it represents a fraction
so you think it is a shorter way of writing a fraction maybe not shorter but different right okay so who remembers this from friday we talked about this so decimal is a number with a decimal point in it i think that is what you mean for money tiffany all the digits to the left of the decimal represents whole numbers
so 6 is a whole number 0 and 0 these are all whole numbers because they are to the left of the decimal all the numbers to the right of the decimal represent the actual decimal the actual fractional piece so where is the decimal here in this number ritchie 52 and how would i say that number 5200th good do not forget the 6
let us try to say the whole thing 6 and decimal 6 and 6 and 52 what you said before 5252 what decimal 52 what okay let us try to put the whole thing together 6.526 and
and 52 okay by yourself 65200 we are missing something 65200th one more time 6 and 5200th good and what is the decimal part here hannah
how will i say this 5 tenths 5 tenths when it is a 0 you will need to say 0 okay you just say 5 tenths tricky how do we say this one punk
hannah does he need to say 0 no 100th 100th very nice excellent so today we are going to be comparing decimals but 1st i want you to write down this number and what each place value is so the 2 is in the 1000s place the one is in the 100s place
the 6 in the 10s the 4 in the ones and then we have our decimal so the 5 is in the tenths place and the 7 is in the hundredths place now remember when you are saying your decimal numbers to cover your mouth because you may end up spitting on the person in front of you okay i want to make sure i hear that part i will give you about 2 minutes to copy that down so we can move on
now you do not have to copy it the way that you see it
one more minute no sneezing bless you you got it ritchie let me see okay let us stay here let us stay here
10 seconds okay you alright you seem a little scared you okay did the camera scare you do not let it scare you do not worry it is not going anywhere okay
it is just regular math class okay okay are we ready stand up if you are ready to move on to the next thing okay alrighty if you did not finish you can copy from the person sitting next to you so in your groups i have several numbers here you see where each number is underlined
i want you to tell me what place is it in okay so in your groups identify which place is it in is it in the ones place is it in the 10s place is it in the tenths place is it in the hundredths place so in your groups get started 5 minutes work as a group
as a group so far all i hear is tao trying to work with her group but i do not hear any other groups trying to work with each other not independently do not copy it
she is not copying it did we talk about this or did you just put this down on your notebook did you talk about it with hannah tee and magnolia so erase it
i want to have a discussion about it can we talk about it come on come on come
i do not know do you agree that this is the 10s place do you agree
where is the decimal right after here right what is the place that comes after the decimal 1010s and after that 100 so what place is this in 100 so this is why you guys need to have a discussion about it this is to help each other out okay
wendy what about the next 1000s wendy thinks this is the 1000s place let us have a discussion about this the decimal is here
and where is it okay the decimal is right here yeah and the number is here so what place is this before decimal what place is this ones so this would be the it is right before the decimal right so what would this be one
what would this be ones did you tell me which one reaches in can we write together yeah we do
i do not see it there i do not know how to do it where is the decimal am i pointing to it what place comes before the decimal one
so what would this be 10 what would this be 10 it seems like you are having trouble working with a group and that can not happen here all of you that is not fair that you are in a group yet you want to be selfish and not share your knowledge with anybody else why do you think i put you in a group to work together to work together and to help each other
are any of you actually doing that are any of you actually doing that yes or no so that means you are not following my directions okay so we need to work how not by ourselves right now so let us work together
okay 2 more minutes to finish this up and then we are going to go over each one what do you think exxon do you agree with all your choices the 4 or the 6 the 6 this is the hundredths
why are the arrows pointing towards the wrong number
hannah says this is in the 10s place do we agree because we all have different answers if we are working together we do not have the same answer what do you think tiffany do you agree with her your paper says no what do you think it is what do you think tee so how is it possible that if i ask you to work together you all have different answers
how is that possible tell hannah why you think it is the ones place tell her why not hannah where is your decimal where is your decimal
what is the place before the decimal also 100s and hundredths are spelled very differently so this if you are saying hundredths it would be wrong because you are spelling 100s you see how it has the ths this has the ths also so erase the ds all right let us go over this let us do the 1st one
who can come up here and label what place the 6 is in
come on exxon
okay if you agree with exxon give me a thumbs up if you disagree thumbs down you think they agree with you thumbs up all right next one pass it to somebody else thumbs up if we agree with tan
thumbs down if we disagree okay tan pass it to anybody else they do not have to have their hands raised it is more fun when they do not come on missus embry
are you trying to say the same place as exxon or a different place is it the same place or a different place same place so you see how he spelled his
all right thumbs up if we agree with glendy thumbs down if we disagree okay it looks like everybody agrees with you all right next place do not forget this side of the room the ones place thumbs up if you agree with tao thumbs down if you disagree
hang on let us see who agrees and who disagrees okay good come on tiffany look at that they are clapping for you and everything alrighty thumbs up if we agree with tiffany that it is in the 100s place thumbs down if you disagree okay let us practice saying these numbers
who thinks they can say this one hannah can you say it a little bit louder 4 and 600s 4 and 600s sounds good to me what about this one magnolia 60
64 and 1818 tenths magnolia says 64 and 18 tenths so think about what the last thing you just said was 18 tenths is that possible which one do you think it is 1818 what hundredths
all right let us try that again 64 and 18 hundredths beautiful 64 and 18 hundredths and the next one glendy 4 and 6 hundredths what number is this 6 what number is this 16
16 what 100s let us try that again 4 and 16 hundredths 4 and 16 hundredths the next one tee 5 and 83 hundredths 5 and 83 hundredths and last but not least exxon 5 and 13 hundredths 5 and 13 hundredths i love it i love it alrighty
so today we are going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another you are going to be using charts i am going to give 2 to each group these charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another what does it mean to compare what do you think i mean when i mean to compare decimals
think about your goals for today your objective for today what do i want you to do with decimals i will wait because the witnesses seem a little distracted so i will ask my question again what do you think i mean when i say compare when you compare numbers what do you do magnolia compare not quite exxon 10th she just said the same thing and i said not quite comparing numbers
i am not talking about division comparing numbers magnolia can you read the goal again for a language objective so i told everyone to start with decimals r s m greater than and equal to so i will ask you again what do you think i mean when i say compare decimals what are you going to be doing
only tao knows only exxon fang what do you think i am going to be asking you to do magnolia can you read the objective again for fang i do not think he was listening
students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than and equal to one another so what do you think you are going to be doing i can not hear you compare the decimals what does it mean to compare go back to my initial question tee
to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller or equal to another decimal right so here i have 2 examples of decimals you are going to be seeing whether they are smaller bigger or equal to each other and i want you to use those charts to help you figure it out as a group alright does everyone have those charts okay
so we are going to play a group war and how this works is i am going to give you some time to think about it to think about the numbers by yourself and then you are going to share with your group what you are thinking and then each group is going to have one leader this leader is going to share their thinking with the class
but here is the trick each group needs to be prepared to share because you never know which group is going to get called on alright and 2 groups will be getting called on which means you have to tell me whether you agree or disagree with each other okay so let me show you the practice
this is a practice round so i already pre selected these decimals so the decimals that you are comparing is 110th and 12 hundredths you want to tell me if 110th is less than greater than or equal to 12 hundredths you are going to think about it by yourself for 30 seconds 1st and then when i tell you to share your thoughts with your group that is when you are going to share with your group okay
and then i am going to have group one and group 2 so i am going to call the number out let us see we do not have a 193 jabdiel is group is usually here right he is 3 so group one would be inspectors
group 2 would be we do not have a 17 do we have a 15 tiffany is group alright so then inspectors will be talking 1st about what they think
and then tiffany is group will be talking about if they agree or disagree with what fang said now here is the order in which you will go group one goes 1st and then group 2 will follow you never know if group 2 is going to go 1st or group one okay so you have to be on your toes
so at this point i want you to pick your leader for your group okay inspectors who is your leader me who is me witnesses who is your leader exxon
and detectives who is your leader beautiful okay we are ready so remember i am going to give you 30 seconds to think about it by yourself and then you are going to share your thinking with your leader so your leader is going to take all the knowledge that you have given him plus or her plus their own and have a discussion about it are we ready
okay so here is the 1st 2 cards so i want you to think about it 1st put it in your notebooks what you are thinking
remember you can use that chart that i gave you to help you compare them maybe you want to color in 67 hundredths and color in 5 tenths to see which one is greater okay now i want you to discuss it as a group i will give you about one to 2 minutes to discuss it
you need to tell me why is it bigger why is it smaller why is it equal to the other number you do not need to copy what i have on the board all you need to do is explain
use this to help you
use one at time so do not use that one yet did you guys use a chart to help figure it out
30 seconds
okay what do you think and then color and model
tenths not 10s tenths do not spit at her
okay let us see which group is group one
let us see who is group 2 okay let us see who is up 1st group 2 explain your thinking come on
can you speak louder because that group needs to agree disagree or .
which one is smaller or bigger i think 6700 again louder because you are talking to that group you are not talking to your notebook
i think the number 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths because 6700 is called a 100th and 5 tenths is called a 10th so the 100th is bigger than 10th okay what do you think we agree can you speak louder
we agree because i can not hear you we agree because we also think 6700 is bigger 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths natan said something interesting he said hundredths is bigger than tenths is that true is that true do you remember exxon is cake on friday that we cut it remember i gave the example of exxon is cake
we cut it into hundredths pieces were the pieces bigger no no so the bigger the denominator you said that earlier the more zeros you add to it the smaller the number so think about what you said i know what you meant but hundredths is not bigger than tenths it depends on the situation okay you know what i mean okay and what do you guys think do you agree with these 2 groups that 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths tiffany you did a graphic representation
can i see it so on the charts they actually colored in the 5 tenths and the 6700 which coloring is bigger exxon hundredths can you say the number 6700 so the 6700 is closer to a whole correct so therefore it is bigger very nice
are you ready for our next round okay so this is 30 seconds of wait time
okay now share your thinking with your group
i do not know what the question is i put it right there it is like what question was it can you repeat what he said gwendy gwendy was not listening to you ethan did not that mean
say it again and then repeat after him say it again and then repeat after him
i think the 1st time was too much for me okay share them with our groups now what we think
i did not hear it no i did not did you color in 5 tenths correctly is that a new one or is that the old 14 tenths and 4th 800s okay i thought you colored in the old one
no
okay let us see whose group won
let us do a different one we do not have that okay are we ready let us see which group is up 1st group one you are up 1st i think . louder exxon wants to hear you he is ready to fight i know exxon
he loves to argue i think the 1400 is bigger than 4 tenths because 4 tenths is just 54 and 0 the 1300 is 40 and 40 is bigger than 4
if you add more 0 the number becomes 4 i respectfully disagree why do you respectfully disagree because if you they are the same because if you just put the 0 they will be the same and if you and if you like here it will be the same too it is the same it shows the same tan he is talking to fang do you mind being quiet can you repeat that again because she kept talking
because when you are going to do they are the same because they show the same representation if you are going to color it you have to color both of those 4 sides so they are the same okay tiffany what do you think you agree or disagree who do you agree with i agree with group 2 you agree with group 2 now tiffany also colored in i like that tiffany keeps using graphic representations because it helps prove your point a little bit better
she colored in 4 tenths right she also colored in 40 hundredths where do they stop do they stop in the same place yes so 4 tenths is still 6 tenths away from a whole and 40 hundredths is 60 hundredths away from a whole so they are actually equal good job group 2
alrighty and one more round are we ready i told you exxon is going to aruge it is a hard one it is a hard one because we have not talked about thousandths yet
try to figure this out
so 30 seconds of wait time and then you are going to share
okay now discuss with your groups what you are thinking
is this a little tricky part 2 because if you add another 0 to the 222 hundredths and there is like a 5 over there and 5 is bigger than the 0 so i think it is like part 2 is bigger than part 2 wow what do you think
i think it is closer to part 2 why because ritchie what do you think she got my idea
it is a very good idea alrighty it is my favorite part are we ready let us see who group one is
okay let us see which group is up 1st group 2 detectives you are up 1st what do you think can you speak louder tiffany we think it is part 2 because we think part 2 is what
okay
then what
how how do you know that let us see what the other group thinks we agree that the answer is part 2 the answer is part 2 what answer
00 i mean 220 225 is is bigger than 2200 why think about what tao said
because if you add a 0 to 200 still the 5 will be bigger than 0 so what number would this be 200 200 200000s and this would be 225000 which one of those is bigger 225000
225000 is bigger than 220000 right so you are correct part 2 is bigger and i like the way that you guys thought about it also so you are just bringing me on to what i was going to explain to you so let us go back to these 2 decimals that we talked about earlier sometimes you do not even need a graphic representation to help you figure out how to compare decimals
the 1st thing you do is you line up your decimals so that they are one on top of the other are my decimals on top of each other it makes it easier to compare then we look at our ones place what are the numbers in our ones place glendy and can i compare that no that does not help me then i move to my tenths place tan what are the numbers in my tenths place
and 2 and what is the number in my tenths place and does that help me no what about in the 100s place magnolia 11 and 5 does that help me compare
yes or no okay which one of these is bigger 7 or 5 ritchie 7 the 7 is bigger therefore this number is bigger than 5 so 27 hundredths is bigger than 25 hundredths okay so now what i want you to do is i want you to look at the back of the room
i have 2 decimals on the board 37 hundredths and 4 tenths i want you to tell me if it is less than greater than or equal to in your notebooks by yourself
i am coming i am coming is it less than greater than or equal to
there are also still charts on your desk if you need the support this is bigger than this
use this use those charts to help you where is yours
okay which one is bigger good
it is a weird looking symbol okay who wants to share their thinking who wants to share their thinking so far i have walked around and i think i like what i see tao i think 0.37
how do we say that number 37 hundredths hundredths good it is greater than 4 tenths and 4 hundredths and 4 hundredths it is greater than 0.37 you said 0.37 is greater than 4 tenths is that what you mean to say
so you think this number is bigger than this number exxon i respectfully disagree because if you put the 7 to the 4 that will be bigger you can not just add 7s what is a number that you can add that does not change 0 okay and which one of those is bigger 47 hundredths
what is this number 40 hundredths okay if you think that this number is smaller stand up tao you change your mind i said that 4 hundredths is bigger than 0.37 you know what you said at 1st that 0.37 is bigger than 4 tenths
that is what you said you did not mean that but you said that that is okay we make mistakes all the time you know i make mistakes every single day 27000 times a day so you are correct 37 hundredths is smaller than 4 tenths you know what i saw when i came around this is what glendy did she did exactly what i just showed her she looked at the zeros she said the zeros do not help me and then she looked at the 3 and the 4
and i asked her which one is bigger and she said 4 tenths is bigger because 4 is bigger than 3 and she is correct good job excellent work everybody okay let us close our notebooks and let us get ready for our trip
alright 23230 is great okay boys and girls today we are going to talk about fractions and before we talk about anything i want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions okay let us see what we know about fractions what do you know about fractions it is when like a square or when it is divided up into 4
that would probably be a fraction okay when a square is broken up into 4 and a few are shaded in that is a fraction okay what else do we know about fractions let us see what else do we know about fractions the top number is the denominator and bottom is the numerator okay let us think about that for a minute what do you know about fractions
the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the the denominator okay what else do we know about fractions does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole hold on one sec there is fraction that you can do with a half or a whole no i said that fractions have to do with . 0 they have to do with a half or whole okay what else do we think we know about fractions
okay we are going to talk about what the top number is called and what the bottom number is called go ahead isaac what do you know about fractions the .
if there is a shape you can split them in half who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape caleb
if it is a circle it is one whole okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute let us see if what we are saying is valid or what what we are saying is true any other thoughts about fractions last thoguht diana what do you have there is a certain way to write the to write it down there is a certain way to write it down okay alright lots of information
lots of good thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction is a fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay we could call the whole we could call it a whole
we could call it a region what else could we call it
that it that is all you got okay it is part of that whole or region a fraction is also a part of a group of things or we could call it a set of things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group i want a part of that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it
okay because that is very important when you are talking about fractions you are going to take an equal part of a whole re or region or an equal part of a set okay so i want equal parts here my whole how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions
you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want i want to cut something in half one line in the middle right in the middle okay i want an equal amount on one side and an equal amount on the other side so i just did what to that hole i cut it in half half so i am going to label that half a half okay
and how i label it is i take the number of pieces i cut this into how many pieces 222 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the denominator denominator
okay or the bottom number some of you told me right that is the denominator the number of pieces i shaded in is called the .
numeral nu mer a tor everybody say it
numerator numerator okay so that whole i cut into 2 equal pieces the number of pieces i cut it into was the denominator ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see is the numerator okay so if this is one half one half and one half right
one half here one half here how many halves make a whole 22 okay this is my group this is my set how many are there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 66 and i say these are jellybeans and i am hungry this afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans
kay that is my fraction what is the numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry alright so my nu or my fraction is 3 out of 6 i colored in 3 out of 6 i am going to eat 3 out of 6 i am going to get fat okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in
okay and the bottom number is the one that you shaded in is the number of pieces or the number in the set or the group okay you guys think you understand that
yes are you good okay so now we know numerator is the top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about and the denominator is the .
 bottom number the number of pieces in your whole or the number out of the whole set out of the group okay so here we have how many out of how many
66 alright so that is just some of your vocabulary numerator and denominator if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards if you are going to match your vocabulary word with what it means with its meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish it is kind of like go fish
i would like you to play concentration with them 1st that means all of them go upside down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match
0 okay alright so that is your 1st centers right here your vocabulary words are are you listening yep numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think listen to the word equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin
equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction just like this set right here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
3 that is half half of those circles yes yes okay here is one half the circle and here is the other half this is shaded in this is not so 3 sixths is the same as one half one half they are the same thing okay they are equivalent fractions i could do this with my region okay
here is my whole region whoops sorry here it is okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i
okay so i am going to get it into 6 pieces and i am going to do the same thing i am going to color in half so now it is not halves i am talking about it is what sixths and how many did i color in
3 okay so one half is the same as .
3 sixths okay those are equivalent fractions caitlin or it could be like 48s 48s is an equivalent faction it is half of the set 4 is half of 83 is half of 61 is half of 2 wait it is ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then we have got one half 3 sixths
somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is half of 10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another 11020s 10 twentieths yes absolutely great job isaac can i use the bathroom quickly
that is okay go ahead go ahead 9 eighteenths 9 eighteenths thank you isaac dante 51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job okay you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions that is the question i was going to ask what that if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent .
w no it is an equivalent fraction to one half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are yes okay they they they cover the same area or they name the same part of a set
okay equivalent fractions the next word is fraction what is a fraction what is it a a region or a whole that is not a fraction this is not a fraction this is that region of that whole piece that is not a fraction is it no it is a equal lateral
whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of a whole okay half and half quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter how many quarters is that 444
a quarter or a 4th a 4th a 4th and a 4th what if it equals a whole equals a whole it is a whole right okay so it is a part of a whole or a part of a set but it has to be equal part you have to remember that okay equal part a mixed number is .
a fract a whole number and a fraction okay a whole number and fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number and a fraction that is called a mixed number who can give me another mixed number a whole number and a fraction
give me a whole number and a fraction
4 fourths 4 and i need a fraction now take one from the board and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number it is a whole number plus a fraction give me a mixed number 5 and one half good 5 and one half
it is a whole number and a fraction dante 5 and 6 6 thirds i mean 3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good giving me a mixed number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good caitlin
8 and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
what is a mixed number
a whole number and a fraction okay got it okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way to say a mixed number okay an improper fractions has a larger numerator .
over a smaller denominator 0
if you look this is 2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what what how many halves is it 2 and how many halves is it let us count them 2
let us count them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah yes so this is the mixed number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half 0
and there are 12345 halves these are the same 2.5 and 5 halves got it huh sure yes a little bit yes okay i think the only other vocabulary words you need to know benchmark fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the definition okay
because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year and then the last vocabulary word is .
 is called simplest form simiplest form that is another one i am going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions is there a problem right here okay
i did not write on my hand
thank you alright vocabulary cards look vocabulary cards okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice addition and subtraction
there is extra paper right in the back okay this center right here can i just borrow that just the top part honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st i have gone over this already turn the question around into your answers okay
so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer okay jaylon you hold this one it goes right here right here yep pass out paper to these 6 people right here in this center
do not forget to ttqa alright okay and my group right here you are coming back with me 1st okay so carefully to the back table with a pencil yes makenzie you may use the bathroom now honey carefully to the back table with a pencil what can i go to the bathroom yep go quick
and come back quick what is it ashley never mind you all set okay alright do not forget you are working shh in centers
so you should be whispering dylan can you put that back on the sill for me honey let us take one of these chairs out so you are not squished
alright yes please use your problem solving skills
yes dear i hit my arm now it is feeling like now it feels like it went to sleep 0 it is just tingles you hit your funny bone it feels weird can you put your name please who are we missing right yeah she is at the bathroom and ayana who .
ayana christian
so put your name and date and i will be right with you okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other
quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper okay somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that what is a fraction
what is a fraction it is a equal .
 parts parts equal part of a whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay so if i had a candy bar if i did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart okay
let us say that our hershey is bar had 6 sections in it okay can you imagine that in your head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here close your eyes and think about it can you see that chocolate bar yes i can see it clearly
no honey you got to listen so now we have 6 pieces in our chocolate bar right and if this chocolate bar had to be shared equally .
how many pieces would each of them get 3 and how do you know that cause this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but okay
i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar 66 so the whole candy bar has how many pieces 6 so what do we call that number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in 6 now .
if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces 33 so what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3
yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word numerator say it numerator one more time numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the we just said it numerator out of
6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
denominator you guys are getting these words really mixed up listen numerator and denominator listen the 3 is the numerator can you say it please
christian you say it please 3 is the numerator yep do not star say it again the numerator michael you say it 6 is the denominator good 3 is the numerator
numerator cause if you get them mixed up here and you and read a paper that says what number is the numerator you really need to know which one is which okay so the 3 is the numerator
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it 6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you denominator good denominator denominator perfect so how many pieces are there in the candy bar
3 how many is cheyenne going to eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another 3 sixths equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar excellent what is it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes alright
so we have rectangular paper right this is going to be our region or our whole okay
yes you should okay we are going to take our 1st rectangle what what are the dimensions of a rectangle what does it tell us the dimensions of a rectangle are what are the dimensions of your rectangle makenzie what are the dimensions of the rectangle
look at your paper well 4 times 4 times 6 for by 6 okay 4 times 6 or 4 by 6 isaac have a seat
so i am going to pretend this is my new candy bar there is not 6 pieces anymore are there no no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy are in this candy bar 644 by 64 times 6
michael honorable come on thank you michael thanks okay see when you are paying attention you are right on sit up straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6 right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie and only makenzie okay
alright if i were to find .
i want to separate this 4 by 6 rectangle into 2 equal pieces so makenzie and i have the same amount well let us see let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half
okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here and half over here okay so i have got one half here and one half here
alright so we have got this huge candy bar we just cut it in half right how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half prove it to me prove that we just cut this huge .
prove it i do not know if that is the right line i do not if i i cut it exactly i do not know if i cut it exactly in half
beautiful job excellent explanation absolutely right so let us count and make sure each side has 12 why is your hand raised honey i do not know i do not either let us let us count each half and make sure there is 12 in each half 12 count yours 456789101112 on one side and i know if there is 12 on one side . there has to be 12 on the other side because 12 +12 equals 24
24 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in listen to the conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil
take a pencil line right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares no we did not okay i am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount
we are each going to get 12 small pieces okay this is what i am going to do next so we all are we all on the same page now are we all on the same page now okay almost alright now i cut my candy bar in half and i gave half to makenzie so we are both going to get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay
now this is what i want you to do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units 24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way to give me 2 equal pieces i want .
i want a half look at your look at your paper i want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half so that both christian no christian does not like chocolate both michael and ayana get equal number of pieces go ahead go to your next rectangle go to your next rectangle
nope i want halves i want to see halves go to your next rectangle okay waiting for you find a new way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar okay well you know what
i am going to get a different example not chocolate bar for you okay christian maybe it maybe it will be pizza okay let us see i want to see another way to make one half on your paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one i label this half and this half
and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar okay did you find a new way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing
because if they are not something needs to be done about it isaac what is wrong nothing okay okay let us see if we found a different way
vertically up and down in half he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half
he cut it in half i know there is 1224681012 here so there must be 24681012 here what is wrong 0 the there you need to write the the how many squares are in that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in who knows what is wrong
what is wrong makenzie
0 what is wrong one halfs are in the wrong position
on the top and on the bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did good job you just labeled it wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
nice job makenzie let us see yours same way yeah i did mine diagonally did you label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job 0 d let us think about that would diagonal count let us let us think about it that is a good question
who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half what do you think do you have the same number on top and on bottom no yes absolutely good look at me nice job nice job
if you are cutting something in half if you take it diagonally and they are the same number on one side as there re on the other side it is definitely halves
i split one whole okay so on top you would right one half and on the bottom you would write one half 0 i did that i did that
does anybody have a different way i did diagonal no other ways to make half and half let me ask you a question 0 sit down please ayana it is not a talent show it is not a fashion show have a seat alright yes christian said well what about diagonally the other way would that work yeah
absolutely okay would it be like possible to like make a circle and then hm probably not a circle probably not a circle now let me ask you a question can we put the plus sign how many small squares in each half you guys should know that right now how many small squares how many square units are in each half 12 thank you michael 12 here and 12 here why
because 12 +12 equals 24 alright so if you have 24 small squares in one side in one half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half do you still have halves know i mean yes yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2
and there is 8 and there is and there is watch 2 how much do we have to split it in can you just hold on a 2nd hold on a sec ayana hold on a sec means stop okay okay
take a look at what i did cheyenne
let us look let us count you ready
123456789101112123456789101112 so is that half yes absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles so what do you think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge i challenge you to make one more different way one more different half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other i challenge you
did you make sure that you counted and there are 12 in each side or each piece has 12
can we shade it in i know one where is wait where is you one half i do not see that you separated this rectangle anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
if you find another way i want you to try one more way okay be right back how we doing girls good how is this group doing good you doing okay huh where is is savannah your group yeah nice job did you guys go through the cards once yeah did you win no no did savannah win
yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time yeah who won 0 congratulations yeah i got like 4 okay i kept on guessing but i got it this group all set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed
it said something it said something that is on the top i do not think it said that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator what is a benchmark well where are your what are your matches show me your matches we just put them down 0 you just put them down did everybody check each other is work yes okay
you show me you can put them all flip them all over right now and just match them for me so i can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are okay flip em all over good put them in matches you too do the same thing flip them all over and put them in matches yeah can i get a band aid a band aid what happened honey
wash your hands with soap and water i will be right over
yep that is what it says awesome centers are almost over 5 minutes what honey there are 4 centers i did not say you were going to do them all today 0 miss richards i found 2 ways ooh show me i did this yay i did this
show me 0 that is awesome yes alright let us see christian show us yours okay so 1st you know what i am just going to go over it with green so we can see it okay kay did you check to make sure there is 12 in each yeah
awesome and which which other ones 123456789101112 nice job christian woah did you say you did 2 more 0 well hold on to that one everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana
so right here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper you have made a half christian 2 halves make a whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals 11 whole you made another one let us see
123456789101112 nice job ayana show everybody guys take a look at ayana is 12 good work did you do another one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you any more
and there is even 12 in this in this box i did this what
yep okay and the other halves did you make another one i want to make another one i want to see one more from you makenzie i am not sure what you are doing over there but you are you are i made 2 writing numbers like crazy show me what you are doing
what is this one
it is kind of like similar kind of like similar i hope you are making halves and not fourths or 20 fourths like this you have got you have made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay
as many pieces as you cut your whole into christian no it is not because you have made look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece 0 get it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
you definitely have to get rid of the lines i would just get rid of the let me see which 11234567891011 twelfths nice job 12s what did i say 12 square units one half you have made half this is way easy i am so glad that it is way easy this it is easier than way easy this is not half sweetheart halves are 2 pieces to make one whole
you have got more than 2 pieces here right yeah .
you have got to take everything out except for the one line that you are using to cut your 4 by 6 rectangle in half okay where do we go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit come over here okay i did one hold on where show me
i just made another one i do not under i do not see the halves did you do this boom boom boom boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope
you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see
123456789101112
alright you guys listen how many people i need you to sit down ayana but you know what cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table have a seat have a seat that is okay that is alright it is okay we are learning and sharing okay what do we do
no but sweetheart once you stop right here and here that is your piece you can use halves but it has to equal 12 square units so this only equals 12345 wholes and a half is 6 that is only 6 square units not 12 this
you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next nicholas are you all set all set okay listen up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now
i am going to challenge you and i am going to walk away your challenge put your hand down to fill the rest of these nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay listen listen listen 1st i will come over and look at yours in a sec but do not we need different numbers listen
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2 cause the denominator is going to be 4
you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch watch you made halves like this right yes i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths
and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them 4 no i mean 66 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into 4s fourths but the same is 6 and the number of square units is 6 that is right do we have a number yep we do
alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me that is hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them okay if you need more paper it is here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
let me see that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i i just made a new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 123456789101112
0 right here okay i see that now good job makenzie excellent excellent you got halves and you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here fourths makenzie here you go honey i do not know what is going on here but i am i am hoping it has to do with your center lovely kay guys i did it are you finished with your centers
yes lovely i did it but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction adam are you all set yes yes what happened 0 i i put my chair back and it hit the desk did he injure you in any way no thank goodness scoot in excuse me miss richards
because it says to no i gave you this paper in case you needed scrap okay this is the paper if you needed scrap paper okay that is fine that is fine
i know go sit down i know i know what isaac is doing
now you have fourths this is going straight down okay that is fourths my guy that is fourths good job yep okay i told this group to bring do you have all your matches together and you have all your matches together let us see if they isaac go have a seat
finish your center you have got 3 minutes
let us read i do have my glasses did you help i hope you helped over here okay a number that has a whole number and a fraction a whole number and a fraction is that called a look at me is that called simplest form what is that called mixed number oops let us fix that one okay
you have a sheet please
so this is number 312 recording today is february 8th is that right and it is 11 30 this is math time okay let us see
so i think you still remember this and we are just going to quickly go over what we have covered last time or yesterday okay does anyone remember what jackie said about these numbers comparing these 2 neighborhoods okay someone besides jackie okay cole the white cells you add up the yes and the no for a total and that would be equal to 100
so it would be 3.01 over 100
okay unintelligible to add up and then to see at over 70 okay
okay unintelligible a 100 over 34 over 100 okay so what makes this easier for us to compare percent okay kevin because what about the denominator they share the same denominator they share the same denominator right
okay so this is 100s this is also okay in 100s and which one is larger now louis unintelligible right
okay so that and that means and then the next thing we said last time was when something is out of 100 or per 100 okay amy what do we call that do you remember per percento percent right so what percent is this 31% this is 31% okay and dylan
34% this is 34% of the people who said yes right yeah okay so now can we compare yes this is very easy to compare right yes so this neighborhood had more people who said yes okay but if you just look at the numbers 31 17 it is very easy to say 0 yeah of course this is more 31 but then that is 17
okay but in fact you have to look at the whole thing right everything okay so remember this and this is one strategy when you compare percents or change fractions into percents
this is one way okay maybe i will have you write down some methods or strategies in your notebook okay and what is this strategy okay can someone explain this
so how do you turn this fraction into a percent or how do we turn these numbers you know 31 out of the total into a percent selina we divide the denominator by the numerator okay did we divide we did not divide yeah so what did we do unintelligible
add the yes and you add the no together and then if it is a 100 then we can put the yes on top of the no okay so we make a fraction that has a denominator of what okay a fraction with a denominator of okay 100 right
so this is for converting for making a percent okay all right what is another one so as long as we can get a denominator to be equal to 100 and we have the equivalent fraction then we have the percent okay is there another way to make this
did we do something else here here is another fraction what happened there we made an equivalent fraction right we made an equivalent fraction okay so how should we word this
okay like make equivalent fraction right and what about that equivalent fraction it has to have a numerator a denominator of .
okay with a denominator okay of 100 and can you write this word down i do not know if you have heard of this okay this is called scale or scaling scale up scale down
it is like you know simplifying finding equivalent fraction okay so here the example would be okay we scaled 17 over 50 up to 34 over 100 okay does that make sense okay why do you think we use the word scale
do you remember when we used have we used this word before in science math
what else
okay so you can scale up right and you can scale down okay but why scale where else did we use scale back in the fall maps maps right remember those maps you made okay the large ones you scaled them down to smaller versions right so that is kind of scaling and when you scale what happens do you change the shape or the you know the color
okay you basically ..
you just change the size and everything stays the same right when you scale something down it still looks the same as the original but smaller okay so when we scale the fraction up what does that mean it is still the same fraction but you know it kind of it looks larger but it is not really larger when you look at the ratio so if this is maybe i can give you an example
one to 2 we can scale it up to how can we make a percent percent 10 over 20 does that help us make the percent remember per 100 okay we want a numerator denominator of 100 right
okay now we scale this up to 50 over 100 but if you look at the relationship this is a one to 2 this is half of that right now is that half of that yes they are still the same they are still equal okay right so kind of get used to this word okay scale up scale down okay when you scale down what does that mean let me give you an example okay
so 15 over 18 okay maybe divide it by 6 okay so this is scaling down right it is like simplifying okay
and sometimes actually this is not a good example we will look at it in a few minutes sometimes you will have to scale down okay in order to scale up to go to 100 but this actually does not this is not a good example let me give you another one see if this works
no how about how about this so how can we turn this into 100 or is it possible or is it not possible not possible 12 does not go into 100 evenly right okay
does this make sense yes so scale down and then scale up okay okay sometimes you will have to do that you simplify it and then you will be able to find the 100 okay as the denominator in this case okay it does not work and we will come back to this okay so we will talk about that and that will be actually our strategy number 3 okay
so 12 and we will come back to this okay now yesterday you also did a fraction bar or a percent bar okay so let us take a quick look at number one
and what is the total what is the 100% what number for yao ming 7474 no what is the number what is the number of 3 what are the number of attempts 371371 right is that right yeah okay and for shaquille 0 neal the total 725725 okay
so can we just kind of look at this and figure out a strategy for estimating or calculating the percentage of free throws okay so how many did yao ming make 301 301 okay and how many did shaquille make 451
451 so by just looking at the numbers can we say 0 of course shaquille 0 neal is a better is better at free throw no okay and why not okay dylan why not
okay did you say 451 out of 725 yes and this is out of 771 and you said that the gap you mean the difference between these 2 okay it is bigger than this okay all right do you agree or disagree so when we look at these numbers we can not just say 0 451 is more you know
but we have to look at the total right the total okay so what are some strategies for estimating what are some strategies we want to find out the the percent right so what are some strategies yes how about using a benchmark number how about using landmark or benchmark numbers right okay so how do you what what is a good number to to round to
300 is this close to 300 yes and we say well let us try 300 okay out of now remember we have to find numbers that are easy to work with okay not just numbers that are very close so we have 370 350 400 okay so what is a what is a good number to use
350 how about 350 let us try 350 okay now 300 out of 350 okay so what can we divide this into okay lawrence we divide it into sevenths okay does that work sevenths yes so 123456 sevenths okay
and where would the 300 be 6 sevenths well if we divide this into 3 sevenths the 1st one would be 5050 right okay 12 350 200 300 300 okay and this is 350 so it would be somewhere over here right yes okay so let us put a star here
okay what about this number what numbers can we use 450 okay does 450 work over 7 750 okay now remember we we want to find numbers that are easy to work with 750 okay 750
can we okay 7 720 well that is close i do not know if that will work why did say why did someone say 720 i think that is a very good number to use i said 720 because it is a multiple of a number
720 is a multiple of a number what number a multiple of 566 129 how about this one we want the same multiple right we want to be able to find you know to to scale it down or up 99 is that a multiple of 9 yes 9 yes 5 so does that mean we can do 9s yes
0 yeah okay i am not very good at 9s but 0 that does not work so what what is what are some strategies remember we talked about making 9s by the thirds thirds very good okay and then into thirds again right yes much better
okay so where is 7 where is 720 it would be right here what about 450 if these are 9s you divide 720 by 9 so each one is 505090908080 right 8 times 9 is 7 72
so 80 160 and where would 450 be number 44 right there 40480 right in the middle of the 480 right in the middle of the 100 around here okay all right let us get the rest of these so what is the next 156560 and 640
640 right so where is 450 between 400 and 40 and 180 right there somewhere over there okay it is 140 all right okay so it is closer all right it is closer to 100 okay
so i i think these are very close estimates and can we tell by just looking at the 2 lines that yao ming is actually closer to 100% than shaquille 0 neal okay so there is another strategy you make a fraction bar or a percent bar okay now what about the let us see what about half
so did anyone use other strategies you say i am not going to do rounding maybe i will do halves i will do use benchmark fractions does that work so let us say this is yao this is yao ming is 371 shaquille is 725 can we use some benchmarks so here says what would be 50%
50% that is half and what number would that be about about 118518185180 is that about 185 is that close enough yes okay and what about here 36360 about 3622 okay 365 all right
so how does this help now we know half way is about 150 185 and then that is about 360 does that help can that help us figure out you know where each person was no no what are we trying to find
we are trying to find a spot for that number right where does 301 belong on this line does this help us no well can we at least say that it is on this side or it is on this side yes yeah it is on this side right and how about shaquille it is also on the right so that does not really help
0 good idea okay so now let us do fourths now what would be half half of that 92 okay 92 and this is about 180 yeah close enough okay so 184 okay how about over here you want to be exact okay all right
how about over here so we add another 4292 to that right 272270 272 and here 5454340 wow okay now can does this help where is 301 half and a half
it would be between 272 and 371 right yes so somewhere over here how about 451 in between yeah it would be between these 2 between one half and 3 fourths so so does this help us yes yes okay
yes i was exact right okay so if you use benchmark numbers you should be able to okay let us say if this does not work then we can break it down into even smaller parts right but this strategy works okay so we use a fraction the percent bar okay let us let us take a look at that that last one and i think that is a very good question do you agree or do you disagree
okay this person alicia said yao ming made 301 free throws and shaquille 0 neal made 451 so shaquille 0 neal has the better record okay agree disagree okay raise your hand marlene
i disagree because shaquille 0 neal had an elbow but not shaquille so so you disagree that means what does that mean that yao ming has a better record yes okay does anyone disagree with marlene is statement
and that means you agree with alicia is in other words can we say that shaquille actually has the better record no so you all agree with marlene yes okay but what is the difference if you look at these 2 numbers
just the ones in purple not the denominator just the what are these numbers these are the free throws that they made right so he made yao ming made that many shaquille 0 neal made that many is it possible to argue that he is better he has a better record yes because you it depends because you do not know the denominator
okay all right because you do not know the denominator because well we do know do not we we do know okay yes but it you know we do know the denominator so yes
i just i recognize this right now but like you could say that yao ming has more because if you -3 72 301 then you only have like only like 70 left like any missed
and then if you -125 or 451 you will have a lot more than okay how many 202 hundered and 76
okay so you are saying that shaquille missed many more shots than yao ming so he is better okay is that right yeah in terms of okay anyone else any other comments well i actually noticed something about finding the percentage okay
that the lower the number the low the lower the numerator and denominator is the higher percentage okay say that one more time please the high the lower the numerator and denominator are the higher the percentage is
okay the lower the denominator then the cole the denominator yeah and the numerator 0 and the numerator the higher the percentage it is okay i do not quite understand what do you mean the lower so how about fraction like 13rd these are low right
does that mean it is a higher percentage what determines i think cole brought up a good point okay what determines the the higher a higher percentage how do we know that it is a higher percentage just by looking at the numerator and the denominator is there a way to tell is there a way to tell yeah rachel
a higher numerator because then no the numerator should be very high because it has to be like close to the numerator to the denominator say that one more time for me it has to be of course the numerator to the denominator okay so can we say that when the numerator is very close to the denominator that the percentage is higher yes okay all right keep that in mind okay i think that is a very good point
okay so what i would like you to think about now is the other strategies that you wrote down okay the 2nd and the 3rd okay so this is one strategy right so we actually did we write that down estimate rounding
okay maybe we can write this down too okay so this is not finding the exact percentage but we can estimate right by by what
yes by rounding and using benchmark numbers yes okay all right so this is a strategy for estimating not finding the exact okay
so let us think about what let us see what i wrote up here okay so i will i will transfer this over okay you all set with this okay when you estimate you round we can also use i think we did use .
fraction or percent bars right okay what happens when you have when you cannot use any any of these strategies okay let us say there is a fraction but you can not round the you can not make the numerator into 100
you cannot scale up or down you know to get to 100 and and then you cannot estimate because you want the exact answer okay then what do you do let me give you a simple example how about one out of 3 can we scale this up or down to make this 100 into 100
yes or no yes okay how does this work boys and girls no we can have 26s 39s one over 30 but how do we get to a 100 we can not not close to 33 right not evenly right okay
so this is an example now what happens when you need to make a percent then you you can not estimate then it is that is a problem okay and this is when the next strategy comes in handy okay so say that one more time okay yeah
all right okay selina said you can divide a numerator okay and please write this down divide a denominator and when you do that remember we did this before yes what do you get when you do that
you have a decimal right okay so when you have the decimal and then what how do you make it into a percent you turn it into a percent okay and we will we will practice okay did you write this down
okay so when you cannot do any of the other use any of the other strategies you use this one okay and and it always works okay with this one you divide a numerator by the denominator okay then you look at this let us look at the same example they are all one over 3 okay so it is 3 divided by one so it is 33% no it is 33
well one out of 3 how can that be 3% right that does not make sense because you do 3 divided by one are we dividing 3 by one no okay i know it does not look very it does not look right but we remember this when we did this when you write the fraction this way dylan yeah
one divided one over 3 and what does this symbol mean divide on the keyboard the computer keyboard that means divide right so when you write you can write it like this so this is the same as that same as that right yes or no yes does this make sense yes so how do you divide one by 30
and i think we did this okay put a 0 put a 0 so this is one and 0 tenths 3 goes into 10th that how many times 33 tenths right no so this is 110th if we do the standard way then what happens after a while you notice that it repeats right
okay so whenever it repeats then you do not have to go on because it will not stop okay and we put the little line okay above this and that means it repeats okay so 13rd is the same as 0.30.3 with that bar notation okay at the top
now that is only a decimal so how do we turn the decimal into a percent we move the decimal if you do not put you move 2 spaces back which is it is 0.33 that is 33 but since it is only .3 you put 13rd into it
so since it is all over here there is 0.33 and behind the decimal points it also makes a percent so we need to move that okay and that is what we did i think last month instead of writing the decimal especially when it repeats we made we did not use the remainder right what happened marlene
so we turned that into a fraction a fraction okay now this repeats so this is a remainder i am not going to continue because it does not stop okay and then what do you do you put the 13rd at the top here right and 3rd so this decimal is and is it should we do 0.3 and a 3rd no
or 3333 okay 33 because we as jackie said you have to move the decimal point how many spaces 22 okay to the right right okay so that means over okay so this is the exact decimal right
that is not estimating that is not rounding and you turn it into a percent 33 okay and of course you think about it does it make sense 13rd is that about 33% 333333 that is about a 100 right okay
all right so let me have you practice okay take a look at the next page and remember sometimes okay you have to scale up scale down and if it does not work then you use this last strategy okay on page 57 the portland tigers are playing the cold water colts colts in basketball
the game is tied 58 to 58 but in the excitement both coaches step onto the court just as the buzzer sounds a referee calls a technical foul on each coach so each coach has to choose one player to make the free throw attempt the winning team may be determined by the free throw and the question is you know who does the coach choose right
and here are some statistics so for angela angela is history okay when you know she made the free throw so she made 12 out of 15 free throws emily made 15 out of 20 christina 13 out of 16
so which player should the coach select to make the free throw attempt and explain your reasoning okay so i want you to do this in your notebook i want you to figure out you know each one and maybe what is the strategy how do we i mean can we just look at these numbers and say 0 this is the best person in free throw so what do you do we have to show our work
okay you show your work show your thinking but how do you determine you know who okay so you will have to do some math to find percent right or equivalent fraction so you can compare okay lawrence can you make them so they have numerators of a 100 okay you can try to make them so that they all have a 100
you know as a numerator denominator or numerator denominator denominator okay so go ahead and do it in your notebook okay and let me know if you have any questions
okay isabella why are you multiplying this by 20 because 150 probably 15 equals 4 and to get one a denominator of 100 you have to multiply by 20 so when you multiply something by 20 does it get 20 times as much no it stays the same because we are scaling up
okay i see what you are doing but if you write it like this that means you multiply this by 20 that means you make this 20 times more so what is the what is the right way to write that you multiply this by 20 and you multiply this by 20 also like a numerator and how is that different 20 versus 20 over 20
because that shows that you are multiplying each one by 20 if you do that you are just multiplying that whole thing 20 times 20 times right okay why do you think christina is the best at free throw yeah because they are both the same because the quickest way to do it that i found out was 3 +3 equals 16 that is 2 it is the easy way
if you use if 13 goes into 16 even if these 2 have 3 she had more time to go for free throws than 13 so she got 13 out of 16 and it would be a little it would just be a little bit the percentage would just be a little bit more than this because this has a more because she had more time and then she had 13 okay
they had different right that is very good thinking but if you look at the the numbers of attempts okay they all did different they they they used different numbers right yes so how can you figure out the exact percent for angela the exact for emily can you use any of those strategies
you could divide the denominator by the denominator okay now before you do that can we use the other strategies sometimes those are easier okay than dividing right remember we are trying to find fractions that have a denominator of of 150 or like a benchmark 25 right yes so can you turn that into a 100 is that 12 out of 15
maybe you can write it down and yeah put it on this page so we can see so for angela 12 out of 15
15
can you turn 15 12 over 15 into something over 100 does 15 go into 100 evenly no no right so that 1st strategy okay that does not work can we try the try the other one try to scale it up scale it down down and up
if you scale it up it would be 24 over 30 right but will you eventually get to 100 try to scale it down and see if that works
so do 12 over 15 equal
okay are you trying to use a percent bar yeah that is okay because 15 goes into 106 times is it exactly 6 times no okay but we want exact numbers is there another way to remember the strategies that we talked about like 15 to 10 and then
yeah can you try to scale it up scale it down yeah sometimes you will have to go down before you can go up see that good because 5 times 20 equals
yes and 3 times 20 equals 60 okay now why is that a 3 because 12 times 4 okay and a 3 times 4 equals 12 right so 5 times 4 is that 20 that is not 20
okay check this 12 over 15 this is dividing by 3 right this is dividing by 3 so when you divide 15 by 3 it is 5 when you divide 12 by 30 so 4
does that work so how many percent is that 80% good so that is an example of scaling down okay in order to go back up right
good good okay how did you do this one ming the common factor okay so what do you mean tell me more what do you mean common factor is that emily 15 out of 20 so what is that 15 out of 20
so 0 i see can you do a fraction line a fraction bar so you see a fraction in other words you turn that into a fraction does that work little boy i did 20 out of 15 out of 15 i made this 20 because if it is rounded down it will be 10 okay so i got 200 and now now we can not round okay why not we need the exact number right
okay so when you round you estimate so we are not estimating can you write that fraction here 12 over 15 equal and we are trying to find a fraction that has a 100 at the bottom right it is not a factor of a 100 it is good so then so let us try those strategies how about the 2nd one
by scaling can you scale down scale down that means make these 2 numbers smaller but yet they still equal the same okay good good okay do you think that works yeah
so i have 100 times 12 and what times 12 i have 100 times 12 did you get that exactly and what percent is that 80% so this is a case when you have to round that not round but scale them before you can get to 100 right that is good
so so angela that is 80% okay can you explain this to me this is 15 over 20 20 so these are common factors they both have 5 good so 15 times 5 equals 75 so i turn it into a fraction 20 times 5 equals 100 so i turn this into a fraction okay
and then 75 out of 100 that is 75 75% very good are you trying to use the same way to find emily or are you using a different strategy okay i am using a all right remember i used the i did it let us see so this one is both and this one is okay what do you mean both tell me
because 15 out of i put equal because if i round it all up to the 20 so i put 15 +5 will equal 20 so i put 12 +5 now why did you round up when do we round remember when we do you need this i am all set you are set there yeah thank you okay i am going to recycle that okay thanks ms fong so why do you why why do you need to round
we are not rounding are we when are we estimating here so this is not estimating okay so you can not round but can can you write it as a fraction ms fong just put put it down here okay so 12 out of 15 make a fraction it is not the same 12 over 15 good it is 2 away and can you use any of those strategies
scaling up and down turning the denominator into a 100 did that work can you tell me what you did
cause 12 over 15 equals 4 fifths 15th equals 8 over a 100 good and then now do you know the percent 8% good now okay so that is the 2nd strategy now what if this does not work then what do you have to do what is the last one divide the numerator
okay i need you to show your work how did you get 80% how did you get do not erase it just show how you got those numbers okay
what do you mean 5 emily has 5 left 5 shots so she missed 5 shots and then christina missed 33 so so you are trying to say that this person missed the least therefore
no because angela also missed 3 but christina had more free throws and angela had less so christina would have had a better chance okay now how about someone who missed one free throw do you think that would be like even better than christina i only missed one does that mean i am better than christina no no
but i only tried once 0 that does not yeah so what does that mean can we can you determine by these numbers the number that they missed carmen carmen or bobby carmen not right now dylan okay just wait please does that work bobby 10 attempts right carmen
so so how so what do you have to do you need to find the 8 out of 10 exact percent right 10 exact percent 18 out of 10 attempts can you go back and yep so angela is a 12 out of 15 can you write 12 over 15 exactly
you see that is a fraction out of this not out of the whole okay we are going to take a few more minutes boys and girls but i one thing i need you to do is to make sure that you write the fraction you show your work okay you that you do not estimate okay we are not estimating so you need the exact fraction percent
okay where is the 1st one all right so how many percent is this 75 okay and how did you know because i changed it into a fraction which is 3 fourths right so what is re this is 3 fourths how did you make that into a 34th i i scaled it to 66 over i believe 8
all right now 6 that is half of that right is 8 half of that no are we estimating yes okay so we can not use anything that is close to but i think you have the you have the right idea lewis so can you scale it differently okay maybe you can just write the fraction here and try to reduce it try to scale it
okay can you scale it down yes or simplify simplify it down to 6 okay okay does that work that is half of that and i do not think so half of 15 is that an even number no a whole number no so we can not do that
try another number you can do let us see 4 okay okay divided by 3 good so that is worth this right now does that help yes how do you go from here to the percent
how accurate are these parts is this exactly the same as that 80% okay good because these are very close and how do you know if you did these lines accurately you can tell that she is a little bit better than angela right but are you sure that you divided these evenly
that this is not a little bit more than that how about using some numbers this is a good strategy okay now since these are so close can you try to use some numbers to figure out
okay boys and girls we have a couple more minutes let me have your attention okay just for a minute up here all right we let us look at the problem okay so for angela okay since we are not estimating okay i need you to find the exact number okay so what is the what is the fraction there how many out of how many
okay kevin all right and you want to find a remember those strategies can we find a fraction that has a 100 yes okay so if 15 does 15 go into 100 evenly no okay if not then we will have to use another strategy right using the scaling up and down
so we can scale this down listening please simon scale it down to okay does that work divided by 3 divided by 3 and then can you scale it up 5 can go into 100 right okay and now we have a fraction
eyes up here alphonsus okay now for the other 2 people you need to do the same thing so emily and christina what do you notice about the last one okay can we use the same strategy
can we scale down can we scale up does 16 go into 100 now that means strategy one does not work strategy 2 does not work and we can not estimate that strategy 3 so we have to go to the last one right for something like this you will have to divide okay
and then you find a decimal turn it into like this
all right this is what we are going to be doing today that is okay she likes to be sat in closets all right today we are going to do a couple of things we talked a little bit about the area model on friday we just touched upon it we are going to we are going to do it today okay some of the kids had trouble in the other class
i am going to try to make it real simple okay hand down maneli and then we are going to also use estimation to help us get in the right ballpark as far as our answers go okay so i will move around i know the camera is in the way so let us talk about estimation 1st
take out your math notebooks and let us copy this problem down 25 x 84 okay benny you got a math notebook buddy
take it out okay we are going to estimate both of these numbers okay
why do you think estimation you should do it before you do every single multiplication problem why is it why is it a good strategy to do bella because it makes it easier because you will have even numbers okay but how is it going to help us like why why are we estimating why am i estimating right now before why do not why do not i just solve the problem
why do not i do 25 x 84 why am i making you do this extra step anybody know because it might help us how is it going to help us i already said it at the beginning of the class how is it going to help us maneli it is going to help explain what you are thinking or no it is not going to help explain my thinking patrick
it is going to help us because it makes it easier okay i need something a little more clearer than that benny like it it makes it easier how does it make it easier patrick to to make an estimation and make an estimation and get close to the answer
okay it is going to help us get close to the answer which will help us do what if we estimate it is going to help us get close to the actual answer why is that important why is that important so you can find the answer so we can find the answer because what i have been seeing a lot okay so let me do another problem right here
what i have been seeing a lot is when people are multiplying okay when people are multiplying say i have a problem and i am doing it this way 22 x 46 what i am seeing a lot is that people are not multiplying accurately so you are not doing say you did 80 instead of 800
well your answer is going to be way off so you need to recognize that you know what i need to add one more 0 there to make it 800 and i have seen it in the previous class i saw it a lot at the beginning and i am and i see it in this class as well
so if i estimate if i take 22 x 46 and i estimate that if i round the numbers up to 20 x 50 i know that my answer is going to be somewhere around a 1000
so whittler if i did make a mistake and i forgot to add a 0 and i did have 80 hopefully when i am done adding my products up i say to myself something is not right my estimate my estimation my estimate i am going to be close to a 1000 i am going to be around a 1000 i might be a little under i might be a little over
but i know i am not going to get an answer of say 220 so it is going to help you realize that when you are computing when you are multiplying your partial products together that you know what i think i might have left out a 0 i think i might have made a mistake so it will help us become more accurate so let us go back to the original does everybody understand that yes yes
okay so 25 x 84 when we estimate we round we have 2 digit numbers we are going to round to the nearest 10 25 30 30 good so let us put it underneath i like to write an e for estimate for an estimate just so you know so 30 okay 84 80
80 good ah multiplying with 0s right 3 x 8 somebody raise their hand and tell me 3 x 8 jenna 24 let us add the 2 0s 2400 so i know i am going to be somewhere around 2400 okay
one of the kids at the end of the class in the previous class one of the word problems on that paper that you have excuse me when he when he did it his estimate was actually the same as the actual answer sometimes it happens okay sometimes not all the time most of the times it will not so i know i am going to be 30 x 80 okay i want you to solve this problem
any way that you want any way that we practiced on friday okay let us go kyle solve it any way we want solve it any way you want i would like to see you use the rectangle okay that is the way we were practicing we are going to solve 25 x 84 now we do not solve the estimate
this is just to help us okay that is just to help us 25 x 84 i see ella is already working there 25 x 84 that is what you are solving right now 25 x 84
25 x 84 25 x 84 good 0 thank you keep on i am determined to use these papers keep on
do you have one okay is it all coming back to you now what was that long that those 2 days off there you go you ready to go
good just be accurate with your multiplication no no how can it be 40000 when our estimate is 2400 all right so let us 25 84
20 x 80 what is that 10000 no what is 2 x 80 16 how many 0s 16 are all . how many 0s are in the equation how many 0s 22 1600 right 20 x 4 what is 2 x 48 and add a 0 right 80 okay now we go to the bottom
5 x 8 is 40 5 x 80 yeah so 5 x 8 think of 5 x 8 basic fact add a 0 400 5 x 4 is 20 20 add those up add all these up yeah and plus yeah add yes and then this will be the answer that will be the answer yes just do not add up the numbers on the outside those are the numbers that you know add up these numbers
can i get them up right there okay 0 bottom right 5 x 80 5 x 4 right right you did the top now you have got to do the bottom
yeah nice good 0 sara sara sara sara sara 0 yeah thank you what did you do let me see 0 wait no you you made the boo boo right there i did too
no you were good do you recognize the boo boo recognize the mistake you said 5 x 80 is 40 last time i checked 5 x 8 is 40 good good i will be right there good good yeah no mistake right there
you have got to add all these up you have got it all right just add those up right go ahead keep on going good ah mistake right here 5 x 8 you have got to add that 0 right 84 is the number right you keep the numbers the same okay alright yeah there you go
what is 5 x 8 though 0 okay you have got to redo that i know 0 i love it i see the same mistake all the time and this is why i am going to show you the area model 840 no 0 you copied it different okay let me see yes you are right you are right good all right let us have okay
4 x 2 huh 8 4 x 2 me no her 4 x 2 4 x 2 4 488 so that should be 8 right all right whittler let me see 0 you added wrong bring your bring your paper up
yeah yeah add them up and you get your answer okay whittler tell us what you multiplied have a seat i multiplied 20 x 80
yes and what did we get as an answer 1600 1600 somebody refresh my memory about what the estimate was what did we say the estimate was sara 2400 2400 i am going to just write that up here this is our estimate okay what did we multiply next we multiplied 5 x 4 we got 20 okay 5 x 4 you got 20
continue then we multiplied 5 x 80 yes we got 400 good then we multiplied 20 x . 20 x what 20 x 4 and you got 8 okay we added those up and the answer is 2100 our estimate was 2400
are we in the right ballpark yes yes we are so i feel comfortable with that answer all right now this is what i saw a lot this is why i am going to show you the area model today this is what i saw from at least 3 different people you did 5 x 80 and you put 40 you just did the basic fact of 5 x 8
you did not add the 0 from the 80 to get 400 okay so that is a mistake that a lot of people make just because you are going and sometimes you forget well if we look at the area model here i know i talked a little bit about it on friday somebody refresh my memory about how the area model you can go back to your seat thank you
actually keep your notebook there for a 2nd i will give it back to you you can sit down so you can see this how the area model here is different from the strategy on the board how is the area model different from the strategy on the board patrick can you answer
the numbers are probably like 20 will be bigger and 10 times will be smaller okay he is on the i know what he is saying but let us get it exact okay you heard what patrick says you know what he means but let us say it exactly the way it should be bella
you did 30 going down and you did so that means you did one going down right 5 yes so would it be like area basically the length and the width are going to be i am looking for a word it is going to be what another word for precise that begins with an a
exact no that is an e but that is another word an a it is going to be what the length and the width are going to be accurate accurate accurate yes the length and the width are going to be accurate the rectangles inside the area model are going to show what they are really supposed to look like so when i multiply with this one they do 38 x 26
so when i do 30 x 20 the answer is 600 the value of that product is going to look bigger than the other ones because i am multiplying the 2 biggest numbers together with this one up here okay this one is kind of like what they call the partial product okay we just write the equations
now we do it in that rectangle because you guys and gals were having a hard time figuring out what numbers to multiply so that is a strategy that helps us organize the partial product okay this one is showing how big the rectangles inside the area should be
so when i am doing 30 x 20 hopefully if i put 60 there i realize that whoa that rectangle is way too big to be 60 it should be 600 i must have forgot to add a 0 well this little one i am going to know where to put that equation of 8 x 6 8 x 6 is by far the smallest equation there so it better go in the small rectangle right in the bottom right
so we are going to learn how to make the area model today okay and if you like the area model you can continue using it if you do not like it you can go back to using the partial product either way you just have to be accurate you have to recognize your mistakes when you make one so if i left out a 0 i know that i have to add that 0 okay does everybody understand that yes
okay let me show you an example of what one of the kids did in class that way i can show you what we did they had some trouble with this i am not sure why they just were not very accurate when they were counting
so our goal today is to make the area model as you can see up here now this is an area model of 38 x 12
okay and if we get the hang of this then i will break you up into your groups you can solve the word problems on your desk in your groups and then you can have all the work if we have time okay we will have time this afternoon as well so look at what one of the students did the problem was 38 x 12
okay so the length they did 30 they separated according to place value right 38 i am just going to make a little line there i will do a plus sign 30 +8 is 38 right expanded notation so they counted 30 alana and tiana
30 down with one color and then 8 down with another so we separated the 10s place from the ones place there does everybody see that does that seem overly difficult no okay good so we all feel comfortable counting yes good you would be surprised at what i saw last class all right now we go over to the next one the 2nd number is 12
so again she separated according to place value she did 10 across and then 2 across okay now i used grid paper for this to help us out you do not need to color in the boxes all you do is you make a line so if the number is 38 i do 30 with one color and then 8 with another and then i can use the same 2 colors for the width or i could use 2 different colors
it does not matter and i went 10 across and then she went 10 across and then 2 across now the reason why we use 2 different colors where the 10s place and ones place meet is right here this section right here separates the 10s place from the ones place so what we do is we draw a line there
and that will help us get the correct areas for each equation that we multiply so when she did 10 x 8 say you did not know your facts at all but you could make the area model 10 x 8 there is going to be 80 little squares in here so you can literally count them 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and you can get your answer
okay and it is going to help you because if you get stuck and you are like mister porter i do not know what numbers i have to add would it make sense if you did 8 x 10 in this rectangle right here okay that has 80 boxes 8 x 10 is 80 8 x 2 is 16 if you came up here and you counted that there would be 16 boxes
now the horizontal line where the 2 different colors meet is where you draw your line going up it is that simple any questions about that i had kids just to warn you i had kids making the line the vertical line anywhere they wanted to they were not doing it where the 2 colors met they just put it here
so when they went to go do it it did not look right it was not accurate if i counted those squares there should be 80 squares here if we counted this there should be 300 squares in that rectangle right there because that is the area that is the length and the width of this rectangle there should be 60 squares here so this is going to be a lot more accurate than doing it with the partial product in the rectangle okay
so we are going to do a couple of problems i am going to pass out this type of paper okay everybody understand yes okay we are going to do the 1st one together if i feel like we are getting it and we can do it then i am going to break you up into your groups okay and you are going to use the area model to help you solve the word problems
and some of you i have different word problems for different groups okay some of you i might give a bigger problem too once we do it with the centimeter paper here okay once we are done with that then we can move on to doing it without it just using a regular piece of paper okay so we will talk about that as well
all right so let us see sarah i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody emily i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody so everybody should have 2 pieces of paper okay
the goal is to be so good at making the area model you can do it as quick as making the other rectangle okay now i am going to show you when i do it on the board i am not going to use any graph paper to help me make sure you do not forget benny in the back
okay so take out 2 colored crayons 32 x 24 let us write the problem at the top of your paper you do not have to write it super big so you take up the whole paper sara can you give them another one thank you is that for whoever is like watching us
yeah they are watching you right now point down they are watching me more than they are watching you what they are watching me teach more than they are watching you they are not watching the program they are showing how i teach okay okay so 32 x 24 watch what i do 1st before we even begin we are going to estimate
because when we estimate it is going to help us get in the right ballpark help us know where our answer should be round not exactly so 32 alex what am i going to round 32 to what number 30 30 good 24 chris 20 200 that is nice and easy
and once you get good at estimating it is something that you can just do in your head you can look at the problem and solve it in your head some of you can some of you might take a little more practice 30 x 62600 see how quick you did that right so our answer is going to be around 600 let me ask you this question is it going to be smaller or larger than 600 why and tell me why
why is our answer going to be smaller or larger than 600 why jasmine we have not heard from you all day jasmine why is our number is our actual answer going to be smaller or larger larger why is it going to be larger
say that again i only rounded the 10s so you said i only rounded the 10s and you have to round the ones ah i need something else something else who can tell me alex we rounded down with both of the numbers there you go we rounded down with both of the numbers the actual numbers are 32 come on people 32 so they are larger
they are larger so of course our answer is going to be larger okay our actual numbers 32 and 24 are both larger than 30 and 20 so our answer is going to be greater than 600 if you had an answer smaller than 600 that should raise a red flag okay red flag loosen up people my goodness i should have the camera emily who is also well behaved
all right 32 x 24 so what you are going to do is you are going to take a color you are not going to color in any of the squares there you are going to count 30 now i am going to do it without it and my rectangle that i make my area is going to look just like yours
we are going to do 30 down so count 30 draw a line and then label it and then you are going to take a different color and you are just going to do 2 because that would represent the ones place and then you are going to do 2 so i have 32
now you can do this without actually drawing without using graph paper once you get the handle of it now obviously 30 is going to be a lot greater than 2 okay everybody have that yes no no 30 down honey you have got to count 30 down draw a line right on the line there you go is it like this is it 30 that does not look like 30 to me 30 down
do you have 30 down i am going to trust you there good now draw 2 down yes sure okay 30 now draw a different color is that a different color use a different color for those 2 and write 2 now my only question is you did it so far over here i do not think you are going to have room to draw 24 going in a horizontal line right
try it on the back and start on the left you do not look like you where do you want to go i did not . where is 30 30 down 30 down a line 30 down can you count 30 down go ahead start at yeah there you go where is my 30 that is not 30 honey you are drawing a line 30 down do you see my line
a vertical line going 30 down yes okay that does not look like 30 to me my dear let us count that count that one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 you have 14 there i actually want 30 i want a line of 30 and then with another color a line of 2 bella do you have it
let me see yes why why are you coloring that in i just want a line a line kids this is what i want to see my goodness see i told you a line see that she has a line of 30 i can walk by and i notice that she has a line of 30 with another color she did a line of 2 any concerns right now
who can not draw a line count by 30 going down if you need help please raise your hand i will be more than happy to help you here is my 30 okay because i am not seeing it my 30 it looks okay from the yeah i see it i can tell here is my 20 yeah now what bella is going to do is she is going to take a color and the number is 24
so she is going to go 20 across actually count 20 not 15 not 10 not 19 20 and then she is going to stop she is going to use another color to count 4 so can we all make an l please yes go ahead thank you thank you you can still do it that looks much better i can tell right now yes
0 sorry we have to do 20 that looks more than 30 can you count 30 man come on 123456 is that 20 yeah good so write 20 right there now with another color make 4 separating the 10th place from the one place from right extended yeah
no 4 go on continue it there you go good write 4 right there there you go perfect okay so that is what ella just did okay 32 then she has 20 across and then 4 across good
yeah right now all ella has to do she is basically done is she just has to close up the area model so she just takes any color she wants and she is going to close up the rectangle so she is going to take a color she is going to draw up and over so now we have a rectangle can we do that yes okay make it happen
you have a question anybody we are doing 20 on the bottom yeah we are doing 24 we are making 32 by 24 array basically okay did you have enough room you did
good is that 20 now you have to do another 4 square yeah because we are doing the number 24 and you will be okay so do not worry about it all right 32 24
even though i think that is more than 30 buddy but that is okay no okay now you think it is more than 30 yes there is 10 20 there is 30 right there that is where 30 should be so there is 30 here is 2
so this is where it should be right here okay you see that you see that okay once you have made your rectangle close it up that looks no 241 number 20
1234 okay now i have chris is paper right here chris closed up he has an array now all right that is what we are doing is we are making an array
now the reason why i had you use different colors is so you know where to draw the lines so he has orange and red here so where his orange and red vertical line meet he is going to draw a line going across straight across it does not matter what color it is hopefully he will draw it straighter than i just did hey hey hey that was not good
so he is going to draw it across on the line and then where his horizontal line is is where the 20 meets the 4 it is tough to tell here okay let me write it up okay right here see it is easy i just counted he is going to draw a line going up
now if he solves it rightly if he counted this he will be able to accurately know the product for each equation that he is going to make does everybody understand that yes okay so draw you are going to draw a horizontal and a vertical line if you do not know good perfect let me see yours
vertical and horizontal okay vertical astronaut remember astronauts sleep because in space because of . gravity no gravity okay that is perfect right there now when she multiplies i hope she is going to realize where she puts 2 x 4 yes right
and if you put 2 x 4 in this rectangle right here we have some . big problem we have a little bit of concern right so this is going to help us accurately find the answer to the product to each of the rectangles notice how we have 4 rectangles so you are going to have 4 equations
you can write the equation right inside each of them maybe not that one because it is so small okay there you go calista i will be right back is this perfect yes perfect yes now multiply them together you made a loop you are not going to be and you can still get the answer but you do not have 32 here you have 31
see that how you only have one right there see how he has 2 rows right 0 yeah you can still figure it out dominic can i help you no dominic you do not do that huh who ellis emily is this is emily is yes that is ellis and this is emily is perfect
okay multiply them together okay see what you have right here draw a line here all the way across and draw a line here okay you got it now we have 4 rectangles right what is 2 x 4 watch if i do not know look i can count
2468 is my answer right yeah it is right there it is perfect perfect now solve it solve it so right here then you just count up from this line do 30 x 20 honey okay
yeah perfect how do i get it now can you do it for me okay everybody stop for a 2nd let us look at alex alex wrote 24 on the top and the bottom that is okay whatever helps kyle can you look here so we can do it right bud
all right so he did 30 x 20 now if i wanted to torture alex which i might later on i might have him count every single square here and if he counted every single square there would be 600 because 30 x 20 is 600 correct brianna yes awesome 600 i like how he wrote the equation inside the inside the rectangle okay perfect so he has 4 arrays here
he has a 30 by 20 then below this he wrote 20 here look he is going to do 2 x 20 and he is going to have 40 if he counted each of those squares there would be 40 squares there so 2 x 20 is 40
so unlike using the rectangle or the box some people call it right which just has 4 even rectangles this is giving us the actual answer for each equation okay so if you did 30 x 20 and you forgot to add a 0 and you said 60 you should know that you made a mistake a big mistake look at how big this is
then 2 x 4 is a small equation and we have a small answer and we have a small rectangle there we have a small array right here 8 and then the last one 30 x 4 so he wrote it over here close to it that is okay 30 x 4 is 120 there is 120 squares right here in this array
does everybody see that yes question patrick yes yes okay i think we need to try at least one more so turn your paper over if you used both sides already then just get your other paper that is why i gave you 2 papers huh
okay i know i am walking around you do not have to show me what is the next one mister porter okay so the next one let us do a little bit smaller let us do 20 28 x 12
now before we begin we are going to estimate i always want you to yes we are going to do that you can do it here but do not do anything yet 1st we are going to estimate so write down the actual problem and then we are going to estimate you should always estimate before you solve the problem some of you chris i feel pretty confident that you could do that in your head right yes so i am going to put you to the test in a 2nd
so 28 chris rounded is what 30 30 10 i mean 12 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10 what is 30 x 10 300 300 see he did it in his head but i am writing it down so we know that 28 x 12 is going to be somewhere around 300 so if we have an answer like 3000 we know that we did something wrong
and if we can do the area model correctly we know that we are going to be extremely accurate and that we will not get it wrong so let us do 28 x 12 so that means 28 x 120 the pen do not feel me now his button is flashing is it
yeah the pen do not feel me i can not do that tapping thing there it goes okay 28 x 12 i am going to separate the 28 into a 20 +8 right expand it 4 i will even do a different color
so the 10s place is going to be a different color than the ones place that way i know where to draw the line once you get the hang of it you will not have to do that okay so 20 with one color so count down 20 i am going to use red so i am going to count down 20 right go ahead ella with a crayon
20 and then a different color i am going to color the ones place 8 not color but draw a line and i am going to label them so i have 28 same number 28 it is one number i am just separating the 10s place and the ones place okay
x 12 make sure you count it so 2 different colors there everybody see that like this just like if that is 28 then you did it right any questions horizontal line
i am going to do 12 so i might use the same 2 colors i might use 2 different colors it does not matter i am going to do 10 this time notice that my 10 here is a lot smaller than the 20 so the next step is doing this without graph paper you still want to be fairly accurate
and then 2 for the 12 so it is going to look a lot smaller i might even make it a little bit smaller okay so i have my l i am just going to finish making my array it does not matter what color it is
okay now where your 2 lines meet you are going to draw 2 lines horizontal line and i am going to draw my vertical line now even though i did not use graph paper i bet you your array that you just made is going to look a lot like mine i can look at bella is right now i can look at maneli right now
john is this whole row right here and theirs looks a lot like mine except the lines are straighter right okay so finish it off right here finish it off up and over perfect perfect now write your equations
okay okay label 28 good we will draw a line here and draw a line here okay right now you are good to go perfect
and if you get stuck you can count now do 10 and 2 up there and you can even do 10 and 2 down there it does not matter good when you have your area model set up solve the equation i just got here 0 you just got here 0 instrument people okay you are going to have to rely on jasmine to help you out here i like friday is
friday is my favorite okay instead of just making a rectangle like we did last week what we are doing is we are doing an area model so this is going to be the arrays are going to be exact so when i do 20 x 2 i know it is going to go right there i should have exactly 40 squares there 20 x 10 there is going to be 200 squares right here okay so it is going to look exactly the way it should be
the array is going to be accurate when we do this right all the rectangles are the same yeah i am good okay before the camera leaves let us solve this problem somebody john tell me an equation 10 x 8 equals 80
10 x 8 equals 80 tell me which one is that going to go into
so the bottom left very good it is 10 x 8 does it matter if i do 8 x 10 or 10 x 8 no no it does not okay here it goes 80 somebody tell me another equation
patrick prosper 10 x 20 equals 200 can you tell me what box that is going in top left top left i love it good 20 x 10 equals 200 okay i have 2 more arrays left 2 more arrays calissa huh 2 x 8 and which one is that going in bottom right
bottom right excellent and then i have one more somebody jordan there is one more array and what is 2 x 20 40 we add up our answers 3 okay and we are all set
chris what did you have as an estimate again 300 300 let us see what we get 280 40 +16 is 56 336 our estimate was 300 our actual answer is 336 not bad huh no do we get it yes
okay after lunch our next step is to do it just with our notebook paper and then you can solve your word problems in your groups okay so nice job
and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys yes so they can hear you also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color 13rd 13rd i do not have marker colors to match everything
i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
and the pink pink is what kyla
it is not important really right now just ignore 14th please 14th thank you and i am hearing a lot of talking again deanthony you have not raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything better
who can tell me which color i need to pull out next raise your hand if you can tell me what color is next akasia one 5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th what do we do now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
i am sorry i am going to wait for a 2nd really nicholas all the little noises need to stop that shows me you are not focused at all and it disturbs other people around you they stop yes ophelia
okay but i was thinking ophelia when we did it i think we might have done one 8th next thank you so let us go to one 8th please and one 8th is purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths so purple is one 8th yes ian how wait where was number one why was that one there
i see deshanique talking right now i see malcolm moving yes colby
yeah because it is aqua it is aqua thank you colby for raising your hand okay and white is one 6th everybody get your white ones out one 6th yes nicholas uhh
i do not really remember
yeah so you just i mean .
panther pride so if 0 i forgot to put one thing up there what is one half of one 6th one half of what hand raised please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking nicholas you do not even have it there
what would one half of 16th be one 12th one 12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th and one 12th is what color blue red or is it red actually it was supposed to be brown blue okay
this is one 16th blue is yeah okay so red is one whoa whoa
all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things all eyes up here please all hands empty we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again
we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip so you have another way to really see what you are doing when you are adding and subtracting your fractions and we are also going to use them to model multiplication which we have not really done before
in the past few days or probably a week i have asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply if i am doing 3 times 2 what is another way to describe that problem i am multiplying 3 times 2 what are 2 ways to solve that problem
i can just multiply and i know it is 3 times 2 but what is another way paige adding 3 add so multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add 3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times
so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition to figure out how to multiply those fractions
so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with so let us try one 12th times 3 how could you solve the problem one 12th times 3
one 12th times 3 what does that mean one 12th times 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem i used i used one of these 12s okay and use all my 3s
okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s 3 how many 3s did we need 111 how many 3s did we need 2222 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need how many okay when we do 3 times 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need
3 i need 3 31 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please 31 12 ths akasia please share with kyla or share with colby actually
3 or 21 12 ths what was that 3 or 2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths nicholas okay is it show me please show me please
i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk please do it and especially share with jabari paige has her 31 12 ths malcolm has has 31 12 ths malcolm can you organize those line them up next to each other please deshanique do you have your 31 12 ths put them in front of you on your desk umm okay got it
okay panther pride so one 12th times 3 equals what one 12th times 3 equals what what is it kendall 3 12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right
if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3 if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan thank you thank you
boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths
find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please 3 12 ths show me on your desk is that it show me please line them up next to each other
deanthony you can you please get this here what was your way maybe it is definitely 14th all right
akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths one 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths no 14th 14th 14th show me please i do not see it on your desk i see that you have it out but can you please show me 4 times 3 right here does 14th equals 3 12 ths yes yes it does
14th equals 3 12 ths yes deshanique
umm i would like to find please find how many 16 ths are equal to 14th show me on your desk please how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we know 3 12 ths and 14th are equal
how many 16 ths equal 14th one 16th
calm down okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to we do not really need this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th
4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we just figured out 3 12 ths equals one fouth let us see how many sixteenths equal 14th
please stop whispering malcolm please stop umm not sure you go ahead and press focus right there it is just light it is okay
okay so 14th 0 there it is it is brighter 14th equals okay 14th equals 4 16 ths so what kind of multiplication problem could we write to describe that
14th times something equals 4 16 ths what would our multiplication problem be akasia go ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times 4 fourths is it 4 fourths yes 14th times how many one fourths did we use i am sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault
i wrote that very wrong so 4 16 ths 0 yes hold on here one 16th one 16th times something equals 14th thank you maisie now i do not know you do know one 16th times something sorry maisie
so akasia here is 14th one 16th times all right colby do you know what boys and girls too many of us are not following the rules
i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering this is what it should sound like malcolm akasia go ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes
one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this one times 4 equals 4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths wait until christian comes back please
christian is coming i can not even the number
christian come on quickly okay okay so how about if we added 4 16 ths +14th what fraction would we come up with 4 16 ths +one 4th
4 16 ths +14th you can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator colby and deanthony stop
i am just trying to get your 4 16 ths +14th akasia you got it figured out already
you know it is something on the alphabet on the alphabet yeah what do you mean
umm akasia please get focused
kyla try it please 4 16 ths +one 4th christian did you figure it out is that why you are waving your hand around no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out deanthony do you have it figured out panther pride panther pride
thank you that is better i am glad you are excited but it is way too noisy umm
christian and deshanique will you please come show us how you solve the problem
okay 4 16 ths +14th i will try to help you get it off the camera it is okay everybody has them in front of them anyway go ahead share with your classmates so how we figured this problem out is 12nd let me see if your classmates are listening to you hands are empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk akasia in your chair
deanthony and colby you are listening you are not whispering at all go ahead so how we solved the problem was we put 16th right here and 14th right here did you put 16th right here how many sixths did you put here how many 4 4 16 ths +14th equals one half can you show me please
okay so 4 16 ths +14th equals one half so we have been doing these problems but what have we been doing instead of modeling them adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla add we are still adding but what did we do differently what did we have to do 1st
1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what 4 times 4 equals 6 equals i mean 16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be 4 fourths
4 what right there yep
stand up and walk please all right kyla is going to prove to us malcolm and kendall that 14th +4 16 ths equals what kyla how many 16 ths 88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction one half very good
okay let us prove it okay so one half also equals everybody everybody 8 16 ths thank you
okay because you are playing with that i was they were not it does not matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary i need all eyes up here eyes jabari if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can
it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions we only really did one example that just reminded me okay have a seat please kyla thank you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be one 16th times 3
please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3 kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it colby is about to try
good kendall is working it out i got it kendall has got it i got it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try and go put those cushions back in the classroom library thank you take ian is too maisie has got it akasia has got it
nicholas has it 0 i did it panther pride ophelia i still see you talking akasia one 16th times 3 equals one 6th
one 16th times 3 where are you showing me on your desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 3 16 ths may i have panther pride
ian thank you i see that you are quiet christian put that away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 0 well the 1st way i knew is because we did it before and did we do it before yeah we did we did
and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one okay one times 3 equals 33 and then
thank you deshanique thank you ian thank you kendall and nicholas and malcolm okay 16 times one is 16 now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that you place it down thank you akasia kyla i need you paying attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please why did i put the one down here
what does 3 over one mean or 31st what does that mean ophelia well a girl means that i know why but it was the it was done because because if you multiply 16 by 3 it would not make any sense because then you would have 3 something something and not really ready to do that math
but but the denominator would have to stay the same but if you multiplied it by anything but one it would not be the same okay let us think too though about what 3 divided by one means remember that fractions also represent division problems so 3 divided by one equals what 333 divided by one equals 3
so if i write 3 in my numerator and one in my denominator i am really still just writing the number 3 but i can see that when i multiply or add one 16th 3 times i have 3 16 ths kyla turn around please get focused again one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
let us try a different one seeing as i would already done that problem how about 14th times 314 times 3 show me please show me show me show me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip i do not have a 3rd so i can not show you 14th times 3
it is easy 14th times 3 deshanique has it paige has it malcolm has not done it yet show me please you show me what 14th times 3 looks like
did any fall 3 fourths that is important jabari please show me 14th times 3
once you show me is this 3 fourths right here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths what is this
panther pride thank you for your patience one 4th times 3 so jabari what did we figure out 14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction thank you one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay
umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions deshanique you want one more yeah i want one you know this already though do not you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right me too how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore
2 sixths times 4 give it a try 2 sixths times 4 how would we do that work it out please in front of you 2 sixths times 4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers show me what is the problem no show me 2 sixths times 4
turn around show me jabari show me 2 sixths times 4 there are not any how can you make 2 thirds and you might have to participate with somebody next to you also okay
it is not 8 12 ths ian you are going to have to cooperate with these 2 we need to share because 2 sixths times 4 did you make a substitution or
thank you ian thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
paige it is their turn to share get ready to listen please
deshanique we should be quiet and listening to our classmates akasia listening please boys and girls i am listening for silence right now maisie lift your head up
kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening jabari i see you pretty ready justin is ready that equals 2 let me see if i can help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please
your classmates are not ready deshanique ophelia we are listening malcolm you must listen to each other akasia have a seat kyla put both of your feet on the floor and listen
how did you get those 8 sixths though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening getting better put that down
put your hands down and pay attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place how did you decide you needed that many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please
what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari 2 how many did we need what was our original problem i do not know if you can see it over here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please what was our original problem jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down what 2 6 ths times 4
okay 2 sixths times 4 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then 2 sixths times 4 equals 26 times right here nicholas 26 times 4 equals is what 8 6 ths
okay do you see that akasia 1234567 okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction
okay okay so one and 2 sixths once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed mixed number they had one and 2 sixths so jabari how many sixths does it take to make 11
how many sixths does it take to make one how many sixths does it take to make one jabari jabari what does the denominator tell us what does the denominator of a number tell us colby
the number tells you like like like how much it is in the whole how many what in the whole what do you mean by how much how much whatever you are how many parts 0 parts equal parts how many equal parts so jabari how many equal parts do you need to make a whole if each part is 16th
jabari you need 6 sixths to make one whole 6 sixths equals one right okay you guys are going to try some of these on your own yes you may now
can i go to the bathroom what was that what was the question kendall
are we allowed to do our work under this yeah of course
please stop chitter chatting
yep looks good i need my bag you do not need your bag
is this wrong miss is this wrong
what would 3 thirds be if you have 3 parts 3 parts altogether you have 3 parts of the 3 altogether
okay so not right now you could do that you can work it up that way or you can work it up with a strip
okay 2 4 ths
panther pride panther pride one of your classmates has a request for some silent time and i do not disagree spend the next few minutes working without talking you are facing your own paper kyla akasia already yes leila umm
akasia please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit what was that yep
nicholas keep the congratulations inside your head for a few minutes so it is okay that is not a big deal
kendall they are here i am sorry nicholas wow we did not even last for one minute paige it is silent time right now
boys and girls kyla
you are sitting there doing nothing
are we getting our work done no
thank you thank you very much this is turned on too right okay alright got everybody seated is everybody in a place where they can see where they can participate boys can you see there okay we need to do calendar for 2 days we did not do it yesterday so we are going to add 2 days starting with to our number line yesterday was the 100 and ninth day of school and today is the 110th day of school
how many days until the end of the school year
can you write a fraction 1st of all representing .
the 1st thing you are going to do is write a fraction showing how many days we have been in school so far and we are going to spend just about 10 minutes doing calendar we may not get to everything show me the fraction that tells us how many days we have been in school so far well that is just exciting huh but no snow days yet can you reduce that
what is one clue that you can reduce that they are both even they are both even so you know they are going to be divisible by 2 while we are doing this do any of our numbers need part
110 do you need to circle 110 yes i do need to circle 110 think if we can reduce more look and see yes i need to circle 110 how many more circles will i have before the end of this school year 7 more kay do either of them get a triangle no square no star yes
kay
that was a good try hexagon no day of the week chart
no no octagon
9 dice
okay so that is it so a 109 did not get anything 110 had 2 factors alright was anybody i think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms look around show your elbow partner what your answer was i see a lot of equivalent fractions what would you guys get i i i i .
what was the reduce one what was the lowest you could go 11 over 1811 over 18 that was pretty interesting could you show me the fraction of the days we still ha so we could say we have had 11 eighteenths of our school year already that is pretty what fraction tells us how much to go how many more days to go 80 more right no fraction show me in a fraction we have already said there is 70 days and if it has zeroes what can you do reduce it
reduce it and they are both divisi and do you remember i see a lot of 35 over 90 so what i want you to do is to look both at 35 and at nintey see if it can be see if they have any factors in common
7 eighteenths left in the school year that is what i got too 7 eighteenths and 11 eigteenths those were the 2 numbers could you compare them using a less than greater than or equal to symbol compare the fraction that is showing the days we have already done the days we have left m kay good deal
alright let us take a look at a couple new things i want to show you the 1st thing i want us to do is we are going to add we are going to talk about our decimal we now have a mixed number do not we so i am going to color 2 days and i wonder if you see a couple different ways that we could write it we can create an equivalent decimal look at what i am doing
i have colored a full 10 colored another 10 show me a couple different ways to represent this number what about using a decimal point good here is one way who has a different way colby has 2 ways we have got one and 10 hundredths we also have one one which is one and 110th i see some fractions good job
okay can you show me the percent what would the percent be what would the percent be
a 110% if somebody tells you that you give a 110% that is what it would look like if you were drawing a picture even though it does not go that high it is supposed to be a 100% right
right okay let us take a look at our february calendar trying to think what was in here and i have some new pictures when is my next birthday in february huh
0 the 30 and 31 from january i still have up there alright who is our next birthday
eunice when is your birthday monday 4th is saturday right okay so we will sing tomorrow but let us take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month you are going to like these there is a couple different patterns going on let me show you the one for the 1st we are going to do it for yesterday and for today
it will take a while to see the pattern will not it and what we will do is we will do it for the weekend and for monday okay this is our 1st one take a look at you should be looking at my picture right now okay we are going to put this down because i want you to look at my picture who can describe this can you see it
okay so we have got a cube turn to your elbow partner and tell them something about a cube what do you notice is under the number one
do we know what that means yet valentine is day it is a smile and a heart maybe it is part of the pattern it is it is going to be related to the pattern but we have not seen enough yet joey what did you tell your par your partner about a cube
listen up 0 boxes can be shaped like a cube what else can boxes be shaped like look at me joey okay not at them what else what else can what other shape can boxes be made into think of a cereal box a rectangle rectangular prism what else
okay straight lines in straight lines in them or curved lines
tell me what this picture is this is the one for today gary your eyes should be up here this is a rectangular prism tell me tell me how it is different well 1st of all how are they the same how are rectangular prisms and cubes the same tell me one way i like how matthew has his hand raised quadrilateral huh quadrilateral well they are not quadrilaterals but they are faces maybe because remember they are 3 dimensional so how many faces are there
6 think of a dice or a box how many sides are there
okay so those faces the 2 dimensional ones would be quadrilaterals what else what else luke they have the same number of edges they have the same number of edges what else do they have the same number of corners corners m kay who sees something else they have the same number of vertices vertices which is another word for what bottom nobody should be writing anything right now your eyes should be looking at those 2 pictures
girls your eyes should be looking at my 2 pictures vertices is the same thing as points points corners also they have the same number of faces which are going to be your flat surfaces alright do we have enough really to be able to talk about what our pattern is going to be
yeah we do not really have enough pictures to see what could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month audrey each heart could be an odd number but tell me what you think the picture is going to be 3 dimensional 3 dimensional shapes or solids alright the next thing we are going to do is we are going to play a game i know you guys were disappointed that number crunch went away for a little bit we are going to play a probability game the name of this game is going to be 120 spins
and what we are going to do is i have 2 spinners up here and every day we are going to take the spinner going to let a girl spin it 6 times a boy spin it 6 times and then we are going to talk we are going to graph the results up here in a tally chart who has a prediction about what the what the results are going to be or anything related to this experiment what do you think luke take a couple of predictions
yellow will mostly likely get the most tallies okay yellow let me put this back up here so that you can see nobody should be writing anything at this point if i see you with your whiteboard i will think that you are not with me okay so put it a place where you can see charlie we are going to wait for you so that you can look up here luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most tallies okay
and i am just going to do a few predictions today because i want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of of february yellow most likely put a thumb up if you agree with that most likely will have the most going to need someone to help me with this okay who has another prediction josh
since you just jinxed it i think red will i think red will be the be the best since once you spin it and you probably spin it at the red or the blue it will probably go around and and stop on where the red is well and let me just stop you for just a minute hey luke why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most cause it has 2 squares yeah let us take a look at this folks i want you to look at at what my spinner looks like
how can we describe my spinner by the way what could we say the yellow part is 2 fourths yeah we could say that 2 fourths of it is shaded do have an equal amount of shading like is it 3 equal colors no no okay so we could say one half or 2 fourths are shaded yellow red is 14th blue is 14th so do you see where luke may have gotten that prediction in a spinner game he thinks that more than likely will land quite a bit there
but josh says red will have the most because you guys just jinxed it what do y what does that even mean
jinx bad luck it means it probably do the exact opposite of what you think you think well maybe you jinxed it and it is going to be blue 0 my goodness everybody is jinxing it blue is going to have the most
okay make your predictions based on what you know about math and spinner games m kay we probably need to be thinking that way not necessarily jinxing and stuff like that blue will have the most i am going to take one more i want a lady this time
okay i am going to write today is date too madison i think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins 0 good prediction
madison said okay i said i was only going to take one more so put your hands down we got to move on blue plus red will equal what
yellow okay let me find someone who has been on task i am going to pick a girl and a boy alright and do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner yes alright so what i am going to do put your hand down please i am going to take it to a hard surface can i see someone does anyone have a pencil closeby charlie can you grab a pencil from your desk thank you bud alright what you are going to do is you are going to take it to a flat surface just one of the areas close by
you take the pencil point you put the spinner put it or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner boom now you got to move your hand out of the way and what you are going to do is you are go we are going to count you will let me know how many yellows you had how many reds and how many blues okay alright let us see .
you do your 6 maybe those boys can help you count and i think i am going to let laura do this spinner okay alright so watch watch whoever is closest to you watch whoever is closest to you you need you want to borrow charlie is pencil here you g 0 goodness i almost got you you guys remember how to make tallies 1234 and then you strike across
brandon if you need to go and do the blinds he got yellow yellow sit down sit down brandon you can go get it out of your eyes go do the blinds okay what would you get boys
tell me what you got kiddo 4 yellows one red one blue 4 yellows okay let us look at what he got 4 yellows 1234 let me get someone else to help me jasmine you are going to help me tally what else was it one one red red and one blue okay laura is spinner what was yours 3 yellows okay so you are going to go strike across
232 reds 2 reds and one blue and one blue alright so let us take a look right now we have 56789101112 we have done 12 spins 0 actually i think we were only supposed to do 20 to do 6 a day 0 well that is okay we will do it for monday we got excited alright so we have 567 yellows 2 blues and 3 reds
is that about what we said might happen whose prediction is that close to
0 that is right that is why i did it twice okay thank you
3 wait no no never mind
it was close is it close 3 +2 is 5 i was going to say that okay i was going to say that red and blue for he predictions i was going to say that red and blue have the same amount red and blue will have the same amount the same amount as the at the end yes okay we are going to stop here there is one more game that i want to teach you but we need to move on to what we are going to do in math today there is going to be another game where we are adding ounces each day ooh m kay so we will catch up tomorrow
if we add an ounce a day about how many ounces will we have tomorrow we will have about 3 we will have 3 ounces tomorrow okay so we will talk a little bit about that can i have my spinners please and when you back to your seats you are going to hold on to your whiteboards hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute i am going to see if you can kind of help me out on the number line and then we will put them away when we go to our partner game okay as you go back i need you to try not to bump the camera so you might want to go around that way
miss eunice can you throw this away for me thank you whoops thank you mister for letting me borrow that sweetie i am going to slide behind you thank you alright get to a place where you can see please we are going to spend a couple minutes here together
then we are going to play a partner game that i think i might pick the partners we will have to think about that for just a minute do we have everybody here today from both classes right we have nobody out okay so we have all 25 that means we will have to have one group of 3 jose is out okay so we do have an even group alright 1st think i do is i have i want to show you my 2 number lines i am actually going to put a 3rd one up there but we were kind of running out of room take a look at the 1st number line the one up top how is it spaced
by ones yes we have it kind of going by ones alright what we are going to do is we are going to take a look at a decimal number and think about where it would go on 3 different number lines so looking at the 1st number line i want you to draw you could just draw a segment but i want you to show me where do you think you would put this number between which 2 numbers on my number line 1st of all .
let me erase this real quick okay read that top number for me 3 and 73 hundredths 3.733 and 73 hundredths looking at we will call this why do not we just call this line number one looking at num line number one where would you put that number show me you do not have to draw the whole number line if you just want to kinda put the number that would be come before maybe draw the segment you do not have to draw 0 to 10
what 2 numbers would that come between 3 and 4 and who thinks they can come and show me where it would come so josiah will you do that for me come and show me where it would come what we are going to work on today is refining the ability to compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line do you want me to just put a dot or just put a dot put an arrow just kind of put it above it okay who agrees with that is that where you had yours
yes question if we were going to round this number look at what it is closest to what would it round to
it would round to 4 and i was telling my my science class that i will not be here on monday because of jury duty but this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is you will be thinking about rounding so i think it is kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today i know we have already kind of covered that a little bit but 3.73 is closer to 4 do you see that in my number line which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer is not it
alright now what i am going to do is i am going to erase this guy for just a minute and i am going to erase these numbers cause we are going to use this look at the 2nd number line we will call it number line 2 what is different about the 1st one that we just looked at david it was going by ones and this one is going by 5s okay so this one is kind of going by halves
that is why my last number is a what
it is a 5 alright so i want you to show me where would this number fall on this number line between which 2 numbers because now you are not just looking at the whole number you are having to look at parts of the decimal as well so show me what 2 numbers it would come in between
on this number line where would it fall on this one so now you are having to compare .73 with another number she put it between 3.5 and 4 who agrees with that alright we are going to actually make a different number line watch this one you ready i am going back up to the 1st one
you know what i might do is kind of stagger it i think that helped a little bit better look at this a little bit better what is different about this number line
yeah it is starting what is our f 0 you know what i forgot to put my last point alright so what are my 2 whole numbers that it is between
kay so these are numbers in between 3 and 4 show me on your whiteboard where you think 3 and 73 hundredths would fall josh why would you pick that because 3.7 and then you just need to go up 3 more and then you have it 3 what more 3 more tenths would that be tenths
hundredths yeah did you hear what josh said he says he kn he knew it was going to be bigger than 3.7 so he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this and i knew it was going to be less than 3.8 and he knew it was going to be less than this so that kind of narrowed it where that would fall in what did he have to look at did you hear what he said he said in this case he had to look at the hundredths place if i wanted to round 3.73 boy we could just play with this number all day could not we huh
you want to write it in word form
okay i will not do that yes 3.73 if i wanted to round this to the nearest whole number remember your whole number is the number to the left of the decimal show me what you would have we are just going to do a couple more things with this number the closest whole number
wait the closest whole number that means you are going to have .00.00 you are rounding it to the nearest whole number which is going to be this guy right here so is it going to be closer let us take a look at it is it closer to 3 point 3 or 44 what is it closest to if it is right here 4 okay can you round it to the closest 10th yes
is it closer to 3.7 or 3.8 where would it fall 3.7 it would be the same thing as 3.7 i mean 3.70 well it would not be the same thing but it would round well right it would round to 3.7 okay and could you round it to the closest 100th what would that look like that that that would not really make any difference it would still be 3.73.70
alright we are going to play a partner game kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day where we were using the decimal cards and you were and you were putting them in order
alright another fun partner game and let me show you how it works today you are going to have a recording sheet and you are going to have some more opportunities to compare numbers and to use your great than less than and equal to symbols kay goodness we have already been in class about 30 minutes alright what we are going to do is i am going to pass this around this is your recording sheet have we picked your partners yet no no not we have not picked partners yet
still should not see people playing on their whiteboards want to help me pass it out buddy
i had to get you one that was more challenging to be able to play pass it ou 0 i took em all that did not help i guess you can not pass that out
yes yes baby can we put up our whiteboards wait hold on and we will do the whiteboards when we are going to get partners and and in our re transitioning okay the 1st thing that you are going to do is i want you to take a look at your recording sheet you are going to play 5 rounds david can you slide up sweetie you are going to play 5 rounds of this game
and i want you to be thinking is this game going to be more luck or strategy when i luck well i had not told you the directions yet so listen for the directions the 1st thing you are going to do charlie can you come grab miss name a dice and it can be any any of the numbers it can be the one through 6
hm i forgot to get forgot to grab one for yourself where is the extra papers
huh
okay pass them to me okay extra extra read all about it thank you ben
extra extra those papers
okay does everybody have a recording sheet
alright no will you 0 my goodness my helpers you did not think to make things more efficient necessarily i make it more okay does everybody have a recording sheet for this game yes okay good deal alright listen up for just a moment the 1st thing you are going to do is you are going to roll the dice you and your partner
i roll a 2 i want you to roll it had not told you what to do ye with this yet okay i roll i got a 3 she got a 3 so let us do this you want to play class against miss courson for a couple of rounds yes alright sh you all got a 3 i got a 2 so who got less you right i have less so what i am going to do is how many circles are on my recording sheet
there are 5 all the way down my paper i am going to go less than less than less than all the way down alright so greater than y do not do it yet flip it over on the back yes go ahead and you guys put greater than 5 times 5 times greater than greater than greater than greater than huh 4 times i ran out of board here whoops
okay
so we do not do that we do not do that right here
she is the reason i am having you do this on the back is because i want you to use the front you are going to get with a partner in a minute and play this yeah right now i am just demonstrating the game and you are going to you are going to be one person and i am going to be the other person you all are going to try to beat me m kay alright so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who is going to go 1st rock paper scissors
okay i got 3 she got 3 are we going to do the highest number wins or the lowest number wins by the way who gets to go 1st i do not know highest number okay that works alright i got a 6 i am going to go 1st just simply because i got to teach you the game anyway right yes madam so this is what huh did you cheat watch alright let us listen
go ahead and write this all the way down your paper as well
yes because it is going to look like your recording sheet but it says 416 0 is it i am sorry i was thinking it was all yes okay just do just do the 1st one then just do the 2s
that would be hilarious but i did not the eraser dropped onto the ground 0 we will be okay okay you ready what we are going to do is we are going to go 1st we are going to go left to right my paper all has less thans you guys all have greater thans now it really does not matter who rolls the dice 1st just whoever you star with you need to stick with i am going to roll the dice 1st
and i am going to roll it 2 times alright i got a 2 and watch what i am doing when i roll the dice i am putting it in the order 00 that i roll it okay so a strategy game would be i would have to maybe decide where to put it
so this is more of a luck game knew it i told you okay alright now roll the other 2 okay class 6 yes do not say yes yet i got a 4 and a 4 okay this is how this games works is that number sentence true yes read it for me
0 and by the way you all should have been you guys should have been putting in those numbers too do that
0 just do it anyway let us watch what is going to happen what whose paper is this a true sentence on yours so guess who gets the point you aw okay so watch what we are going to do miss courson gets the point because that made an accurate and true number sentence 2 and 26 hundredths is less that is why you all were like yeah and i was like 0 no see i knew i would beat you already and 2 and 64
we are going to play okay listen
yes yes okay
what does the next one say watch now listen though shh if did you guys win that point or did i you okay but listen i do want you to write it the correct way cause practicing things incorrectly will help nobody so i want you to and if you take your paper home and your mom is like did your teacher tell you that was right it would be difficult to explain so i want you somewhere on your paper to write it the correct way
that works too m kay i want you to correct that okay alright the next one looks like this
actually will you pass it to a friend okay pass it to a boy okay so this is round 2 do you see what i mean by this is luck
cause if it was a strategy game i would be trying to make decisions about what place to put them in okay you ready garett we are going left to right 4 times okay 50 that is going to be challenging 44 okay so we need 011 what oops 22 yay we got a point is that a correct state or number sentence
no 4 and 54 hundredths is less than so who won that point
the greater than yes do not forget to correct it on your paper wait it is already correct on our paper 0 that is right i need to correct it duh okay so we get a point okay you got a point i got a point
okay next it is one alright
is it one okay so round 3 this is fun is not this a luck game it is a luck game it just depends 0
i am always number 13 i am sorry it is superstitious but i am always number 13 question can you kind of make predictions about who is going to get the point after the 1st couple of numbers rolled yeah cause you know the likelihood of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than you want a turn baby or you have a question i guess i want a turn okay you know what though i think i get to go fir i think actually it was my turn and then i will to you kay alright real easy to set up too
could you play this at home
instead of playing video games
yeah that is instead of playing video games but i do not get time to play video games anymore well i can not i am not allowed to play on weekend on weekdays but on weekends
okay who won that point
alright and what i want to show you is for friends who might need who may not if it is really close and you are not sure what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it if you need to have that picture so on your whiteboard listen to what i am sayin put your hand down for just a moment on your whiteboard i want you to draw a picture of that number sentence use your flats your longs and your units what would that look like here i will draw it on here
put your put your hand down you should be drawing on your whiteboard right now 0 on the whiteboard we are supposed to draw the 3rd one what i am demonstrating right now is i am showing how if you needed more support and if you were not sure especially if you had something like one.20 and one.02 i do not get this at all i do
watch me we have done this before
if you need to draw a picture if you were not sure do you have to do that no no i would not draw elaborate pictures draw your whole numbers your tenths and your hundredths okay we have been using these blocks all throughout our decimals unit and on the calendar this is the picture that matches if you do not need that do you have to do that no no
what i was recommending this for was if you got something like this and if it was tricky and if you needed the picture okay it would help with maybe something like this would that be less than or greater than
one.12 would be less than okay alright we are going to spend about 10 to 15 minutes playing this game yes buddy what if they are equal well if they are 0 if they are equal hm you would have to probably redo it or a tie breaker or a tie breaker you could do that too maybe you just want to decide before you start the game
okay when you go with your partner you are going to put your whiteboards away for me friends we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back okay so you got to make sure you get up the things you need to get up you could take this page home i am going to put a prompt on the board i am going to have you write in your math notebook and then we are going to share at the very end of class after this game i think i will let you pick your own partners
just do not bump the camera
honey is this your science experiment josh innappropriate
does everybody have a partner no kay i would like for ryan who are you working with you got to get started who are you working with
who were you working with okay joey is working with david and brandon are going to work together garett you all need to get started okay
yes
have you started working yet no okay let us go come on who are you with joey or brandon joey who is your partner okay get started how we doin ladies who is the less than person
wait a minute woah stop stop stop what di remember what did you roll did you roll .
okay we got to stop let us erase that hold on just a minute do not forget what is the 1st step of this game
boys boys the 1st step is you have to roll the dice and decide who writes the less than symbol all the way down their paper and then that does not change and who writes the greater than down their paper and that does not change m kay do that 1st figure out who is less than and greater than
okay so let us do that real quick roll the dice you only needed one dice ladies so which one are y okay that is fine okay so laura you are less than all the way down
okay now you are ready to start playing who is going to go 1st
laura is going to go 1st alright laura roll the dice so your 1st number you have got to do 4 numbers your 1st one is a 2 yours too alright and laura roll it again you are going to do the whole 1st .4 let us look at that okay so 2.24 is going to be less than something
2.24 is going to be greater than something that is going to be tricky who do you think is more than likely going to get this point based on the 1st 2 numbers
what would laura have to roll next
anything higher than a 2.25 or whatever alright let us see what she got
and 4 alright look at your number whose is correct laura is is because hers is actually less than 2 and 44 hundredths so who gets that and i do not care where you guys try to write it somewhere on the paper so that means hers it correct yours is not what are you going to have to do to make that right
yeah make sure you fix it or momma will think i am teaching you all the wrong things okay here we go okay 0 i like that a tally chart that works okay who is my greater than and and less than boys i am greater than okay and you are less than all the way down okay whose turn is it to roll the dice
okay you got to do all 4 of em all 4 of em going across did you write your 5 he is on the 2nd one he is on the 2nd point so you should have written a 5
okay and you have to copy the same thing
no no he is still rolling that whole point
okay is that how you all are playing it where you are both doing it .
you can we are going to do the prompt on the board in just a minute in our math notebook you went really fast huh you want to play a couple more points you can play a couple more points so is this my number he is going to finish rolling all the way across
keep going you are going to roll the next 2 you all are going to have the same numbers going across it is just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence the other one will not be write a 2
okay woah woah woah i did not see a one i just saw a 2
okay we did not see that so just make that number a 2
okay and a but i see a 4 so where would you get 3 from
okay okay and you got to write your 3 too okay so now look this is what these are the 4 numbers you have got in this turn which one is correct who got that point who got that point
so what do you have to do if he got that point that means yours is not right you have to correct it okay cause you can not go home with the wrong stuff on your paper right okay and now he will do the next 4 rolls for the 3rd point
0 you all did a championship round
boys and girls some of you guys are finishing a little bit quickly if you want to do a couple more rounds that is fine we do need to be wrapping it up in the next 5 minutes you have a math notebook prompt on the board so you need to go to your next available page what is wrong bud
0 who is doing okay so who is rolling for the 4th round did you all just get a tie score you all both got one.14 and one.14 no m kay let us do number 3 then i am going let me help you are not you glad i am here here grab the dice okay
okay hold on you got to erase it all the way across
i am going to let her do it though just cause you helped me before okay okay woah woah woah where would that 6 come from did you know that did you see that 6 okay did you write down the 1st 6 but which side do i write it on you are going to write it yours is going to look exactly like hers okay roll it again
m kay roll the next 2 numbers you roll it all the way across it is still your turn
and a one okay so she rolled a 6311 and one of these is correct the other one is not
why was hers correct
one and 63 hundredths is more than greater than one yeah so what you are going to do and now you will roll the next 4 numbers boom boom boom boom okay do not forget if yours was incorrect you have got to fix it on your paper so you do not take home the wrong information yes madam
yes who is your partner fatima fatima is okay alright boys and girls as you come to a stopping point hey you all boys and girls eyes on me please boys friends on the floor aria which number is larger this is your prompt on the board
3.7 or 3.653 point explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words you are going to do a quick write we are going to share these in about 8 minutes so a quick write means you are sitting down you are getting it done you may take this game home hurry put my clipboards away please
put my dice away luke why do not you walk around and be the helper okay today is the 2nd it is february 2nd
madison do you mind walking around pushing in chairs so we will be ready after lunch colby walk on make sure we have all the dice put back in the container
madison is already started luke were you pushing in chairs for me sweetie
over here i am also going to pass out your homework for tonight it is a review of what we have done it is a review of equivalent decimals
want to help me pass these out sweetie quick write i already see eunice she has her math notebook out which number is larger 3.7 or 3.65 explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words and also symbols
and i will write your homework on the board will you p pass this down to brandon and audrey please the game sheet that you guys had today you could take that home with you charlie you should be in your seat now and i think someone might be missing their math notebook because it has been up here on the table
i think that is that is colby is i think it is
not sure what that other notebook is but keep it in your math notebook does everybody have a homework for tonight miss courson i do not get it which number is larger 3 and 7 tenths or 3 and 65 hundredths explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words got about 4 more minutes keep writing
pw i put ps nintey 6 because you see they have named it differently this comes from a problem solving book yeah that is why it says ps 96 not pw normally we put pw 960 it says ps on here too it says ps on the paper that is why i just did not want to confuse you by putting pw
homework yes i like how i see kashish writ drawing some pictures maybe similar to what we did back before the game keep writing or write in your agenda book who has one to share even if it is just part madison
the way i know 3.7 is greater than 3.65 is because if you added 0 to 770 is greater than 65 yes that is correct who else has one audrey 3.7 is farther on the number line so it is larger it is farther on the number line if we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class it would be down a tad would not it jasmine
okay david .
keep working because it is far it is farther in the lumber in the number line and it is also no it is larger it the 7 is maybe 700 yeah look at he looked at his tenths place did you hear what he just said he compared the tenths place and he knew that 7 was greater than what 6 yeah brandon what would you get
3 and 7 tenths is larger than 3 and 65 hundredths i know this because 10 times 10 is 100 so 7 times 10 is 70 and 70 is greater than 65 okay josh i think 3 3.7 is bigger becau because it is the same thing as 3 3.70 okay
it is correct it is correct just different ways of saying 3 and 7th tenths is just another way of saying 3 and 70 hundredths that is why i think 3 and 7 tenths is greater than 3 and 65 hundredths did anyone draw a picture hole up if you drew pictures using x is or a 100s chart or dots that is kind of a lot you would have had to draw like 710s or 7 yeah
