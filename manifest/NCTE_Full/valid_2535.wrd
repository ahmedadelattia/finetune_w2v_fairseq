okay class today we are going to talk about volume and when we talk about volume we have to think about 3 dimensions the length the height and the width okay
so we know for a fact that volume is equal to what who can tell me alan length width height length times width times height height 3 dimensions okay
the 1st thing that i will do is find out any point right here in my grid to start so that is the how do you call the start point of any start point let us call the start point okay so i am going to use this one right here so i am going to start right here
so the length is how much or how many units 66 units so i am going to count 123456
this is the length 6 the width because remember that we are using 3 dimensions so our box is going to be 3 dimensional
so everything is going to be here so it is going to be 123455 so i have the 3 dimensions in my face of 6 units by 4 units by 5 units so the length the width and the height
so i am going to make my box how i am going to make my box i am going to plot the same thing but in the same direction okay so let us think about the length the length in this line is going to be how many units diego 6
6 units 123456 that is my length okay and this one will be just connected right here so i have one face of my box
now we already did the length let us do the width let us continue with the width starting right here you are going to count 1234 because the width is equal 4
can you visualize that the box is coming yeah okay so that should be connected right here right so we have the front we have the bottom now let us go to the sides from here how many units i have to count to put the height jaime
55123455 and what about from here james or jaime the height how many 5 units
12345 okay i need another height and it is right here
so i just have to connect my corners what is another word for corner do you remember vertices vertices when it is more than one when it is only one vertex vertex okay i am going to connect this and i am going to connect this can you visualize the box
yes okay now let us make sure that our dimensions is the same everywhere 6 length 4 width 5 height what dimension is that one what dimension is juliana 5 what dimension is it is a length height it is a height and height is
5 let us count 12345 so this is 5 what dimension is that one daniel 4 what dimension is that 18 who can help daniel carlos
the width the width and the width is 12344 daniel again what dimension is that one length length and the length is 61234566
now this dimension is what dimension luther length length height height the one that i am tracing right now ceci length length and length is how many units 66 units so everywhere you go what about this one
what dimension is that one cutting height height and height is 55 units so everywhere you go our box is it has the same dimensions
but before that if we have to apply that formula to find the volume of this box what we should what are we suppose to do
so let us say volume of this box right here and we are going to say that this box is a and the one that you are going to make is b okay so for box number a what is the volume alan 6 x 4 x 5
okay volume will be 6 times 4 times 55 and how much is that only one person how much is that luis 120 120 how did you figure it out luis
i did 6 x 4 equals 24 and i did 24 x 5 equals 120 120 so the volume is 120 so let us work on this 14 units by 9 units by 11 units
and just follow the steps that i did in this building this box foreign language okay foreign language i am going to ask some questions about it so you need to figure out if you are going to use the paper and landscape show me the landscape
wait yes show show to the whole class what landscape means okay what portrait means like that so you have to decide in what way you are going to do that you need to use your ruler you to connect the points mister matta use mister matta do not use any ruler but you have to use it
you have to look for that point in this plane or grid plot it and then connect those points and make the box yes can we use colors you are going to use color at the end
kevin used a ruler okay kevin do you have a ruler with this you have a ruler foreign language okay
what way are you going to use landscape or portrait landscape you need to use pencil
so i am going to ask the whole class again in this box if you look at the box how many faces in this box how many faces 66
can you go over there and count it for me so the whole class will see how many faces or sides you see in the box so let us take a look at it 123456 and 6 in the back okay
thank you diego and remember at the end that you need to label label your box you see the numbers that i put right here yes
so tell me how do you start this you are using the portrait so i am going to look like this okay tell me what was the 1st step you did the length the length and how many units on the length 1414 okay so you need to label that right now
you just put 14 length is equal 14 and this is what width the width so you put w and the value of the width which is 999 units
and the height 1111 so height is 11 now you have the front part and the bottom part of the box
now luis can you tell me how what are you doing right here i am doing the length 1st then i am doing the width and then the height so you need to label any unit that you count there with a little period there label means also showing me this okay
for every unit that you count so for length is 14 yes now bryan what faces of the box do you have already here
i already did the front i am still working on i am trying to do the top of the the top so you only need to connect those 2 right here and you will have the top part huh and so you need the bottom part and the back part of the box
huh whoever finishes 1st i want the person to go and plot those on the board and tell the class the steps that you followed to plot those points on the grid and what did you find 1st 2nd and 3rd
sometimes we use strategies to beginning with the bottom or the top or the front
almost done carlos okay i think you got it carlos are you making sure that what dimension is that one the width the width okay and the width is how many units 99 how many units do you have there you have to count the points
99 okay so i see that carlos is done with the length width and height carlos you want to go over there and plot those points on the grid yes okay
let me see if i have enough sometimes okay
i am going to trace a little line between because we are not going to have enough when we are going to put it here
so i am going to try to be right in the middle like this to have enough we are assuming that this is even okay
did anybody find out already the volume of the box anybody find out no okay
almost okay
try to be as much as i can very accurate okay is that the volume okay now class carlos is going to explain carlos you can use the purple one which is dark
is that the volume yes we are not going to do now the volume that is going to be at the end let us plot let us find out your box right here so i am going to give you the maybe the point is going to be maybe right here so you do it for the whole class
you doing the length so that is going to be the length you can just trace it huh exactly and make a big one right here too okay now that is the length how many units is the length
1414 right 14234567899 units good for you okay and the height is
1111 width is 9 the height is 11 okay carlos right there i can give you a hand on that
okay for the height carlos our box is going to be more than that it is going to be huge up there so we are not going to have a space for that okay so i am going to help you to finish this right here and so one just try to do the .
as much as you can carlos okay it is right there okay so try to connect it like that okay
good for you carlos so the height is 11 units
carlos we cannot go more because we are not going to have a space for that so we have the front and the bottom of our box
thank you carlos now who can tell me what is the volume of that what is the volume the volume is so to get the volume we just have to multiply 14 x 9 x 11
how much is that bryan landaverde 13861386 who is agreeing with that okay how did you figure it out sir
how did you figure it out how much is 14 times 9 how much is 14 times 45360 so 360 times 11 is that okay
so let us find out 14 times 9 you say it is how much 3630660 it cannot be 4 times 9 how much is 4 times 9 luis 36
36 and one times 99 is 9 +31212 so 14 times 9 is a 126 and then you multiply 126 times what 1111 and that would be 6 .
821621 it is going to be 6831 so you have the same thing okay
1386 that means that means that with those 3 dimensions that box can carry 1386
does anybody has any questions okay
