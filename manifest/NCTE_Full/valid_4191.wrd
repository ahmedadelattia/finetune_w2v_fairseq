anything else on your desk you need to take it off so it is not in the way water bottles put them on the floor put them on the floor caleb please come sit here come sit here 0 my god maddie why do not you sit here okay we are going to practice modeling multiplying and dividing decimals by another decimal
so i am going to give you graph paper you do not need it quite yet just kind of put it to the side you will fill in in a minute take out some colored pencils also i forgot to tell you to do that i would rather you not do markers crayons or colored pencils are good okay just put them on the back counter for right now
we will give it back when he comes in here okay okay where is my little clicker
all right so on your math journal write how do you model a multiplication of a decimal by another decimal that is your essential question how do you model .
everybody needs to have their question down question is on the board ryan you are putting in front of how do you model multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
okay you should be close to being done so that i can switch the screen okay pencils are down when you are done so i know i can move on
okay tell me how multiplying a decimal by a decimal will be similar to money what can you tell me caleb because money is a decimal or a fraction of a dollar okay because quarters or are those dimes these are dimes so how would i .
a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths okay so a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths which is ¢10 right yes okay okay so how would my what would my multiplication problem look like to show this answer
what would i write a 10th times a 10th because i have how many dimes 1010 so what is my answer one whole one whole which is a dollar okay good alright look at this one how would i write write the multiplication problem for this on your paper
what would it look like to model a decimal using money
okay okay what is my number of cents going to be shane 110th times 5 times 5 which is going to equal what ¢50 ¢50
4 times decimals it is 50 what 100s good okay do this one show that number of cents with quarters those are quarters caleb now is not the time
okay make sure you have a number of cents i just do not want to see the answer i want to see the number of cents
so what is my number of cents ryan 25 hundredths . huh 5 good 25 hundredths times 3 equals 75 hundredths 75 hundredths okay now we are going to look at a decimal by a decimal
so i want you on the graph paper that i gave you i want you to show me the model give me a decimal ryan 52 hundredths 52 hundredths yeah okay so you are going to show 52 hundredths times give me a number elika
33 tenths yes okay so 52 we can not do 52 though we have to do 50 for right now we are not there yet 50 hundredths times 3 tenths so model that on your paper use the graph do not worry about where it says decimal fraction simplified that is for another activity
we are just interested in the hundredths chart you can use crayons you can use colored pencils you are going to model it
you are modeling it you are showing me the answer using your model so 50 hundredths times 3 tenths what would that look like as a model
50 hundredths what is 50 hundredths show me 50 hundredths on your model here what does 110th look like okay so what does 5 tenths look like
so you should be shading in blue and yellow works best why does blue and yellow work best because you can see the color you can see the color change
and the color change is what you do not have to use those colors i am just telling you it is easier to see i like the way sawyer is turned out these need to stay there okay so nathan what am i going to shade in 1st
55 tenths 5 tenths so 5 tenths is what how am i shading in 5 tenths
i am not sure if it will i think there is a bell to be on there huh you got it on pink yeah it is on pink because that is what it was set as that is what we are going to leave it as do we have to have the colors change no you do not have to it is just easier to see the answer if you do that okay so 5 tenths in one direction
what am i doing in the next direction
is the red light are you using highlighters yes okay so what does that mean it is overlapping what does this mean
so what is 50 hundredths times 3 tenths 1515 what 15000 hundredths 15 hundredths okay does that make sense yes 50 hundredths times 3 tenths is going to give me 15 hundredths no yes tell me
andrew if it is 2 decimals it could get smaller or larger since you are multiplying below a whole you are multiplying below a whole so our decimal is going to be . smaller smaller it is not larger okay next one what is shown by the decimal model i want you to do this model on your paper on your graph and i want you to tell me what the number sentence should be
on our in our notebook in your notebook so you have blank models
you are drawing this model and you are telling me what number sentence would be correct for that model
do not forget to write your number sentence for the 1st one also that we did every model needs to have a number sentence with it yes the 1st one and that one and excuse me
the colors are just switched yes it is is not it
write your number sentence your number sentence needs to have what you are multiplying by and you need to have the answer what is the answer to a multiplication problem hey you are daydreaming you do not have time to daydream you should have already modeled that one on your paper here
okay so what is the 1st model that is going across what does it show 5 tenths 5 tenths what does the next one show 3 tenths 3 tenths so we have 5 tenths times 3 tenths is going to give me what okay what did you notice it was the same one that you chose earlier is not that funny
so which one is it a b or c c c c is correct okay next one now show this decimal model what does it show put it on your paper as an example then try to find the number sentence okay you just have to move to the next one because you were not done do that one do that one
do this one
it is fine you are just worried about having graph models you are not really worried about what that worksheet says
okay write the number sentence what does that show okay instead of counting what could you have done instead of counting all those individual boxes
multiply multiply 4 times 7 is what 2828 make sure you put your decimal okay what is my number sentence 4 tenths 4 tenths times 7 tenths 7 tenths is going to give us what it is going to give us a what is the answer to this what does this represent 2828 hundredths this purple represents what
7 tenths 7 tenths and this represents four . 4 tenths and when you multiply them together you get 28 hundredths 28 hundredths good okay next one you should model this one just write the number sentence you do not have to do the model just write the number sentence math journal is fine you do not have to model this one just write in your math journal write the number sentence i think we have the modeling
we are pretty good so i should see a number sentence that includes what are you multiplying by and the answer
okay which one is what am i writing here 2 tenths 2 tenths times 5 tenths equals 10 tenths so this represents what five . 5 tenths this is 2 tenths and then this is 10 tenths or 110th okay write the number sentence for this one you do not have to do the model
just write the number sentence look at the model
okay i need to see number sentences check your answer here where is your number sentence makai okay how many
okay count all the way up and all the way over each color like how many do i have going this way 66 what tenths tenths how many do i have going this way
7 tenths so this is 7 tenths this is 6 tenths so this whole section here is the overlapping this is not just the rows that you were looking at you have to look at them this way you saw the 3 yeah you have to look at them this is the whole one color this is the whole one color so what is this answer
40 two . 42 hundredths so we have 6 tenths times 7 tenths equals 42 hundredths i saw a lot of 3s out there 3 tenths and you saw 3 tenths because you were just looking at this one color of 3 you have to look this way because this is shaded all the way across this is shaded all the way up does that make sense 0 remember
so if that confuses you you need to do the model so that you can actually see what you are doing okay so for this one it is going all the way . across across up so you count up how many is that seven . 7 tenths how many is here 110th 110th so 7 tenths times one tenths is going to give you 7 tenths because you should have how many shaded in here
7 overlapping 7 hundredths this is 110th and this is 7 tenths or 70 hundredths or 10 hundredths you can look at it either way because they are what
they are equivalent okay now what we are going to do is you have some cards on your desk and i am going to move a few of you but i am going to explain to it 1st some of you have already played this game before because we introduced it . yeah the other day
so you are going to have your cards you are going to face them all down someone turns a card over you roll the dice so i turn the card over i roll the dice so i have one and 936 if i rolled the dice and got a 5 you are going to multiply that answer by 5
this is not a game you the person who rolled is going to work it out everybody else is going to check it to see if they are correct if they are correct they get the point you just keep playing this game until you use all the cards you can keep a chart with your initials
so like this group has riley mia zuhal hayden left for a few minutes so you are just going to keep a tally of who points you get one point for every correct answer okay i am going to move some of you around so you 3 are a group you 4 are going to move to this table
can we bring our math journal you take your math journal because you have got to do your work in your math journal cheyenne if you will move down one makai move back we need a scissor you do not need scissors and glue anymore here is your cards you are going to do you are going to play here so we put in the cards 0 we forgot to glue that in we will glue it in in a minute we do not need scissors glue and carpentry not yet so you move back you are working with this group
okay i need 12345 you all move to the round table cheyenne you all are staying right here you all are working here okay faithful come sit right here well i am confused makai you are sitting right here there is no confusion you moved without me telling you to move
you are sitting here i told you this does not matter you all are all playing this game we are not eating snack right now faithful you all are going to have to hold off i put my wrapper in the trash okay well just put it in a paper towel we do not want food on the math stuff okay somebody turn over a card
okay roll the dice zuhal turned over the card she rolls the dice does she solve it the fastest nope she solves it all of you are going to be doing the same problem to make sure she is correct if she is correct she has to multiply it 1st if she is right she gets the point do they need 2 no one is yours shh on your bottom
have a seat have a seat shh have a seat okay you all should have already had one problem done who turned who rolled it
everybody else should be solving it with you to see if you are correct okay why do you all have so many cards who did it 1st who went 1st okay maddie you go 1st where is your math journal and pencil there is your number solve it
everybody else is solving it while you are solving it to see if you are correct if she gets it correct she gets a point okay nathan have a seat okay whose turn is it solving it
okay so you all should be solving it along with her so that you know that she is correct okay that is multiplying by 10 do you have to do all that work for that how could you do that you just add a 0 you just add a 0 is that how that works no it does not how it works what would ms hood say if you just said just add a 0 she would say . so she would say i am just going to add a 0 to my paycheck and see what i get right just going to add a 0
truitt to add zeros to my paycheck and see what she says what does it mean to multiply by 10 to just move the decimal move the decimal to what what does that mean to the right huh to the right okay so i am going to move my decimal on my paycheck to the right ms godfrey i reviewed this last night what does that mean what jasmine add a place value add a place value so i am multiplying by another what not a whole not a whole
another place value so you are multiplying by a 10th yeah so you would move the 0 right and you would put the decimal right there correct you can not just add a 0 shh okay logan get busy
i do not know if she can be correct without a decimal wrong you got an 8 there right that would be the correct answer but you have to make sure you have all parts of the answer correct
0 this one needs a mark 0 yeah does anybody else get a point i get a point no you just get a point if you get it right hey i get a point i got a point i think i will do tally marks so i am doing it that way do it this way
and then when you give 5 that is easier to keep count 0 bottoms you have got to be on your bottom faithful it is a good idea to have one person keep score for everybody
okay we have to figure that out 0 yeah 609 dude 16 i do not know who did you get 0 not 12 where are the 10s i do not know i do not know what did you get
sloppy writing is what that is called what are you guys doing this is really easy huh okay so if you want to make it harder what could you do you could get 2 dice and make a 2 digit number or you could make it a decimal you can make it harder go get another decimal or another cube
i could do this 0 you could you could multiply the decimal by the decimal you can make it harder if you want i did because i did not want them up on the desk shh okay faithful bottom you messed up do not be mad those are 6 you can not change your answer
and it was an 8 before what did you do wrong say what did you do wrong i did 4 times 4 wrong because 4 times 4 is what 1616 did you add 4 +4 to get 8 did you add or did you multiply wrong i multiplied wrong because 4 times 4 is 16 okay all right next one draw a card yeah they got a table here huh they have to tie well no whose turn was it
it was makai is okay so did makai get it correct yeah okay do you have that problem set up correctly though where do you put that 4 when you are multiplying the decimal under the one so i do not get anything i am just telling you for future this is how you need to write it noise because when you have 2 digit numbers that you start multiplying that is not going to work
this is what it is going to look like that is going to confuse you so you need to make sure that you write it correctly
0 i thought when you meant like line up then you like line up where it is . no you do not have to line up numbers in multiplying decimals noise i am knocking shit everywhere in the place you just made it a 9 did not i already get that card ms godfrey can i go to the restroom please yes
yay 10 again that is i got 3.6 i beat you andrew i beat you aw man come on 10 come on 10
is that down no it rolled off the table i am being generous 0 man he can not yeah he did see see
multiply the decimal by a double digit number i did these 2 down there by a double digit okay keep going how many should you all have left on here
that is not fair lots
no come on guys you guys did this we have 2 bottoms to get up guys we decided to bring it all the way in
no but you are going to like i am going to like yeah right 0 yay what is what are you guys trying 0 okay
okay we are going to do that okay okay you have 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left do not start that yet
2 minutes left do not start riley she does not know yet
why do not you just do it real quick and that is always your guy okay okay one minute you have one minute left
so if you will start finishing up the last problem putting the cards back in the bag
you all did not have bags because i had it on the table yeah that is right so that is my point right you are right
33 you are right yours is correct okay i won clean up go back to your seat do not put anything away you are going to need it 54 faithful you have to stay there you can not move because of the camera 32 no one you should be ready logan should be ready
you are waiting for the next directions okay on the board is your ticket out the door you are going to show me what you know about multiplying a decimal if i am talking you are not i told him to sit there can you move into mia is desk please you are going to show me what you know about modeling a decimal by a decimal so you need out 2 colored pencils or crayons
it does not matter to me what you do i am giving you paper write your name on it 1st put your hand down please let me give directions put your name on it 1st you should have 4 graphs left over on your worksheet that i gave you earlier 5 some have 5 some messed up so some people have 4
you are going to show the model for 123 and 4 you are going to write the number sentence you are going to show me the answer and write the answer so you have got to do the model cut it out glue it onto the paper write the number sentence above or below it does not matter put your name on your paper is the 1st thing you need to do you have like 10 minutes to get this done you have to draw it on your graph that i gave you
you are modeling it on here you are cutting this out gluing it on this paper writing the number sentence you will have to share scissors if you do not have your scissors with you i have a couple but i do not have enough for everybody okay since this is your ticket out the door should you be talking to the people around you no
no wait you do not do that yet where is your graph paper okay show me the 1st model show me 30 hundredths times 7 tenths cut it out you are gluing it onto the paper we do it 1st and then . it does not matter to me how you do it faithful have you got started where is your graph okay because you were not in here
who else was not in here dylan do you have graph paper no you have to show me with colored pencils you can not show me shading with pencil it has to be colored pencils there is crayons in this box over here
okay so you are cutting this out you are gluing it on here how could i do all at once let us do it one by one i have some blue scissors somewhere let me go get them who has my blue scissors someone come get them off the desk 0 you know what
okay since you did it this way what way do you have to do it next i did it across across you got to go up huh okay what are you doing you are shading in what what are you shading in next 530 i am on the 2nd 10 you are on the 2nd one where is the 1st one in here okay cut it out glue it
go ahead and do that okay so when you multiply these together you have got 2 wholes and 110th left over left over huh the answer where is your model i am doing it now okay
i want you to check that answer when you do your model i want you to check your answer when you do that model where is the model is this it yeah okay so this is 2 wholes and 10 hundredths what is this answer
21 hundredths 21 hundredths what do you have as your answer
you are not doing are you doing 5 okay so that is 110th i am doing the 2nd one okay so this is 2 tenths and then you have to show 3 tenths 4 tenths 5 tenths you want to shade in the whole 10th why are we shading in the whole 10th why do we want to make sure we shade in the whole 10th you want to see what what do you want to see
if this is 7 tenths and this is 5 tenths what are you wanting to know you are wanting to know the what 10th what is overlapping what the answer is so that is 7 tenths times 5 tenths equals what
3500s 3500s i feel like something was wrong because you were not shading in the whole 10th you were just trying to shade in these few down here
i was just wondering where i was supposed to do it like that yes you are supposed to color over the other color
