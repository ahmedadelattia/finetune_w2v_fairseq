good morning everyone good morning mister jones now listen carefully listen again all right this morning we will continue exploring exploring fractions all right and fractions now remember fraction we are only revising a few things before we get into the practice we have been exploring these fractions now fabio could you tell us something about fraction when you are thinking fraction yes one half is the biggest one half is the biggest fraction that is good so we put the word biggest greatest larger bigger greater larger this is comparing so you are kind of comparing or ordering now that is one thing
another 118th is the smallest one for which one now for what we did and we are going to look at this 18th was the smallest but that is not the smallest fraction there is more fraction could go down low low low but 18th was the one we did for the set remember it is about the set so we did fraction of an area fraction of a set fraction of a group these are the things we have been working on we are going to revise a few minutes for 2 minutes that is why i have you all together here so we could look at it and explore more and go deeper and then go in the practice in your book and i will tell you what page i am going to put them on the board the page that i would like you to work with a partner when we finish some people no no no some people i already know .
and some people i already kind of know but i am going to walk around and see how do you integrate the practice we did i mean the lesson we introduced and i put a few posters up there about fraction now what do we notice in a fraction something we talked about yesterday and we talked about right somebody yeah numerator numerator and a denominator there is always and what did we learn i am going to pick on one person naila when we say can i see you still yeah when we say numerator or denominator tell me something about denominator naila naila something about denominator what does it represent what does when you see the denominator what do i have in mind
the whole process the whole thing everything everything of the fraction that means the whole area or the whole group or the whole set how many is in it is the denominator like i have 3 fractions up there i have 3 i have and then hold on i have a half and i have 58th i mean 510th and i have 244 and it is the all halves but we could tell 510th and 10 is the denominator and it is 10 it is divided it is divided into 1010 pieces 10 pieces that is the big idea all right
now i bring this part too i bring i bring this part that show you the whole the fraction how many how many in this fraction one half 2 whole see it is 2 but it is 2 halves right and then we have the whole again from 0 it is a fraction line from 0 half to one half and then 222 halves 2 halves yes 2 halves all right see all right next one if we want to divide it the whole in in let me wait for all in yep and nixon and michael and michael yes and michael so if i want to divide my .
my whole into halves or if i want to divide my whole in 4 people yeah so this is my whole this is 14th 24th which is the same as one half thank you and i have 34th which is the same as one half 1213rd yeah 14th i am going like this one half 13rd kind of close to 13rd but it is kind of well wait a minute what you said is fine it is kind of close
3 fourths is kind of almost 4 fourths almost so it is very close to 4 fourths which is the whole thing because i break it into 4 pieces and i could do the same here for 5 and if i have my whole and i go into i break my whole into 55 this is what happened so i have 15th 2 fifths 3 fifths 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 5 fifths so which is closer excuse me which is closer 334th and 45th or 34th and 35th which which one is closer 34th . which one is closer together i mean which one is kind of similar
closer together 34th could you maybe put your that is it 34th 35th 34th and 35th or 34th and 45th 34th are they almost both of 25th almost a whole yeah they kind of almost right and then we are looking into 8th that is the 8th 8th the 8th and then see 4th that is what we did half become 4th 4th become 8 which name 4th become become 8th if i want to put my whole into smaller fraction 8th right then if i want to go that same half i want to put it in 5th and that 5th i want to put it in 10th what am i doing here when i am looking right here excuse me excuse me
when i am looking right here look look look i put that 55th right here 55th and i am lining it up with the half so what are we doing the pattern equivalent thank you yeah yeah that is another word we are going to so we looking i see i look we have the vocabulary up there equivalent small group now let us look at a group we we did the group before but now we are going to go over it again before i send you into the practice in your book with the pattern all right in a minute now look at me look at me up
you may go and fix it for me please what thank you thank you thanks good job you did a good job guys can you go further up that is it thanks all right now listen may i have your attention attention again christine i need your attention the day before this is what we did and that is why we revised it on the poster when i put the poster up when i put the poster up so people are able are able to look at what we are those posters that i put up so people are kind of looking oh we did this but we are going to do it for a group all right look again look look this is .
thank you look again see this is what we did we are kind of revising it see we take the group and we you remember we had a half we put the group in half in half all right then we said half of this group we did the half this way and we did it that way also this is half again we did half that way all right we did half the 2 different ways we did it this way we did it that way and we decided we decided we call it half 2 ways half or or 121224 because we know for . equivalent the rectangle
and we also go with the equivalent all right so 12 24 is half of this fraction or this set or this group or this group let me wait for rudy yeah rudy yeah show me thank you all right next one come here all right next one we were going to 14th 14th of that half or we could decide we decided we decided 4th or 4th of that same set is is 6 is 6 pieces and it is out of the whole thing which is 24
and 14th we put it right there the equivalent of for this set which is 24 is thank you 6 yeah so 14th how many how many of this how many 4th is of half yeah 66 but another word for this 4th is what half half of what half of the half of the half half of the half is 6 half of the half is 14th that is what we were looking into again and let us continue what is this here look at this anybody anybody anybody you need to raise raise your hand please
let me go into luji luji what is this here can you read this fraction only luji thank you thanks for your help we are looking into this fraction here we can leave this one which is 14th now how many 4th of this one luji how many 4th wait a minute 12 34th 34th 34th is this 14th 24th 34th oh i could do it this way 14th 24th 34th oh and what do i have here that is shaded 34th 34th and that this is not 24th but this is 34th 34th of the whole set is shaded and that 34th oh i put it right here
i had it right here that 34th is how many
this was 6 but i have 3 of these how many is it 81219 she is not even looking you are not even looking up there 3 look look look look some people are not looking let me see those that are i know if ludi was looking she would be the 1st one telling me if you were paying attention and i am looking for your attention samantha where are you naila chrislene chrislene can you yeah thank you now chrislene i have 14th here which is 624 now 34th must be how many pieces chrislene 4 yeah now i have your back 34th must be how many pieces luji luji look up there
i have 14th look 14th is 6 pieces of the whole set 34th must be how many pieces 3 thank you 34th is how many of the whole set 1818 oh my god
yes well okay but they did not get it but they did not get it i need them to get it too see you were able to get it but some wait a minute ludi ludi yes your attention is on me all right so next one yes camille the question is for you now look at me what i have done yes if anybody want to help camille they can raise their hand now what am i doing i am going down i am going down so the fraction is going one half 14th and this one become 13 excuse me yeah of the whole set the whole set the whole set
what do i read this fraction it is half of 14th it is 3 pieces you people are not really paying attention the same word odd numbers but they are not really looking like dolly is not really yeah okay with jimmy i know it is one and 18th 18th who said that me oh samantha is really there because we have done this before we are revising yes all right now excuse me now somebody now i have naila back now naila can you explain why do we call this 18th yeah why do we call this 18th because . look at this one and look at this one why do we call this 18th okay
why do we call this 18th oh somebody is ready naila can you explain yes sir yes with . thank you so 3 and . that is why we call it another name an equivalent of this one excuse me
so it is 324324 which is equivalent to 18th for this set 18th 18th okay now listen i am going to erase this and i need people is attention because i am going to ask you another question we never talked about before yes we have 13rd we have 13rd i mean we have one half we have 14th
look at me oh yeah that same set and how many is in this set 24 so we know 3 pieces is how many what fraction 3 pieces 3 pieces is what fraction 18th 18th of the whole set and that is 324 do we make it clean thank you thank you very much it is hard to it is hard to keep it up next one listen what did we learn no wakudowali let us go wakudowali right michael what else did we learn we learned 18th let us go back we are revising a little bit let us go back one more fraction we learned with the whole set
the whole set
chrislene wow okay half we will put one half and one half must be this way 1224 okay oh that one half is 1224 right another fraction we learned for the set now i have you back okay yes 14th and we put them in order and that 14th must be okay all right so that is what what do we call it what is the equivalent
624th 624th i have you back 624th now listen this is a new question and people need to think people need to think this is my sandwich half of my sandwich is 12 pieces out of 20 24 that is half of my sandwich remember we said this is considered as a sandwich that i am eating now 14th if i decide to eat a 4th of my sandwich it would be 6 pieces out of 24 now if i decide to eat 13rd 13rd of my sandwich how many pieces would that be you need to think and i am letting people think hm
and i am letting people think and then i will say you know hold on excuse me we said 14th is 6 pieces out of 24 and we put it here right one half is 12 pieces out of 24 and we could see half half of half is 4th half of 4th is 8 because of the number right now i am asking you a question and i am going to give you a chance to talk talk to your friend and say i want 13rd of my 13rd of my 8 pieces all right excuse me
13rd of my 24 pieces you could talk to your friend for a minute yeah 3 friends are talking 3 are talking good job let me see let me see yeah good rudy is talking over there i am looking for 13rd i want to eat 13rd how many pieces would that be good job how many pieces well jamie you may talk to anyone yeah talk to someone naila yeah whistling you may get into that talking yeah you may listen to them listen what they are saying when i raise my hand i am going to raise my hand in a minute 13rd how many pieces 13rd yeah a 3rd of my sandwich i am eating only a 3rd how many pieces would that be
13rd no sorry 4 okay back let us get back 8 good job i am back back no no no no let them let them 212 somebody somebody is waiting i am nixon collins collins darlene good job now listen i am going to ask one person and if it is if you find that same answer do not tell me what to do please all right now if it is listen i am going to show you one thing darlene now if it is the same answer we got to that person what do we do leave it out there yes
yes all right now rudy i am always calling your name and i know you very yes yes all right now what was the answer how many how many pieces would it be in what fraction numerator and denominator now let me wait for camille camille how many pieces we said 13rd of this set how many pieces might it be oh one some people are not listening some people were not listening i heard some people were talking excuse me nixon do not do that thank you get up nixon
so i hear 3 people were talking and i heard the answer kind of but i was not sure right nixon what did you talk me about i said we said we said we talked about yeah we talked about listen listen girls girls yeah we said 12 over 24 is half yes yeah and then we are going to see the 13rd yeah 13rd must be 13rd must be 13rd of this set must be 13rd i am going to find this and i okay that is what you talked about right yeah now let me go to another group okay let me go to another group excuse me now you need to listen
if it is your answer you need to go yes but if it is not then you need to say oh how oh how hold on dolly dolly listen listen to another group thank you
now listen to me listen we are looking for how many pieces would be 13rd how many pieces would be 13rd 18th why do you say 18th we already know 18th is 3 pieces oh 6 it is 3 pieces 123 and we know 15th is 6 pieces now we are looking for 13rd oh wow and using the same strategy now listen michael yes michael calm down all right listen why is 18th somebody was telling me yesterday me 8 times 3 is 2424 hold on i said 24 i remember it was you that is okay all right so 8 x 3 is 24 very good hold on
i am showing you something very important 4 times 6 is 24 and that is why we see oh this is 14th we transfer what we have learned before into the fraction all right another 12 times 12 is 24 and that is how we know half is 24 now can we use that strategy to get 13rd maybe what can we do to get 13rd what can we time 3 times 83 times equal 24 that tells us how many pieces 8 pieces not 18th 8 pieces that is what i asked you how many pieces would be 13rd hold on you said .
i heard you were saying that but you missed kind of you go with 18th 18th is something different to a fraction you know what listen i am trying to kind of help you understand the way you said it and the way you told me is different so 13rd must be let me see 123456785678 so let us see look at that look look look before we go into our book so this is what we call 13rd and how many pieces is that 8 good 53rd so now how many 8 look she is not looking she is not looking she is thank you
yes so 18th 18th 18th how many 8th how many 8th how many 8th 6 you are not looking see 18th 18th 18th how many 8th 33 times 824 so the fraction for 18th another way an equivalent fraction would be is it 324 or 824824 because it is 8 pieces we call it 320 328 how many pieces 328 no but if i have the whole thing is 24 aha 3 look look we said 13rd is 624 so this one must be how many pieces
888 pieces so 824 is the same equivalent to 324 is the same equivalent to 13rd of this set thank you yep all right yes now any questions let me see people that has questions regarding regarding regarding the fraction of this set fraction of this set now if i have 16th i mean 13rd 13rd becomes 16th because half of 3 is 6 so 16th how many pieces would that be the smart people let me call see the smart people excuse me
16th 13rd is 8 pieces so 82416th must be 4424 oh you all getting it 424 do you see now i get you back yeah you get me back yeah i get you back yes right see so this one is equal same thing as 4 24 because 4 times 6 is 24 now i get you luji do i really get you back yes you get this piece yes when i say 16th must be because 13rd is 824 so if i go 16th must be e times e
see what we are doing we are matching facts time factors equals factors equal product we are kind of combining a lot of the learning we have done before
no the whole area the denominator i see some people are not paying attention so what i am going to do and i will go to 13rd 16th and one 18th 112th no 14th 112th 118th oh yes why do you say 112th if i am going down 13rd 16th 112th what would it be 14th no wait a minute this is what we had 84th yeah she gets it it becomes 2 if i go 112th equals 2 2 oops
sorry 224th 124th 124th 124th is what one 148th 148th okay now you get it now yes good job i like that all right now another one and then we will go into our book yes yeah and practice and practice now remember we went into a different different set we went into a different set we went into 13rd for this set one 23rd for this set people that are looking with me 13rd see 13rd of this set let me see 13rd let me make it 13rd some people those guys on my left are good are good are smart are smart i get it
i am getting smarter every day i am always smart i am always smart you are getting me back getting me back fine now listen carefully listen we have a different different set which is we were looking for 13rd how many in this set 313rd wait a minute let me see this one tells us how many in our set thank you it is an area
we did that the day before or yesterday so 13rd must be so it is 13rd is so i have it into 3 yes now i see some people are looking some people are talking and some people see those people that are talking they will not be able to do what we are going to have them do is all right hold on hold on let us wait for the talking so i can do a little bit of it and guide it to chrisline my favorite naila good job all right so 13rd see this is a 3rd another 3rd
so 2 thirds must be how many pieces 20 thank you very much 161620 pieces equals 16 yeah what am i saying i said you got me back okay see and i have 13rd +13rd equals 40404040 hold on that is right 13rd +13rd equals 2 and 2 thirds of the whole set of the whole piece of the whole set of the whole piece or of the whole area
you are getting me back hold on let us wait for these guys okay and they call themselves the smartest you got back me thank you now listen 13rd 23rd can i have 16th yeah 16th yes
see if you start shouting it is not good see now he is talking 16th now see we have 13rd if we are looking for 16th 16th must be wow see some people oh now they are getting smarter let me see if they are talking together chrisline luji and naila and we need people 5 there can not be you know 16th 16th there has to be 15th 16th if we have 13rd we could have 16th yeah i know yeah so how many pieces would that be that 16th must be how many 2 remember look in here that is 13rd 13rd 16th must be what
23rd 13rd 13rd you know if you shout if you are talking then it is not my thing i am not kidding i am not kidding why because you are talking see they do not they did not hear now how many people agree with this group over here all right look look what did they say 16 must be must be what 110 he said 110 no that is what it was 10 faces and we say 106 and 10
equals 6 and let me see 246 hey come back you got me back you you got me back i got you back you got me back i got you back yeah i got you back all right so listen listen listen how many 10s are in here 1110 look look 1101102 no how many 6 are in here 2616162636 let me see 46 this is oh
16 and that is that is 2 that is 22636263646 am i halfway listen am i oh i cannot tolerate the way you turn around while we are doing it no you are talking to someone else no look at him no am i halfway here yeah so 36 must be .
368368 is the same equivalent yes and then we go oh no no no no no am i right look look 16th 26th 36th 46th 46th 76th 56th 106th 6th 76th 56th 106th 6th 66th oh 60 over . oh 6060th all right now wow we learn a lot now we learn a lot oh marco you know how to do it no no no no no no you leave it you leave it you leave it did i say no leave it leave it leave it guys
leave it leave it guys let me see people who are paying attention to me my student my learners hold on sit down sit down sit down my friend virginie you are not listening to me virginie michael michael michael michael you are not listening what direction 1st you need listen let us see cludy good job darlene thank you leave it leave it because we need this darlene you are not sitting and listen what direction now michael is not listening i am losing you see i am losing them yes that is the way all right listen all right thank you good job now that is how i need it
now i am going to have these 3 people you listen to what you are going to do god bless now see you will not give me a chance see people are not really listening . thank you kristen thank you now we are going to go into your your book your book and in that book i want you to work i want you to work on page page one huh listen i will tell you which page
page 13 i am going to put them on the board page 1356 and maybe we will get a chance to do a few problems and the problems are on page 79 and 10 but we will do about 3 okay all right 5 and 6 and 6 all right so i am going to let you work for 10 minutes on this one because some people already did a few of them yeah some people you need 6 that is the one and some people already did a few they understood but now i know they are going to kind of be now listen i am going to have people go back to their seat but not everybody all right michael you may go back gerland gerland you may work with michael if you want to but if you all right now i am going to walk around and see i got it all right i know
all right rudy you are going back to your seat and i am going to send you someone to work with you excuse me now you stay in your seat wait in your seat wegeni in your seat please page one page one page one we are going to omit page one page one we are going to omit what is that page one what does it mean omit omit means leave it leave page one yeah because we have done that before we have done page one you did page one we did page one so we are not going to do page one oh wait a minute we did page one excuse me you did page one so i want you to go on to page hold on
he is not listening page half of a rectangle which page page 5 okay 5 page 5 all right yeah page 5 yeah page 5 all right hold on now let us see some people page 5 page 5 yes 6 now let us look at page 5 page 5 together
and some people have done it and it is easy right yes page 55 good job now let us go into page 5 nixon number one please one page 5 fabio fabio 55 unit 6 page 5 good job see he is not on that in that unit page 5 unit 6 okay wegeni number 2 please wegeni what fraction is that 14th what is your name wegeni no number one no wegeni what fraction on page 5 number 2 is what fraction what do we call it what fraction is shady 66 wow
some people are really not listening that is the thing i know some people can not even look at it and read it what do we look how many what is the denominator the whole thing the whole thing how many pieces can you look at how many pieces denominator no it is number 2 yeah how many pieces 14th so the denominator is 8 so how many is shady 18th 18th yes all right now let us look at another person that is really good at it somebody now i see hands up good job hands up
christlene hands up
my my learners are bad you are messing it up now chris you did so well in this now let let me go into one of the problems on page 9 oh no no let us go oh yeah page 6 is one of the problems that i feel dolly could help with one of the problems dolly okay now it says listen let us see people who are looking at one of the problems on page 6 she is on page 6 on page 6665 do not make 6 michael 6 yes yes good job weginie 6 very good how about christine 6
all right he is going to read the problem for us ethan has 24 marbles thank you that is his set that is the set we are talking about i am done he gives 28 of his collection to his sister ruby how many marbles does ruby get see the question is always they give you the set and they give you the fraction and they ask you how many pieces that is what i have been asking you now i want people and i am going to walk around and see people who think of this set is 24 and how many pieces let me walk around see people and i see some people are drawing the 24 just like we did it here oh they just know oh 24 let me see
let me see the fraction fraction show it yeah how many 28 what did we do when what did we do when we need to find the fraction of a set remember what we just did she is trying and the set has 24 how did we use can we use this that is why i needed you to keep it up see i said keep it up all right so that is why i needed you to keep it up remember what we did here okay so let us go back to the set of 24 all right hold on
look look look in here can i go to the bathroom okay all right hold on hold on we we i have a pencil for people that need to borrow a pencil but listen can i am going to see if this one can help you fabio fabio what we did here we had 24 we had half we had 14th and we had excuse me 18th 18th 18th you are not looking you are not looking see i will get you back all right see 18th and 28th what do you think 28th might be i will take it back that is okay what do you think 28th might be 6
2 would be the so 28th might be the same 6 over 24 how do you know that because because if i know 18th is 328th might be another 3 it might be 666 so now you got me back 3 +3 is 6 i get you yes so 18th is 324 so 28th must be 624 so 28th might be might be 28th might be 624 624 and do i have 6 up here no you have 3 so 28th is the same as as 28th is the same as .
look at this 2 look at this 2 some people are not looking they do not get it she is not getting it see we did it up here we said i knew it 28th must be another 18th 18th +18th equal 28th and then 18th and when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see it is only one no no wait a minute what do i see when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see people are not looking 8 yeah 14th and 28th what do i see the same amount the same amount so what do we call 28th and 14th is equal equavalent thank you very much equal so do you see the number how many pieces 24 now what do we write down for the problem
ruby gets ruby gets ruby gets marbles ruby gets 6 marbles 6 marbles do you write a sentence let me see if people write a sentence yeah the sentence is how many marbles does ruby get 6 ruby gets 6 marbles no that is a u marbles ruby let me see ruby ruby gets 6 marbles do you write it down ruby gets ruby gets 6 marbles ruby gets i like when people put the s ruby gets if you know you can do the 2nd one oh yeah yeah you could use the equation you do the 2nd one those who know because we are about to finish and then i will let you go back
not today but tomorrow oh my god the floor is half of half the book like was and 3 i will know it thank you thank you i know whenever she gets it she explains it i will get you back i will get her back so now look at that she is doing number 2 so if you are doing number 2 let me see because we are about to finish and we did a set we did a problem and then we will continue doing those kind of problems with 24 sets good job quick we are doing the 2nd one number 2 number 2 and then we are about to finish and say what did we learn i learned all right hold on no we know it somebody already do number 2 some people already do number 2 ruby gets how many pieces were you looking when i .
yeah yeah how many pieces did ruby get 66 all right now do the 2nd one let us see you do the 2nd one see people who do the 2nd one quick later on i have for you he is thinking but too loud now let us see he is working she is working she is thinking he is doing he is already done maybe he is not good maybe open it and check it check it out yes
so do you write a sentence did you write it ah i am glad i told you see okay you are all ready 24 wait a minute 34th 34th of 24 remember we learned about 34th of 20 oh 34th of 24 must be must be 24 remember we did all that 35 by 3 we did half look look look people that are looking yes i am glad you are looking see that is 14th that is 24th how many pieces that is half 24th is half and 34th 34th is how many 34th is how many
how many pieces 8 pieces wait a minute 14th 24th 34th 18 pieces 18 pieces yes yes oh good we did that before i do not know why you you said it good job girls i have said it yes did you guys see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see collection i know how many ethan oh yeah sentence she gives okay mister jones got me back got me back the sentence sentence you write the sentence ethan gets 18 toys toys thank you very much what do you write down
i wrote a rubric he said rubric gets 8 cards he said he can get 18 cards open it so we can see it we will we will let you do more problems yeah we will let you do more problems somebody ask him one more one more hold on hold on let me let me stop for a minute look at the ends 2 thank you now i am going to ask a simple question a simple question to dolly dolly yeah give me your give me give me your attention do i have you back chrislene do i have you back yes yes michael i have your back fabio i have your back yes okay
all right see he he is talking if i have you back then you are listening not talking nice now orleans yeah give me one thing we learned during this time of math this morning what did we learn remember what we were you know remember our objective for the for the week for the week for the week all right remember this one here finding sit down finding
student will be able to find fraction part of a group or any area in the num meaning of numerator and denominator thank you very much now i see michael warren really listening yes maybe he could tell me one thing now one thing one thing one thing if you are ready to say one thing that we learned this morning that you feel strong and i could explain it i could write it in my learner is notebook and i could take it home with me it could be any of these it could be any of 24 it could be something but all right all right it could be out of a set it could be any fraction anything right
now one thing today and tomorrow i learned about it oh some people are not listening somebody is sharing some people are not danny is not listening michael is not listening and abigail is not listening oh yeah we are about to finish thank you we are about to finish our lesson and then we need somebody who can tell us a few things we learned simple oh now let us 12 yeah go ahead today i learned the fraction of a set and i learned that danny danny danny is the whole set of a fraction thank you very much that is one thing
one fact about fractions what we learn the denominator is the whole set number or the number in the set all right now can i i will come to you because i know you have something nice but i do not know if luji luji if you are going to write home about math tomorrow i am going to read it in your book good job yeah what is it what would you tell your mom or dad about what we learned today see he is not listening thank you yes
so yes so yes james i heard that a set of fractions could be divided into many sets of pieces thank you we also learned no hold on one fact a set of fractions could be learned into many pieces many pieces many pieces and you could tell the fraction but the fraction pieces see you are not really listening alright next one dolly dolly dolly just a minute dolly yes yeah okay go ahead now today i learnt that no say it louder today we learn how to add fractions add
half +one half but what of a set it could be a set one half of a set +one half of a set is equal to the whole thing how about a word equ equivalent equal anybody pick up anything what is equal what fraction is equivalent equivalent equal she does not know see will i am losing you will now tell me something about equal equivalent yeah okay wait yeah nixon nixon do not talk to him
yeah let us go ignore yeah 7 half 7 half 7 14 is a equal is equal to equal to half equal to something now anything about equal equal equal equivalent she said 7 14 is equivalent to half i got one i got one 7 14 is equivalent to half one half is i mean 12 over 24 12 over 24 is equivalent to a half thank you oh oh 6 over 12 is equal to half half and 13rd is equivalent to
hold on hold on let us finish with half now 13rd 13rd is equivalent to equivalent 262613rd is equivalent to 262 pieces out of 6 pieces we have got your back all right i have got your back all right now listen carefully listen listen for those of you that were paying attention and i know those people who they are they are ready to do more problems she already told me she said oh i can do this can i do more now i am going to give you about one minute 2 no wait a minute one minute to work on the problem but this is the end of our lesson for today but tomorrow we will go in the book and just work in the problem and see people who really are similar all right yes yeah
