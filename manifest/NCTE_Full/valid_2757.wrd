all right so today we are going to work on playing a really cool game called capture fraction but the object of the game is for you to better understand numerators and denominators so the numerator on a fraction is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom
and to understand what does a numerator mean and what does that do in fraction and denominator what does that mean and what does that mean in a fraction and then today we are going to continue to ask you to identify equivalent fractions who can quickly remind me what are equivalent fractions yeah equal equal so equal equivalent so fractions that are exactly the same who can quickly give me an example of a equivalent of a set of equivalent fractions yeah 2 fourths and a half
2 fourths and a half excellent so we have 24th and a half they are equivalent that means that they are the same they have the same value or they have the same shade and places and then today you are going to put them in order where you compare a fraction and you have to use a series of thinking and thinking about equivalence and relationship to tell me how to understand what is bigger than the other
does that make sense okay so you are going to actually explain while you are playing the game understand what is numerator and denominator share how your strategies and how you figure out how things are equivalent and also explain how you put things in order when you compare fractions any questions on what we need to do today no all right so what i have here is 2 fractions let me erase that 1st
okay 14th and 3 fifths in it in the game then what we are going to play is figure out who is bigger which is a larger which is a bigger one okay so you have 14th and 3 fifths which fraction is bigger so what i would like you to do is turn within your team and talk about what do you think which is bigger 14th or 3 fifths
okay so it is 2 see 14th 3 times 4 equals 12 okay so what does that mean shuxian what did he just do i heard a lot of numbers i know 4 times 3 equals 12
one times 5 equals 5 huh so 3 fifths is bigger 3 fifths is bigger is that do you agree that it is is that what you said okay do you agree with it yeah okay so can you tell me if there is another way that you can figure out which one is bigger 4 times okay maybe like 3 fifths is bigger how do you know because because 3 fifths is bigger
i remember yesterday you said like like yesterday you said you have like candies if you if you eat like 2 of them you save 3 of them but then 14th they they eat less yeah they eat less they eat less okay if you also add the leftover just the waffle has the bigger one just the 0 okay so you are just looking at what is leftover
okay that is an idea but i want to go back to to think about what amy just said so she said well you only ate one whereas you ate 3 here but are they the same for each one no so okay think about that would that be a good way to think about well this one ate one this one ate 3 is that a fair way to think about it 0 i know if you cross across the middle it will be 245
but is this one the same so for example if i were to take this one and i apologize my drawing is not very good they are not equivalent they are not equal but if this this one is it the same as much as this one no how do you know because the square one that looked like a square but that looked like a rectangle yeah big rectangle okay
if you take one as 15th and you say the denominator is bigger than the it is small okay so you have 15th and then you have 14th so because you had to split more where the denominator is bigger then that is why 15th is actually smaller than 14th so knowing that how so you have to be conscious about that this one and this one are totally different
okay good job what do you guys think 14th i think 14th 14th is bigger because last time you said the bigger number the the smaller pieces you get when you eat less you get more pieces but when you eat more you get less pieces it is like the denominator it has more
you eat less when the denominator is greater you eat more you only have like 2 left and when the denominator is smaller you have more left okay does everyone agree in here yeah wonderful all right so i heard some interesting way of finding out which one is greater okay so who would like to share with me 1st anthony 3 fifths is bigger how do you know 3 fifths is bigger because 4 times 3 is 120 so using that strategy
okay team one so anthony can you come up and show me what you mean by that
okay so can you tell me what you did 4 times 3 is 12 and 3 times 5 is 5 like 44 equals one whole and there is 15 and then there is one there is like 2 is one and 4 and can you speak a little bit louder i do not think i can hear you
like 44 is one whole and then there is one more left so there is one and one whole and 12 over 555 equals no not 5 equals one whole and then there is 7 left and then i add another 55 and then there is 2 wholes and there are 2 left so there is 2 okay
junhong do you agree with him no how so thank you anthony
so is that okay so what does do you agree with him then yeah then tell me why you would agree with him if you were telling me that he forgot to times to multiply by 5 in here what do you think i think like you skipped me
well what about someone else what do you think because what anthony did is interesting he multiplied 5 times one to make 5 and then 4 times 3 makes 12 then he said that is why 3 fifths is bigger but then he did all of this so i guess my question to you is when you did this just say this part right here you changed you totally changed the value of 14th
i do not know how 14th is equivalent to 5 fourths do you know what i mean so that is something to think about and what junhong was saying well junhong can you tell us what you were doing you were trying to do here i mean like he just did like one he just times the numerator in there but he did not times the denominator okay
so he did not need to do if he times the denominator so he did not need to do this one okay so you think that he just skipped one step is that right anthony i mean he changed a step he changed the value of 14th he just like if he you had to speak a little louder if he times the denominator it would be like it would be the same denominator okay so you are looking for the same denominator
so it would be 520 and then the other one would be this and then you would see that since can you tell me that then since they have the same denominator then you can compare it 0 does that make sense good job thank you
all right with someone else with a different strategy how did you figure out whether or not 14th is greater than 3 fifths well there were some interesting things that were happening here 0 suddenly 0 i do not want to talk about it please stop do not look at me you know what since you do not want to talk about it i will bring it up okay so earlier this team were having a very interesting conversation
they were talking about well what is left over they are focusing on the left over part and they say and do you want to continue tell me what you just you said no no okay so they were saying that there is a lot more left over versus this so you have 3 fourths left over and amy how much do you have left over here 2 fifths 2 fifths
and she is saying that 3 fourths is greater than 2 fifths then that means yesterday we talked about when you have left over the more you eat the less you have left huh the less you eat the more you have left right yep when we eat candies or brownies or whatever a huge slice a huge pizza so how much the more you eat the less you have left the less you eat the more you have left
but then there was a conversation that you guys you both team had that was a little was quite interesting and we i feel that we should talk about it is talking about that one some of you are saying well this one ate one and this one ate 3 so that is why this one is bigger why is why should it not be that way shuxian
because the denominator is not the same the denominator is not the same what does that mean when the denominator is not the same kenny it is not cut into the same pieces it is not cutting into the same pieces excellent job so when the pieces are not the same i could have 14th of something
but if i cut something into 5 pieces and i tell you that i eat all 5 of them even though my denominator is bigger but i actually ate more because i ate more pieces so you can not just rely on looking at the denominator you should also look at the numerator as well does that make sense so there are a couple of ways of thinking about solving figure out how one is bigger than the other now junhong you mentioned that you have another strategy
what strategy do you have this one do you do you want me to erase some of them it is this 100 yeah 0 yeah remember let me out of your way
0 we are comparing 3 fifths honey okay can you tell us what you did i did 1st i did i split the line cut the line into 4 groups and here is how big is 14th and here is how big is 13 fifths so what did you do with 3 fifths
compare how long who is who is longer but how did you know that that was 3 fifths cause here here i split into 5 groups and here is the
wait while junhong is fixing his who can tell me why junhong cut his the top line into 4 pieces joyce because the denominator is 4
the denominator is 4 so he knows that he needs to cut into 4 pieces and junhong is now doing i am trying to figure out what junhong is doing right now he is doing the that is okay you are right on target he is doing the p m g what is p m g
0 okay like on the mcat where it says where is p where is m okay 0 okay so kenny can you tell us what you were trying to tell him i did not say
no so i i guess okay so tell me how junhong would should draw it then 01 if you try to cut it in 4 to make it equal what should the 1st thing you do half cut it in half right and then how do we find 14th half of half
half of half and then half of half of half so 3 fourths right so on the bottom he is trying and it is kind of hard it is just like what i did here it is hard to see when your line is not exactly the same or my square is not exactly the same so just bear with us so we have the same thing 0 and one so how would i do this one how many parts do i need to cut it 155 because i have 3 fifths
so it is 14th and we need to do 3 fifths so we can not so we know that if i do half right here okay just to keep a gauge as to where things are so i know that 15th 25th are less than half and 35th is it less or more than half more more than half
so you can kind of play with it a little bit and just try to be a little bit try to make sure that it kind of stays within the same amount of increments so 3 fifths is here so that can help you to see that 3 fifths is longer than 14th bigger than 14th does that make sense yes okay so that was really good i did not think of that myself all right so there are quite a few ways that you boys and girls can think that up to help you to figure out which is greater
so you can do what anthony was doing earlier going to crisscross and that magic rule that you guys like using you can change it into common denominator that means they share the same denominator so you can compare it or you can look at like what these 2 teams were talking about look at what is left to help you to figure out which is greater or you can use a number line to help you to figure out which is greater those are all wonderful strategies
so that is what we are talking about using the equivalence and the reasoning with equivalence and relationship to help you to figure out which is greater and which is less all right any questions no okay so today you are going to play a game called capture fraction you only you need 2 decks your own deck and your partner has a deck so basically what you are going to do is kind of shuffle the card and you on your 1st do not try to pick some of you are like i am going to try to pick the biggest one well here is a small one i am going to pick one no
whatever is on your top deck put it face down put it that way and then no one is trying to cheat the top card take it out your partner takes one out and then you have to see who is greater okay if you have a greater like this fraction yeah from the top this way you get to keep your partner is card okay so whoever has the most number of cards on the end wins now but then i would like you may i can we mix it ms luis
you can if you like on page 33 in unit 6 on page 33 it says finding equivalent fractions when you are there anytime that you find a fraction that is equivalent that means the same thing the same value then you write that down so for example half is equivalent to 4 eighths
then you would write half equals 4 eighths so when you find another fraction set a fraction or that are equivalent then you should write it down to keep track of it now if you happen to have a card that you are equivalent then you both keep your own card okay does that make sense yes okay any question of what you need to do no yes andrew but just we will figure it out can we split it
if your partner does not have his or her cards then yeah if you do not mind splitting it that would be great yeah what if you could just put that in the deck over here at the point that is a good point if you have a card that is equivalent you know what let me see you should get a c d 0 sorry if you have an equivalent card totally lost that
the equivalent card so for example shuxian and i have a set of cards that are equivalent she has half i have 48 then we deal another card out whoever at the end has the greater one gets all of them 0 that is right sorry my fault does that make sense so if i have half she has a half then it is equivalent then we take out the next card and if hers is mine is one whole her is 13rd then i win because one whole is bigger than 13rd okay
does that make sense any time you find any card that is equivalent write it down any question of what you need to do no no okay who can tell me what we are going to do do not all raise your hand at the same time andrew shuffle it 1st shuffle it 1st yeah good and then what yeah like someone is talking eyes on the person who is talking
like you put one card and your partner put one card if you both have equivalent you keep it okay you hold on to the card and then what you write it down on your piece of paper and then you fill up another card and see whosever is bigger whoever has is bigger will get all 4 cards 0 right because you have 2 cards that are equivalent and then 2 more cards that are out there all right
and whoever has the most cards has more cards at the end will win now junhong and shuxian are like 0 my goodness i need to write my name on all of them so but i think you kind of recognize your own handwriting i hope but if you can quickly write your initial on your card then that is fine too that will help a little bit if you are ready let the game begin yay does tiffany get it yes okay then tiffany explain to us what you how you are doing it
if it is equivalent you keep it but if it is not equivalent then you fill out the next word if it is equivalent then you hold it and then you fill out the next card 0 and then you have to figure it out that was the whole point of the game then you whoever is greater than all of them does that make sense 0
now make sure you have that conversation with your partner as to how do you know that is greater or less or equivalent 18 i have the biggest one so do i keep it okay put it down so she he can look at it too
23 foreign language 812 foreign language and then i did 16 sorry right give me 12nd foreign language yeah
then you keep the card 0 i am putting it in all right 442 yeah 36312 alex are these your cards do you do you split it i can not find mine i will give you a little what
like how are you lost foreign language no show 0 okay but how do you know that yours is bigger because the denominator is smaller 0 smaller right and the p then the piece you got to pick up okay what does that mean
it means like if you like for example if i like ate 2 so let us use this as an example since you have it right here so 2 thirds and 4 tenths which one is bigger this 123rd why do you think so
because like if i eat like if i eat 2 thirds and 84 tenths 4 tenths would be 84 tenths 4 tenths would be 84 tenths no you you have to 0 yeah more more why not
so may i ask you again so here you are saying that i ate 2 he ate 4 but are your pieces the same size mine are smaller so if you look at this as one what is left over is 13rd if you take one this is 110th right so which is greater yeah so could the piece then are the pieces the same size then no
no so you can not so i i do not think it would be accurate to say that this has 2 pieces and that is 4 pieces because this portion is a lot smaller i mean the size is different so imagine if i if i say to you anthony i am giving you a piece of cake this much but i gave him half of my cake he still gets one piece but it is this big so who ate more he did even though you have one piece he has one piece but look at this piece
it is like this big yours is this small right so just saying that one piece would not be a fair way to explain it because the size portion is very different so because of the denominator right so using that think about again who is greater
so if you want i i think correct me if i am wrong but what i am hearing you saying that you are focusing on this part right here what is left over right because you said you ate more and i have less right because you ate 4 pieces and i ate 2 pieces so you have more and you have less okay so let us focus on what is left look at that what can you tell me 2321 think about how much do you have left 1st you have 13rd left here and 6 tenths left okay now you are really comparing 13rd and 6 tenths now right
okay so tell me how do you know which is greater why 18 over 1018 over 10 we had that concept before so you are doing the crisscross right
i hate to write on your card may i write here so you are doing 13rd and 6 tenths right and then you go 3 tenths and 6 eighteenths and that is why this is bigger right that is just a way to prove it but i need you to understand it what does that mean
you can play another round did you find any equivalents 1010 wait 0 no 0202 what do you think 16th okay so let us try it this way
all right so you have 13rd left you have 46th left there is 13rd left half of something no no okay so look at 46 okay you have 610 over if you have half of a 10 what would that be 5 so that means what you have left over is more than 5 that means it is more than half in this one you have left over which is less than half then that reverse row again
so if i have less left over that means i have more and then you have more left over and that means you ate less now we did a couple of things here so let us review what we did number one we looked at what is left over we said it was 13rd over this is 6 tenths over left over any questions so far and then we i talked about well i know that 13rd is less than a half half right
and 6 tenths i know half of the 10 is 5 and i have 6 of them that means i have more than half i can actually just erase it and put it right here right all right i have more than half left over so that means the portion that is left over is a lot more that means i ate less right but that is why this is bigger than that so there were a couple of things we did all together look at what is left over
any relationship with half half is a landmark number we love half right we love it then you have half and then use that to compare and then we reversed it you guys are doing like magic here all right so try that with the other cards to see if that strategy those strategies work all right
or that would be a $5 challenge can you try again yeah hey deanne what is up it is hard to weigh up no we do not have any points what do you need honey i did not find any no equivalents no okay let us play again then shuffle the card and play again how are we doing over here did you guys find any equivalents yeah 16th equals to 21286th equals to 14th 86th equals to one half
interesting and you know and you can prove it right see amy can you prove this one to me i have how do you know 36th equals to 3 because 33 +3 equals to 6 so it is a half so it is equal to okay what do you because the numerator is it is a half of the so it works all the time that way
yeah good explain this one to me how is 86th equivalent to one and 14th 0 can i try it yeah when you are in doubt just draw it out wait up
ms luis we have none of this they found it it is just your luck we do not have to shuffle it again okay shuffle it okay so tell me what is happening
i drew like 46th because this is the denominator excellent so but this is right in the middle so i used another 6 and then i have to color 8 pieces so this is already one whole and this is 2 over 6
one and 26th 0 so in fraction what does this think of 21 and 26th right or you can think of it as 13rd right yeah so you have one whole and 26th or 13rd so this is actually not equivalent 0 but you know what amy i love this
yesterday you were having such a tough time and today you are like this is easy this is easy as pie this is great but we just you know what by drawing it you just proved it right so 86th is not equivalent to one and 14th when you are in doubt draw it out that is right how are you in here too bad hey i need to hear some conversation going on here people equivalent
i am so sad she could not think how to wash my small pot and the small pot can wash it with just milk i am so sad how do you know see how do you know she could not look that is why you guys are like speeding through this there is no conversation here i lost 2 so i got all of it how do i even reach one alex
i love it but too much say that again i am sorry i was a little distracted she got 22 whole yeah 0 i love that 0 do not forget these these are yours too shuxian tell me what is happening i do not even see it one and 14th and 5 thirds 5 thirds right
aha have a seat 1st foreign language
4 times 21 times 2 equals 8 so 0 yeah okay is there another way to think about it instead of doing that crisscross like one and 14th 14th and 2 thirds so one and one is 52 thirds now 2 thirds and 14th
yeah and so 2 times one equals 22 times 2 equals 11 times 3 equals 3 say that again you are like 3 times faster than me 2 times what 2 3 times what it is like this yeah but can you just multiply the denominator and then figure out that is the answer
what i do not understand why you did that can you explain that to me because the teacher taught me foreign language so times one is 8 i know she took the same thing but i want to see another strategy
foreign language
foreign language okay i am thinking okay so you used common denominator huh what do you think about that do you use that too when you are finding out the answer no
no what you do the crisscross and call it in yeah 0 i like that way equivalent 0 sorry they were asking some help there what is up guys going good going good did you want to talk to me about something like we are one of them is the same but then and then we can
did you use the strategies that you guys were talking about looking at what is left over and do all that crazy math and then figure it out because you know why anthony i am going to ask you later 0 yes we have the same thing all the time all the time then you keep flipping it 0 whoever is next is going to get all 6 of them what if we have like the same thing then you have the same thing how is this equivalent explain that to me
i feel like i am never here this this one is equivalent 0 we are looking for equivalent 0 so we are not looking for one which is greater than the last one so do we you can not just grab it you have to explain it to her why so do we have the i am just putting like 3
no you need to say take out another card and see who is bigger okay how is this the same though 0 okay because you took the that card out then talk about it which one is bigger sorry he took he is taking all of them
0 you really really do not know tell me what the problem is tell me how will you go how are you going to go about to figure it out i will do it 0 good all right so excuse me i am working with another group when we are done we will talk to you in the meantime why do not you you can figure out what think of all the strategies that we talked about can you use one of those to help you to figure out which one is greater 0 i get it
i got another one all right tell me what you are thinking i think can i write it on here 0 so you do the crisscross right yes all right
tell me another one tiffany what do you think okay team one and team 2 i love that you love the game but quiet down a little bit would you no team 2 and 3 sorry 456 i love how she used the graph paper so that i can actually see it a little easier
it is down there too okay about 2 more minutes boys and girls 1234567891011121314151617181920
all your big numbers are make a total of all your big numbers did you solve the problem good i am happy with my luck today okay so she is doing a number line 0 yes good luck so she has 14th right here where would you put 2 sixths
we have 2 eighths right here why because the denominator is less than the 4 but you have 2 of them no but i just put them right here 0 sorry i asked you where 16th is did not i sorry about that it is like playing cards
it is likes playing cards okay good do you see what she did okay so she is using a number line to help her so here she tried to cut it from 4 equal parts and here she cut it in 6 equal parts 14th on the 1st line she drawed it as 14th
and then one on the 6th line she cut it in 6 equal parts and then she had 2 sixths okay so can i show you another way i was thinking about it yeah i am going to use this 0 think about what is left over you have half more than half right and here you have half is not it then now you have so you can totally figure it out
so they are exactly the same so what is left this and this this is 14th this is 16th so which is greater 14th so that means this part 8 more right so this must be less than that less than 8 all right all right let us return the card to the rightful owner 00
so take your own card take your friend is card out please i do not have i do not have 64 i only have one
if you are ready eyes on me so i know you are ready thank you team one thank you . all right okay so most of us are ready
so can someone share with me what was your strategy what did you do to help you figure out whether or not your card is bigger than your partner is card andrew i used 2 ways one is to put the card in one of the number lines okay so for example i think your card was 14th and 2 sixths right okay so can you come up and tell me what you did please 0 wait a minute you can not sorry you can not be in the camera sorry sorry sorry so can you just tell us what you did
this close and 4 times 2 equals 8 okay and 6 times one equals 6 so i because the the 8 is bigger than 6 so that means 2 sixths is bigger excellent all right so that is one way oops thumbs up if you have tried using this strategy while you were working on figuring out who is greater who is not
okay good most of you and then the other strategy the number line i got one number line and i split it into 4 equal parts okay i noticed that you were very good about putting 0 and one earlier so i want to make sure i put that there it is very important to know that and then you split it in 2 well we 1st split it into a half okay and then a half of the half is 14th okay
and then the other half just put 14th so it will be 3 fourths okay and then one because it is a 14th so that is how far it is 14th and then 126th i draw another number line i split it in half
and because i know one because 16th is less than 14th so i put it to be less than 14th and then i draw another 2 sixths right there next to 14th not on 14th yeah not on 14th okay so that is and the other side i do it the same way
so kind of less than 3 fourths so that would be 3 sixths it will be 4 sixths and then a little bit more than 5 sixths am i correct but given my portions are not exactly the same but it should be so and this is 2 sixths so this is how far 2 sixths is okay any questions for andrew no
but again the importance of drawing your portions to try to be the same so that if i draw 14th like this but then if i i am sorry if i do 14th like this and then my 2 sixths is like this well of course 14th will be a lot longer than 2 sixths right here right so your line needs to be about the same if you can good job okay excellent someone else with a different strategy
so we have 2 strategies so we will call it the crisscross how do you spell crisscross c r 0 s s criss cross applesauce and then do we do the number line okay what did you do the times one the what
times one okay do you want to come up and do it so we will use the same thing how about that 16th and 2 sixths okay
okay who can tell me what junhong did michael what did junhong do
okay so we can see that he go 4 times 6 equals 24 and i may i do one times 6 equals 64 times 4 equals 242 times 4 makes 8 so can you tell me what he is trying to do here he is drawing a line
okay you are telling me what he did but can you tell me what is his strategy why is he doing that yeah but why is he doing all that work michelle to make the both denominator same
0 so he is looking for the same denominator then he can compare just the numerator okay so that is one strategy to find a common denominator so the same denominator does that make sense yeah that he can just focus on the numerator so another strategy is the common denominator good okay any questions for junhong no
okay so what is anybody else with a different strategy
0 why do not the 3 of us kind of explain what we did all right so you have 14th and again the importance of trying to draw the shape the same
the same the whole is about the same size so it is easier to see so well and tiffany and andrew and i we also used a similar actually the same strategy so what do we focus on when you have something like this what is another way to focus on yeah how many is left focus on the leftover portion
so here i have 3 fourths left over and here i have 4 sixths left over okay and then what
okay so why one wei xin or anyone else she does not just put the 2 of them . all right anyone no okay so let us think about this one i know we are running out of time so we have 3 fourths left over
this one has 4 sixths left over so we talk about the relationship with other fractions so here i know they are going to be upset that i used green but i am going to fill this in i know this is half and this is half what is left over this is the same thing so the one thing that is different that is left is that one whole so here not one whole sorry this is 16th this is 14th left over
now i can compare 14th and 16th because i took care of the half already right they both i took care of that so i do not have to worry about that because they are exactly the same then i have 16th and 14th left now because the numerator is the same then we can go back and think about well one out of 4 pieces one out of 6 pieces 14th must be bigger right now then i know that 3 fourths is bigger than 4 sixths
so then we go back to that idea the more i ate the less i have left over the less i eat the more i have left over so because i have more left over then that means that i must eat less so this must be smaller and since here i have less left over so this must be bigger does that make sense
so again thinking about using the relationship you have the fractions have amongst each other bringing out the half then look at the next part does that make sense okay okay so tomorrow we will have i think we should talk a little bit about more about this strategy so another strategy is looking at the left overs i like calling them left overs they are like food so they are like left overs all right so and the relationship between one fraction to another to help us to figure things out use what you know
we always say use what you know to help you solve what you do not know okay any question on this no so tomorrow we will talk a little bit more about that we will play another probably another round of fraction cards for those of you who left your fraction cards at home please bring them back tomorrow all right any question no no the 4 strategies we talk about is crisscross you are working on the number line finding the common denominators and focusing on the left overs
i think we are pretty most of us are pretty comfortable using the crisscross i think we should develop focus a little bit more on the other 3 and especially i love this one where we actually the more you are able to manipulate the numbers and the fraction the easier that means that your understanding of fraction is even deeper the number line the number line and you might find one that is most efficient for you any question no we did not get a chance to talk about the equivalent fraction so we will continue that conversation tomorrow
we will start that conversation tomorrow please share it so your homework for tonight is page 35 which is larger which is larger 2 thirds or 32s use word to rehab sorry use words and picture to explain your answer earlier michelle and amy were trying to tell me something that is equivalent and then amy was like may i draw it and once they drew it out they figured out the answer so when you are in doubt draw it out okay any question on your homework no
