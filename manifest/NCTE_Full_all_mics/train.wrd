all right everyone should have their mountain math sheets out
where is your mountain math sheet you do not have one you were in here yesterday morning when we went over the things on the board correct
it soleil just sit in your seat sweetheart sit in your seat
all right so mountain math this week yesterday we had an opportunity to go over number one and i am glad we did because we got an opportunity to look at partial product again yesterday and i got a chance to see that some of you guys still need that review
good we also looked at number 2 yesterday and we talked about the 2 systems of measurement that we use called customary and metric customary and metric system
me pints would fall under which system what is the system that we primarily use here in the states good now the question there says which item would most likely have this weight or capacity when we are trying to figure out when you hear pint are you thinking about weight or are you thinking about capacity
capacity which is how much a seat can hold which is measured in cups pints quarts ounces gallons very very good
good it is not how much it is how much it can hold but what is it holding when you are talking about capacity what is it holding liquid liquid very very good
now let us look at number 3 number 3 is a review of place value okay and what we are trying to do quick review you are trying to see or you are going to tell me the number 2 or the digit 2 in each one of these numbers you are going to tell me the place value so read the 1st number for me
mackenzie 124784531 531 very good place which place it do not give me the value of it tell me which place it is in
say tell me what you said what is the place value meaning which place is it in place is it in the 100s place it is in the 10s place say it loud it is in the 10000000s it is in the 10000000s place
now knowing that it is in the 10000000s place what is the value of that 2 number morris read the next number for me the next number is .
to 314728 314728 what is the place value of the 210s place it is in the 10s place now that 2 being in the 10s place what is the value of that 2
20 very very good the next number casey 682986 682986 what is the place value of the 2 place what is the value of that 2 in the 1000s place 2000 very good me 2734879 say it again
2734879 very good you just left out the 1000 the 1st time place the 2 being in the 1000000s place what is the value of that 2 job put your mountain math away and get out your calendar math
as soon as you get over there plop down get started
i i put it to start calendar today you want to start calendar today okay back here ladies come on did you do calendar at your old school no
today okay i am going to give you a 2nd hold on shh i am giving you guys a 2nd here soleil all right i am going to go ahead and let adam get us started
adam the fraction to decibels the fraction could be 109 over 180 the fraction could be what 109 over 180 does this model 109 over 180 do we have 180 total pieces here
i got 200 units you could you are going to have to end up having 200 units okay but if you look at this let us put it in the form of a mixed number 1st
you would divide it chance you would add 100 to 9 9 and it leaves the denominator the same okay what you would end up doing is you would do 100 times the one
what 109 109 and he said you leave your denominator the same you leave your denominator the same can you also do 0 no you can not can i also do what 100 we do not want to go backwards just go the way the operation tells you to go
because you will not always have a one as your whole number okay alright nor will you always have 100 as your denominator okay alright now is there another way that you could write this one and 9 hundredths priyasi you want to come up here and show me
there very very good like when you see that what do you think of
dollar 100 100 so knowing that this can also be thought of as one.09 what is the place value of the 9 9 if there are 100 pennies in a dollar what is the place value of the 9
joshua hundredths it is in the hundredths place good today is the 30th day of school not the 30th day of school but it is the 30th day of january i did the same thing yesterday ms
ms lee classify that number for me even how do we know when a number is even davis can you look in the ones place if it is 0 2 4 6 8
okay yeah very very good equal groups can go into it 2 if it can be divided by 2
2 in division you have your dividend 30 divided by 2 items correct mackenzie your divisor is your total number of groups what groups groups perfect but you just said it a different way good now she also said that 30 was composite
who can provide me evidence to support 30 being composite
good now who can list the factors for 30 for me on the board up there
here which fraction is not not in simplest form ms lee 3 which one is not in simplest form
3 put your hands down for a 2nd i have a quick question you know how i am always telling you guys when you are doing problem solving and you are reading problems you got to make sure you understand the vocabulary 1st what does this mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form i know ms lee i know i know what does that mean
the greatest common factors that they have in common are what good so the question asks which fraction is not in its simplest form and you got to tell me how you know ms
lee elijah 9 twelfths he says 9 twelfths is not in its simplest form because if you could divide it by 3 i would give you 3 fourths excellent excellent job
he gave me an answer he gave me evidence to support his answer again hit the bucket alright josh morris i noticed a pattern on the calendar okay what pattern do you notice they are all the same fractions they are just rotated around they are all the same fractions but they are just rotating and we saw this at the beginning of the month
how you have a 12th a 4th a 3rd then a half itself a 12th a 4th a 3rd and a half good all right but you are just saying that it rotates it is like the shaded area is rotating around the circle
in and when i say direction is it going clockwise or is it going counterclockwise ms lee casey you look at a clock
is it going do your hands go this way to the right ms lee yeah it is going tuesday and then look at saturday and it is going that way
here if you go from tuesday to wednesday 0 yeah i thought you meant like the same fractions no but wait a minute you may have discovered something else what do you mean when you say the same fractions come up here and show me because i say it is going clockwise all right
like that one is right there and so then that one is moving counterclockwise and then this one is also moving counterclockwise okay here to here to here okay so what you were looking at is the same fractions from one let us write those numbers down
one 5 9 13 17 21 25 and 29 what i would have to agree with you and maybe the way i said it confused you guys
but if you are looking at the same fraction if you are looking at a 12th here and a 12th here and a 12th here it does look like it is going counterclockwise but what i was talking about is i was saying if you are going from a 12th to a 4th from a 4th to a 3rd from a 3rd to a 12th i am sorry to a half
see so very very good and thank you for explaining that you put up a column between 5 and 9 okay there we go here wait a minute wait wait wait these are all of your numbers and i think i left off i got them all up there all of your numbers that have a 12th shaded in
numbers what do they have in common they are all odd numbers what does it mean for a number to be odd
way i think because most odd numbers they can not be divided divided by what by even numbers i mean into even groups well 25 can not so can 21 21 so can 9 most odd numbers no
help him out because he is on the right track but help him out it does not have like a multiple or something like i can not do it
0 yeah i do not know chris it can not be divided by 2
2 remember when we showed here your divisor what you are dividing by tyrese your divisor when it is 2 if you have an odd number 2 will not the number that you have 25 cannot be split evenly into 2 groups missus lee and tyrese and we are trying to share 25 chocolate chip cookies guess what
you simply because each of you gets 12.5 i will not split the half that but evenly but you know what you can say 12.5 but that half is that half a whole number no
not so that is why this would not be considered an even number very good very good more everybody to your seat and we are going to look at what ife did
on go to your bathroom sweetie and wash your hands no do not touch anything come on
clipboards back aziz he just sneezed aziz sneezed in 321 okay ife came up here and we were classifying the number 30 and someone said that 30 was a composite number so ife tell us what you did
i did the multiple i mean the factors for 30 and what equals 30 if you multiply those 2 factors together and then i listed the factors very good
right now we want to make sure that we try to always list the factors in order correct out so put your hands down for a 2nd so she started off good right here 30 okay she did one times 30 but we determined that 30 was an even number so if you know that 30 is an even number you know that 30 can be divided evenly into 2 groups
so pretty much what i just said is that 30 divided by 2 gives you a number without a remainder or your quotient without a remainder so what number or what 2 factors should i have right here
group 5 well if i put 5 in each group you all remember how to do partial quotient yeah ms lee all right if i have partial quotient . yes help me out here you can go ahead and put 5 and you say 5 times 2 will give you what 1010 how many do i have left
20 then you do 0 i still have 20 20 of that 20 ife how many can i put in each group group okay so i would say 10 times 2 would give me 20
you said times okay so what goes here 0 i add up these numbers here and what do i get
1515 is our partial quotient all right wait a minute we have not gotten there yet this that was a good review right there though okay so we have 2 times 15 3 times 10
yes 6 this is just inverse good what property is that representing commutes to property no 9
one there should be a 2 here 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 so what she was missing over here you had your 30 over here sweetheart 15 okay so very very good
night on yesterday how do we add and subtract mixed numbers review okay it is a review put your hand down for a 2nd 0 this is a review
review and what i want you all to do without saying anything i just want you to check your answers right now do everyone should be checking their work give it to me
thank you everyone should be checking their homework where is your homework ms lee you are getting in front of screen yeah i will move it down
i know just turn away all right
you have to answer the question okay so what fraction of a dollar does she have yeah you could have written 3 fourths but so that i know that you understand and you gave me a clear cut solution i would have said 3 fourths of a dollar now is there any way that you could have shown or modeled this
any way you could have modeled it or any equation that you could have you know written to represent it i do not know mackenzie you could have drawn a rectangle come show me
down you could have drawn a rectangle huh split it into 44 groups huh i mean colored in 3 very very good 3 quarters and a dollar very very good yes
could you have also done it ¢75 over a dollar yeah ¢75 over a dollar yes you could have that is what i did 3 quarters and hillary finds 3 quarters ¢75 what fraction of a dollar does she have same but how are they the same how do i get from this to this
dollar huh and 75 that is 25 75 that is 3 quarters and a 100 is 4 so 75 is 3 because 75 is 3 quarters and a 100 that is 4 quarters so it is 4 75 is 3 quarters it is equivalent to 3 quarters
good now how could i have went from here to here what i would have divided by 43 over 3 what would be my greatest common factor between 75 and 100
25 25 that is all you got to do is slow down 25 over 25 and i would have gotten 3 fourths 3 fourths is just my answer in what form very very good did i have questions about any of the other problems here any other questions upton on number 8 i got d
number 8 he got d here the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13
number it is both who got it right answer i would have taken what they said here and i would have tried it out with each one okay i would have tried it out with each one
minute the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number even everybody be quiet because the last number . now you see why it does not work
it it is an odd number i was thinking that like i did not look at the odd number example so then i started with the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than that one it the sum of the digits of a 3 digit number digits the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13
so the 1st thing i would have done is i would have actually added all these up to see if they were 13 plus the sum of the digits and this one did not equal 13 so we crossed that one off 0 so this one did not equal 13 and it was even d okay very very good hunter when i 1st i did it 2 times
huh i 1st did i read the 4 less part huh i thought 6 was a for some reason huh and because i did not read the whole thing that is why we have to read guys we have to read davis i am going to write about it
it i did i added 4 and 2 fourths +one and 3 fourths we got 5 and 5 fourths but 5 fourths is not proper fractions so i divided 5 fourths 5 fourths divided by 4 and got one over 14th because after i divided i subtracted 4 -5 huh now give me one denominator and added it to 5 and got 6 and 14th very good
job my mom taught me how to do it on the back very very good i want we are going to stop homework right now
and i want you all to open up your composition books okay and i actually want you to go ahead and just turn to the title page or the table of contents and in your table of contents you will just use a sheet of notebook paper sweetheart in your table of contents i want you to go ahead and write today is date january 30 2013
and i want you to write we will write addition and subtraction mixed number review
all right i want you all to number your paper from one to 27 problem act like you have fraction you are going to have fraction problems but you are going to have answers so you do one and you do a space 4 yeah like 2 spaces spaces thank you yeah just space it out and go one to 27
you can actually do 2 columns 5 on that front
yet go to the back if you have to
or the next page a lot of extra number 6
said did you get one track 27 yeah i have got number 27 now everybody has an index card on their desk okay what you guys are going to do is you are going to actually locate the number on your card
this i am going to show you all where the number is located the number is located in the top left hand corner corner and you are going to write that problem down by the number and you are going to solve it but you guys get a chance to start moving around in the classroom after you solve the number on your card you go trade with a friend you solve the next number and you trade with someone else
you solve that one and you trade with someone else until i call time yes all right we are going to start in one minute we are going to start in one minute and actually it is going to be more like 45 seconds
and you are going to start with your problem and then you are going to get a chance to no running just walk okay what do i have i am not telling you just work at your own pace
rush make sure you do the ones that you have correctly can you just write the answer no i want the problem and the answer and it is okay to trade card you just trade after you solve that problem
you just keep trading you may begin
pay attention to the operations because it is mixed review you i will trade with you
0 let me see what we are writing all right so you have 5 and 3 fifths 0 you did it on 12
okay go ahead and write get up and move girl move your bottom move your bottom you need somebody to trade with i would love to trade with you there you go
you need somebody to trade with there you go you want to trade with me
does that make sense okay very good okay let me get number 25
where is your pencil so you had 7 and 3 fifths -one and 3 fifths 6 and 0 fifths well if you do not have if 3 fifths -3 fifths is 0 what should what should this be
6 very good there is no 0 fifths okay well you could have no fifths depending on what the question asks but when you write if you are doing just straight computation like this you would see that 3 fifths and 3 fifths when you subtract 3 fifths and 3 fifths that cancels that out and you end up with 7 -one and you get what
a difference of 6 okay 5 sure like so
it we are going to try it with somebody else okay go try it with somebody else you tried it with me twice okay let us see what you are doing here see we are both small so i can see you
see all right let me see what you are doing okay good job simplify okay 0 here you did not simplify you just provided an equivalent fraction now what could you have done here 4 and 6 tenths yeah you can simplify that
now show me how you would simplify the fraction part of that mixed number very good which is equivalent to 4 and 6 tenths very good 6 my have you done that one yet
no who do i need to find 0 me 0 my let us try it again i do not know how to do it you done 21 no all righty i do not know how to get it then whatever you have i have done 5 and 6 tenths let us look at this one
yes and so what do you end up getting 6 and 13rd i mean 15th very good girl girl girl girl stop you have been trading with me a lot
18 can i trade i already did number 18
27 the last person i saw had good number one was chris i have number one the last person i saw had everyone is number one
no 5 i have 5 have you had let me see if i have any low numbers on here you have had number 5 you have had number 17 5 you have had . yeah you have not had 15 go i do not know what you had because you do not have your answer 32
one freeze i want everyone to go back it is okay everyone to your seat and i want you to finish up that last problem sorry on everyone to your seat and finish up the last problem that you are working on
it huh you had your chance yes go to your seat
see how good you did okay you guys ready ready yes all right shh check your work you see it mackenzie close my door
i provided you the simplest form i converted any improper fractions to mixed numbers
work can you go back shh
done yes i just wanted you guys to have a wide variety
yes i want everybody to put your head on your desk down down
i do not want to see your eyes heads down do not want to see your eyes eyes i want you to raise your hand if you need my help
hands down i want you to specific raise your hand if you do not understand how to convert an improper to a mixed number
hands down raise your hand if you need help simplifying fractions
if you understand all of it stand up and say i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this all right everybody sit down i got this sit down chris do not ruin it hands down for homework tonight we are going to come back
hand and what i want you all to do is still problem solving because tomorrow you get an opportunity to go back and look at your chapter 15 test
okay and you are going to be practicing adding like fractions meaning like denominators 15 one and on the back you are going to be subtracting like fractions meaning like denominators 15.2 show all of your work and guys number 9 on here you need to answer that
okay give me a clear well thought out response understand yes madam understand yes madam now antonella did something that i thought was very smart she took her homework from last night and she glued it into her composition book i would like for you all to go ahead and do that while i pass out your homework
and once you are done you can go ahead and take a restroom break and when you come to the door bring me the index cards glue it in
hold on a 2nd let me pass these out okay yeah you do not have a composition book yet
you just got here so i am going to have to send your mom another send her a supply list okay i know they gave her one in the office but i need to email her if you did not get homework raise your hand
i did not tell anyone to open my door
out where is your mountain math sheet
one you were in here yesterday morning when we went over the things on the board correct so you should have had one of these
it soleil just sit in your seat sweetheart sit in your seat
all right so mountain math this week yesterday we had an opportunity to go over number one and i am glad we did because we got an opportunity to look at partial product again yesterday and i got a chance to see that some of you guys still need that review
good we also looked at number 2 yesterday and we talked about the 2 systems of measurement that we use called customary and metric customary and metric system
system what is the system that we primarily use here in the states good now the question there says which item would most likely have this weight or capacity when we are trying to figure out when you hear pint are you thinking about weight or are you thinking about capacity
capacity which is how much a seat can hold which is measured in cups pints quarts ounces gallons very very good good it is not how much it is how much it can hold but what is it holding when you are talking about capacity
holding liquid liquid very very good now let us look at number 3 number 3 is a review of place value okay and what we are trying to do quick review you are trying to see or you are going to tell me the number 2 or the digit 2 in each one of these numbers you are going to tell me the place value
me mackenzie 124784531 531 very good place which place i know it do not give me the value of it tell me which place it is in
say tell me what you said what is the place value meaning which place is it in place is it in the 100s place it is in the 10s place say it loud it is in the 10000000s it is in the 10000000s place
now knowing that it is in the 10000000s place what is the value of that 2 number morris read the next number for me the next number is .
to 314728 314728 what is the place value of the 210s place it is in the 10s place now that 2 being in the 10s place what is the value of that 2
casey 682986 682986 what is the place value of the 2 me 2734879 say it again
2734879 very good you just left out the 1000 the 1st time okay what is the place value of the 2 place the 2 being in the 1000000s place what is the value of that 2 job put your mountain math away and get out your calendar math
as soon as you get over there plop down get started
sir i i put it to start calendar today you want to start calendar today on did you do calendar at your old school
here i do not have time for this soleil sweetie you do not i do not have time for this okay so what you are going to have to do is get a sheet of notebook paper and come on back because you got to put your papers where they belong
organized you got to be able to transition floor monsey make sure you can see what is going on so turn around
on shh i am giving you guys a 2nd here soleil all right i am going to go ahead and let adam get us started
adam the fraction to decibels the fraction could be 109 over 180 the fraction could be what 109 over 180 does this model 109 over 180 do we have 180 total pieces here
i got 200 units you could you are going to have to end up having 200 units okay but if you look at this let us put it in the form of a mixed number 1st
chance you would add 100 to 9 9 and it leaves the denominator the same okay what you would end up doing is you would do 100 times the one
what 109 109 and he said you leave your denominator the same 100 i mean one times 9 equals 9 +100 and one times 100 we do not want to go backwards just go the way the operation tells you to go
because you will not always have a one as your whole number okay alright nor will you always have 100 as your denominator okay alright now is there another way that you could write this one and 9 hundredths priyasi you want to come up here and show me
there very very good one and 9 hundredths what does this look like of yes you see a decimal
he says he thinks of a one.09 100 100 so knowing that this can also be thought of as one.09 what is the place value of the 9 what is the value of the 9
if there are 100 pennies in a dollar what is the place value of the 9 joshua hundredths it is in the hundredths place
school not the 30th day of school but it is the 30th day of january me okay so 1st she said it was even even how do we know when a number is even
davis can you look in the ones place if it is 0 2 4 6 8 have if it can be divided by 2 2 in division you have your dividend 30 divided by 2
your dividend is your total number of items correct mackenzie your divisor is your total number of groups what groups groups perfect but you just said it a different way good now she also said that 30 was composite who can provide me evidence to support 30 being composite
number what is a composite number
good now who can list the factors for 30 for me on the board up there
here which fraction is not not in simplest form ms lee 3 form 3 put your hands down for a 2nd i have a quick question
you know how i am always telling you guys when you are doing problem solving and you are reading problems you got to make sure you understand the vocabulary 1st what does this mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form i know ms lee i know i know what does that mean
the greatest common factors that they have in common are what good so the question asks which fraction is not in its simplest form
elijah 9 twelfths he says 9 twelfths is not in its simplest form because if you could divide it by 3 i would give you 3 fourths excellent excellent job he gave me an answer he gave me evidence to support his answer i did not have to ask you again
bucket alright josh morris i noticed a pattern on the calendar okay what pattern do you notice they are all the same fractions they are just rotated around they are all the same fractions but they are just rotating month how you have a 12th a 4th a 3rd then a half
itself a 12th a 4th a 3rd and a half good all right but you are just saying that it rotates it is like the shaded area is rotating around the circle
in and when i say direction is it going clockwise or is it going counterclockwise ms lee casey you look at a clock
is it going do your hands go this way to the right lee yeah it is going tuesday and then look at saturday and it is going that way look here
if you go from tuesday to wednesday 0 yeah i thought you meant like the same fractions no but wait a minute me because i say it is going clockwise all right
like that one is right there and so then that one is moving counterclockwise and then this one is also moving counterclockwise okay here to here to here okay so what you were looking at is the same fractions from one let us write those numbers down
one 5 9 13 17 21 25 and 29 what i would have to agree with you and maybe the way i said it confused you guys
but if you are looking at the same fraction if you are looking at a 12th here and a 12th here and a 12th here it does look like it is going counterclockwise but what i was talking about is i was saying if you are going from a 12th to a 4th from a 4th to a 3rd from a 3rd to a 12th i am sorry to a half
see so very very good and thank you for explaining that you put up a column between 5 and 9 okay there we go there all of your numbers that have a 12th shaded in
common they are all odd numbers odd what does it mean for a number to be odd
way i think because most odd numbers they can not be divided what by even numbers i mean into even groups well 25 can not so can 21
21 so can 9 most odd numbers no help him out because he is on the right track but help him out it does not have like a multiple or something like i can not do it
0 yeah i do not know chris it can not be divided by 2 2 remember when we showed here your divisor what you are dividing by tyrese
2 if you have an odd number 2 will not the number that you have 25 cannot be split evenly into 2 groups missus lee and tyrese and we are trying to share 25 chocolate chip cookies guess what
because each of you gets 12.5 i will not split the half that but evenly but you know what you can say 12.5 but that half is that half a whole number
not so that is why this would not be considered an even number good now i am going to say one more everybody to your seat and we are going to look at what ife did
on clipboards back aziz he just sneezed aziz sneezed in 32
one okay ife came up here and we were classifying the number 30 and someone said that 30 was a composite number
did i did the multiple i mean the factors for 30 and what equals 30 if you multiply those 2 factors together and then i listed the factors very good
right now we want to make sure that we try to always list the factors in order correct 30 okay she did one times 30 but we determined that 30 was an even number so if you know that 30 is an even number you know that 30 can be divided evenly into 2 groups
so pretty much what i just said is that 30 divided by 2 gives you a number without a remainder or your quotient without a remainder so what number or what 2 factors should i have right here lee give us some time
group 5 well if i put 5 in each group you all remember how to do partial quotient yeah ms right if i have partial quotient . yes help me out here you can go ahead and put 5 and you say 5 times 2 will give you what 1010 how many do i have left
20 then you do 20 20 of that 20 ife how many can i put in each group group okay so i would say 10 times 2 would give me 20
you said times okay so what goes here 0 i add up these numbers here and what do i get
1515 is our partial quotient all right wait a minute we have not gotten there yet this that was a good review right there though okay so we have 2 times 15 3 times 10
6 this is just inverse no 9 no
that so she has one there should be a 2 here 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 so what she was missing over here you had your 30 over here sweetheart 15 okay so very very good
night on yesterday how do we add and subtract mixed numbers review okay it is a review 2nd 0 this is a review
review and what i want you all to do without saying anything i just want you to check your answers right now do everyone should be checking their work
me thank you everyone should be checking their homework ms lee you are getting in front of screen yeah i will move it down
away all right so john had a question his hand popped up 1st
you have to answer the question okay so what fraction of a dollar does she have yeah you could have written 3 fourths but so that i know that you understand and you gave me a clear cut solution i would have said 3 fourths of a dollar now is there any way that you could have shown or modeled this
any way you could have modeled it or any equation that you could have you know written to represent it i do not know mackenzie you could have drawn a rectangle come show me
down you could have drawn a rectangle huh split it into 44 groups huh i mean colored in 3 very very good
yes could you have also done it ¢75 over a dollar yeah ¢75 over a dollar yes you could have that is what i did 3 quarters and hillary finds 3 quarters ¢75 what fraction of a dollar does she have
this because there is 4 quarters to a dollar huh and 75 that is 25 75 that is 3 quarters and a 100 is 4 so 75 is 3 because 75 is 3 quarters and a 100 that is 4 quarters so it is 4 75 is 3 quarters
good now how could i have went from here to here what i would have divided by 43 over 3 what would be my greatest common factor between 75 and 100 25 25 that is all you got to do is slow down
25 over 25 and i would have gotten 3 fourths 3 fourths is just my answer in what good did i have questions about any of the other problems here
any other questions upton on number 8 i got d here the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13
rest addition addition okay the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place
and 3 more than the one is digit number it is both right i want to tell you how i would have gotten this answer i would have taken what they said here and i would have tried it out with each one okay
one but wait a minute the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number what even how do we know that d is even quiet because the last number . now you see why it does not work
number i was thinking that like i did not look at the odd number example so then i started with the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than that one yes but you have to read all of it the sum of the digits of a 3 digit number digits the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13
so the 1st thing i would have done is i would have actually added all these up to see if they were 13 digits and this one did not equal 13 so we crossed that one off 0 so this one did not equal 13 and it was even d okay very very good
it i did i added 4 and 2 fourths +one and 3 fourths we got 5 and 5 fourths but 5 fourths is not proper fractions so i divided 5 fourths 5 fourths divided by 4 and got one over 14th because after i divided i subtracted 4 -5 huh now give me one i know and get the 4 that is my denominator and added it to 5 and got 6 and 14th very good did you get b for 7 yes excellent excellent job
my mom taught me how to do it on the back very very good now and i want you all to open up your composition books okay and i actually want you to go ahead and just turn to the title page or the table of contents and in your table of contents you will just use a sheet of notebook paper sweetheart
in your table of contents i want you to go ahead and write today is date january 30 2013 and i want you to write we will write addition and subtraction mixed number review
now you guys know the main reason that we are doing this is because you know things are moving so fast i just want to make sure you understand okay and so what is going to happen is let me stop for a 2nd and let you guys get organized
all right i want you all to number your paper from one to 27 fraction you are going to have fraction problems but you are going to have answers so you do one and you do a space
4 yeah like 2 spaces 27 you can actually do 2 columns 5 on that front
desk do not do anything to it yet
page a lot of extra 6 27 that is what i said
one 27 27 stay on track 27 now everybody has an index card on their desk okay what you guys are going to do is you are going to actually locate the number on your card what number is this i am going to show you all where the number is located
the number is located in the top left hand corner corner and you are going to write that problem down by the number and you are going to solve it but you guys get a chance to start moving around in the classroom after you solve the number on your card you go trade with a friend you solve the next number and you trade with someone else
you solve that one and you trade with someone else until i call time minute we are going to start in one minute and actually it is going to be more like 45 seconds and you are going to start with your problem
and then you are going to get a chance to no running just walk okay what do i have i am not telling you
correctly can you just write the answer no i want the problem and the answer card you just trade after you solve that problem
trading you may begin
pay attention to the operations because it is mixed review
right so you have 5 and 3 fifths 0 you did it on 12 okay go ahead and write get up and move girl
you need somebody to trade with there you go me there you go
okay let us see how we are doing over here okay let me check you out you are doing a great job
55 and 4 fourths 4 fourths equals what one whole so could not you go ahead and write your answer as 5 and 4 fourths equals if it is 6 wholes very very good answer okay instead of keeping it that way
good okay let me get number 25
where is your pencil so you had 7 and 3 fifths -one and 3 fifths 6 and 0 fifths well if you do not have if 3 fifths -3 fifths is 0 what should what should this be
good there is no 0 fifths okay well you could have no fifths depending on what the question asks but when you write if you are doing just straight computation like this you would see that 3 fifths and 3 fifths when you subtract 3 fifths and 3 fifths that cancels that out and you end up with 7 -one and you get what
a difference of 6 okay 5 sure like so yes because i had 27 and i did not know you had to do the same number what do you mean
for example if i if i if i had 27 and i did not know you i absolutely could . 0 you do not worry about that sweetheart you just keep working okay me 0 you got it right you are okay you just keep working
okay thank you all very much
much thank you all very much much you dropped some paper it we are going to try it with somebody else okay go try it with somebody else
here okay i am going to see we are both small so i can see you see all right let me see what you are doing okay good job simplify okay 0 here you did not simplify
fraction now what could you have done here that now show me how you would simplify the fraction part of that mixed number
very good which is equivalent to 4 and 6 tenths very good 6 no who do i need to find 0 me 0 my let us try it again i do not know how to do it
then whatever you have i have done 5 and 6 tenths let us look at this one
bit let me see your hands okay all right right here you have got 5 and 6 tenths how would you convert the fraction part of that to a proper fraction or a mixed number because you would invert an improper to a mixed number so i am going to come down here with your answers okay and you have got 5 and 6 tenths do you remember how to convert an improper to a mixed do not you need to write it
me 12345678 i do not know but i do not want them to make us have to stop davis one and 15th one and a 5th so if you got one and a 5th as your mixed number for this that cancels this out right
so you have 5 wholes and one and a 5th what do you need to do to those 2 to make your answer do you add half of this one and then add this one yes and so what do you end up getting
6 and 13rd i mean 15th very good girl girl girl girl stop you have been trading with me a lot
18 can i trade i already did number 18 you can i trade with you it i got number 27 i have number 27
the last person i saw had good number one was chris i have number one the last person i saw had everyone is number one no 5 i have 5 have you had let me see if i have any low numbers on here you have had number 5 you have had number 17
19 you have had 5 you have had . yeah you have not had 15 there you go i do not know what you had because you do not have your answer 321 freeze i want everyone to go back
it is okay everyone to your seat and i want you to finish up that last problem on everyone to your seat and finish up the last problem that you are working on huh you had your chance yes go to your seat
in 321 mouths are off and everyone is seated
seated now i am going to put up some of the answers and i want you to check your work see how good you did okay you guys ready
ready yes all right shh check your work you see it mackenzie close my door
you will notice my answers i provided you the simplest form i converted any improper fractions to mixed numbers
variety how did we do
eyes do not want to see your eyes i want you to raise your hand if you need my help to i am going to be more specific
raise your hand if you do not understand how to convert an improper to a mixed number hands down raise your hand if you need help simplifying fractions
if you understand all of it stand up and say i got this this i got this i got this i got this i got this all right everybody sit down i got this sit down chris do not ruin it hands down for homework tonight we are going to come back
hand and what i want you all to do is still problem solving because tomorrow you get an opportunity to go back and look at your chapter 15 test
okay and you are going to be practicing adding like fractions meaning like denominators 15 one and on the back you are going to be subtracting like fractions meaning like denominators 15.2 show all of your work and guys number 9 on here you need to answer that
okay give me a clear well thought out response understand yes madam understand yes madam now antonella did something that i thought was very smart she took her homework from last night and she glued it into her composition book i would like for you all to go ahead and do that while i pass out your homework
and once you are done you can go ahead and take a restroom break cards glue it in
okay yeah you do not have a composition book yet here so i am going to have to send your mom another send her a supply list okay
i know they gave her one in the office but i need to email her if you did not get homework raise your hand
okay my math goals reader can you please read the math goals for today students will be able to compare decimals using graphic representation
excellent students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than . and and equal to one another nice okay so what do we know about decimals so far
friday what did you learn about decimals you can go back into your notes if you need to what did you learn about decimals or what do you know about decimals tan
decimal is the fraction that is small decimal is a fraction please class what else do you know about decimals ban
fraction is the number of the smaller so the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction if you have more zeros the smaller the fraction so the smaller the decimal good anything else tiffany what did you learn about decimals it is like money it is like money what do you mean
you what do you mean it is like money thinking we gave an example on friday about money can you talk about that what do you mean it is like money
what about it is like money exxon that the decimal you use it for money like the decimal you use it for money and other stuff so you are trying to help tiffany out okay tiffany i am coming back to you
money thank you we talked about it on friday do you remember the example we gave on friday i can not hear you
louder we talked about a quarter and how is that like a decimal dollar so it is a fraction of a dollar good and one more person tao
a decimal is like it represents a fraction and a short way of words so it is like a fraction and it is a short way of words
mean like it represents a fraction so you think it is a shorter way of writing a fraction right okay so who remembers this from friday this so decimal is a number with a decimal point in it
i think that is what you mean for money tiffany all the digits to the left of the decimal represents whole numbers 0 these are all whole numbers because they are to the left of the decimal
all the numbers to the right of the decimal represent the actual decimal the actual fractional piece so where is the decimal here in this number number 5200th good do not forget the 6 let us try to say the whole thing 6 and
and 6 and 52 what you said before 5252 what what okay let us try to put the whole thing together 6.526 and 52 okay by yourself
65200 we are missing something 65200th one more time
5 tenths 5 tenths when it is a 0 you will need to say 0
no 100th 100th very nice excellent so today we are going to be comparing decimals but 1st i want you to write down this number and what each place value is so the 2 is in the 1000s place
place the 6 in the 10s the 4 in the ones and then we have our decimal so the 5 is in the tenths place and the 7 is in the hundredths place now remember when you are saying your decimal numbers to cover your mouth because you may end up spitting on the person in front of you okay i want to make sure i hear that part
i will give you about 2 minutes to copy that down so we can move on
it if it is easier for you you can put 1000s on top of the 200s on top of the one whichever way is easier for you to remember
one more minute no sneezing bless you you got it ritchie let me see
so in your groups i have several numbers here you see where each number is underlined i want you to tell me what place is it in
minutes work as a group
group so far all i hear is tao trying to work with her group but i do not hear any other groups trying to work with each other not independently
it did we talk about this or did you just put this down on your notebook did you talk about it with hannah tee and magnolia so erase it
it can we talk about it
100 so this is why you guys need to have a discussion about it this is to help each other out okay wendy what about the next one
1000s wendy thinks this is the 1000s place let us have a discussion about this the decimal is here and .
it okay the decimal is right here yeah and the number is here so what place is this before decimal what place is this ones so this would be the it is right before the decimal right so what would this be
one what would this be ones did you tell me which one reaches in can we write together yeah we do i do not see it there i do not know how to do it where is the decimal am i pointing to it
what place comes before the decimal one be 10 what would this be
are any of you actually doing that yes or no so that means you are not following my directions okay so we need to work how
now so let us work together okay 2 more minutes to finish this up and then we are going to go over each one what do you think exxon do you agree with all your choices the 4 or the 6
no what do you think it is what do you think tee
so how is it possible that if i ask you to work together you all have different answers how is that possible tell hannah why you think it is the ones place tell her
ds all right let us go over this let us do the 1st one who can come up here and label what place the 6 is in
if you disagree thumbs down you think they agree with you thumbs up all right next one pass it to somebody else thumbs up if we agree with tan
else they do not have to have their hands raised it is more fun when they do not
embry are you trying to say the same place as exxon or a different place
place same place so you see how he spelled his all right thumbs up if we agree with glendy thumbs down if we disagree
place do not forget this side of the room the ones place thumbs up if you agree with tao
thumbs down if you disagree hang on let us see who agrees and who disagrees okay good come on tiffany look at that they are clapping for you and everything
alrighty thumbs up if we agree with tiffany that it is in the 100s place thumbs down if you disagree
one hannah can you say it a little bit louder 4 and 600s 4 and 600s sounds good to me
magnolia 6064 and 1818 tenths magnolia says 64 and 18 tenths
is 1818 what again 64 and 18 hundredths beautiful 64 and 18 hundredths and the next one glendy
4 and 6 hundredths what number is this 6 this 1616 what 100s let us try that again 4 and 16 hundredths 4 and 16 hundredths the next one tee
5 and 83 hundredths 5 and 83 hundredths and last but not least exxon 5 and 13 hundredths 5 and 13 hundredths i love it i love it alrighty so today we are going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another you are going to be using charts
i am going to give 2 to each group these charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another what does it mean to compare what do you think i mean when i mean to compare decimals
think about your goals for today your objective for today what do i want you to do with decimals i will wait because the witnesses seem a little distracted so i will ask my question again compare when you compare numbers what do you do
magnolia compare not quite exxon 10th she just said the same thing and i said not quite numbers magnolia can you read the goal again for a language objective
so i told everyone to start with decimals r s m greater than and equal to again what do you think i mean when i say compare decimals doing only tao knows
exxon fang what do you think i am going to be asking you to do listening students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than and equal to one another
doing i can not hear you compare the decimals what does it mean to compare question tee to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller or equal to another decimal right
decimals you are going to be seeing whether they are smaller bigger or equal to each other and i want you to use those charts to help you figure it out as a group alright does everyone have those charts okay so we are going to play a group war
and how this works is i am going to give you some time to think about it to think about the numbers by yourself and then you are going to share with your group what you are thinking leader this leader is going to share their thinking with the class
trick each group needs to be prepared to share because you never know which group is going to get called on alright and 2 groups will be getting called on which means you have to tell me whether you agree or disagree with each other okay so let me show you the practice this is a practice round
so i already pre selected these decimals so the decimals that you are comparing is 110th and 12 hundredths you want to tell me if 110th is less than greater than or equal to 12 hundredths you are going to think about it by yourself for 30 seconds 1st and then when i tell you to share your thoughts with your group that is when you are going to share with your group
okay and then i am going to have group one and group 2 see we do not have a 19
here right he is 3 so group one would be inspectors be we do not have a 17
15 tiffany is group alright so then inspectors will be talking 1st about what they think and then tiffany is group will be talking about if they agree or disagree with what fang said
go group one goes 1st and then group 2 will follow toes so at this point i want you to pick your leader for your group
me witnesses who is your leader exxon and detectives who is your leader ready so remember i am going to give you 30 seconds to think about it by yourself and then you are going to share your thinking with your leader
so your leader is going to take all the knowledge that you have given him plus or her plus their own and have a discussion about it ready okay so here is the 1st 2 cards so i want you to think about it 1st
maybe you want to color in 67 hundredths and color in 5 tenths to see which one is greater okay now i want you to discuss it as a group i will give you about one to 2 minutes to discuss it
you need to tell me why is it bigger why is it smaller why is it equal to the other number
yet did you guys use a chart to help figure it out
okay let us see which group is group one
let us see who is group 2
okay let us see who is up 1st group 2 thinking come on
we agree because we also think 6700 is bigger 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths natan said something interesting true is that true do you remember exxon is cake on friday that we cut it
cake we cut it into hundredths pieces were the pieces bigger no said i know what you meant but hundredths is not bigger than tenths it depends on the situation okay
you know what i mean okay and what do you guys think do you agree with these 2 groups that 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths tiffany you did a graphic representation it so on the charts they actually colored in the 5 tenths and the 6700 bigger exxon hundredths can you say the number
6700 so the 6700 is closer to a whole correct so therefore it is bigger round okay so this is 30 seconds of wait time
i put it right there it is like what question was it
say it again and then repeat after him i think the 1st time was too much for me okay share them with our groups now what we think i did not hear it
no i did not did you color in 5 tenths correctly is that a new one or is that the old one
and 4th 800s okay i thought you colored in the old one no okay let us see whose group won
let us do a different one
we do not have that okay are we ready let us see which group is up 1st group one you are up 1st i think . louder exxon wants to hear you
he is ready to fight i know exxon he loves to argue i think the 1400 is bigger than 4 tenths because 4 tenths is just 54 and 0 the 1300 is 40 and 40 is bigger than 4 if you add more 0 the number becomes 4
i respectfully disagree why do you respectfully disagree because if you they are the same because if you just put the 0 they will be the same and if you and if you like here it will be the same too
same tan he is talking to fang do you mind being quiet can you repeat that again because she kept talking because when you are going to do they are the same because they show the same representation if you are going to color it you have to color both of those 4 sides so they are the same
okay tiffany what do you think you agree or disagree who do you agree with i agree with group 2 you agree with group 2 now tiffany also colored in i like that tiffany keeps using graphic representations because it helps prove your point a little bit better she colored in 4 tenths right she also colored in 40 hundredths where do they stop
yes so 4 tenths is still 6 tenths away from a whole and 40 hundredths is 60 hundredths away from a whole so they are actually equal 2 alrighty and one more round
ready i told you exxon is going to aruge it is a hard one it is a hard one because we have not talked about thousandths yet
okay now discuss with your groups what you are thinking is this a little tricky part 2
wow what do you think i think it is closer to part 2 why
2 detectives you are up 1st what do you think can you speak louder tiffany we think it is part 2 because we think part 2 is what
2 what answer 00 i mean 220 .
2200 why think about what tao said because if you add a 0 to 200 still the 5 will be bigger than 0 200 200000s and this would be
225000 which one of those is bigger 225000 225000 is bigger than 220000 right so you are correct part 2 is bigger and i like the way that you guys thought about it also so you are just bringing me on to what i was going to explain to you so let us go back to these 2 decimals that we talked about earlier
sometimes you do not even need a graphic representation to help you figure out how to compare decimals the 1st thing you do is you line up your decimals so that they are one on top of the other compare then we look at our ones place what are the numbers in our ones place glendy and
can i compare that no that does not help me place and and what is the number in my tenths place no what about in the 100s place
magnolia 11 and compare yes or no bigger 7 or 5 ritchie 7 the 7 is bigger
than 5 so 27 hundredths is bigger than 25 hundredths okay so now what i want you to do is i want you to look at the back of the room board 37 hundredths and 4 tenths i want you to tell me if it is less than greater than or equal to in your notebooks by yourself
0.37 how do we say that number 37 hundredths hundredths good it is greater than 4 tenths and 4 hundredths and 4 hundredths it is greater than 0.37
you said 0.37 is greater than 4 tenths is that what you mean to say so you think this number is bigger than this number exxon i respectfully disagree because if you put the 7 to the 4 that will be bigger
mind i said that 4 hundredths is bigger than 0.37 you know what you said at 1st that 0.37 is bigger than 4 tenths day so you are correct
37 hundredths is smaller than 4 tenths you know what i saw when i came around bigger and she said 4 tenths is bigger because 4 is bigger than 3
alright so on your desks you have your multiplication cluster problem that you worked on this weekend for homework right
and we started this on friday i gave you a little introduction we did set a together and i think you got to work on set b is that true before we left class on friday okay who can talk to us about what multiplication cluster problems are problems what is it all about
problems so when i look at each set i see several problems and then a final
said so she thinks that they have something to do with the final multiplication problem in the list leslie do you want to add to that
the problem is that they gave you you have to choose 2 of them to help you with the final problem and did you find them to be helpful when you were solving them this weekend so was there something from the list that you could choose to help you solve the final problem at the bottom
list okay so you are given kind of a big challenging problem at the bottom of the list and those those related problem sets those clusters are the those clusters are there to help you break down the bigger problem okay and in past experience nancy we have had to create our own problems right we have had to make arrays and break those larger problems down on our own and be creative and think about how to do that
but in this case you do not necessarily have to be as creative to even give us a list of problems to choose from it okay so we did set a together but i want to show you an example of something that you will be working on this morning you are going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner example i have chosen set a since we already solved a together on friday
so what you are going to do is here is your list of directions i am going to give you and a partner a split and on that split is one of the sets on your sheet the only one that is not represented is a because i am doing a for you so i took a out of the possibilities
get that is why i asked you to be prepared over the weekend and come in with them all finished already you are just going to add a little bit of some work to that today okay so with the split a set that i give you you are going to solve each of the small more manageable problems in the cluster which you already have if you did all your homework so all you have to do is rewrite them on a slip of paper
okay then you are going to decide upon one or 2 problems to use to help you solve the final more challenging problem one or 2 okay you might choose one and then have to add something from your own thinking or there might be 2 in the list that will help you get right to the product of the final problem
so solve each of the small problems decide which ones that will help you to get the answer of the large one then this is new you are going to draw an open array that matches what you chose so whatever problems you chose to help you solve the final problem you are going to draw an array open array to help you visualize what this problem breaks down to look like okay
so we will not bother with drawing every single small square unit in the box because that helps us with smaller multiplication problems but when we get into the 100s we would spend a long time drawing all those small boxes that right michelle yes so here is an example of what this will look like after you draw your open array we are going to write a short little description of how you solved the final problem and why you used the problems that you used
so what were you thinking about when you chose each of the problems problems because mario you might work with chris and each of you are going to have the same set but you might want to use 2 problems and chris might want to use another 2 problems because he thinks about math in a different way he is making sense of breaking down the problems a little bit different
yeah so if you are working with a partner on the same set is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem yeah what do you think brian yeah do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses no you with me pay attention pay attention who can answer my question who me why because the 4 of us may think a different way
so even though you have the support of your partner and you can work together and help each other carlos you might decide that you want to use the 1st 2 problems and edna if you happen to be with him you might decide you want to use the 3rd problem but make up your own 2nd problem that is perfectly fine you are just there to support each other you do not have to do the exact same work because you each have your own way of thinking about things and you each already thought about them for homework anyway so it is up to you how you come to that conclusion of what to use
solving each one deciding on which problems to use open array short description of your thinking why you did what you did and how you got to the final answer okay and then you are going to put it all together on a little sheet that looks something like this
exactly so you are going to glue on the slip that i gave you do the solving this is where you write your little explanation and your open array can go down here if you mix it up a little bit and it does not all go in the same exact spot that is fine with me as long as you have those components the answers to the small problems the description of how you solved it and why you did it that way and your open array with the dimensions what are the dimensions of an open array
and one of those numbers will most likely be broken apart into smaller pieces okay so this is the small version to show you what yours will look like and then i just made kind of a gigantic version so you could see so i did set a 4 x 10 is 40 4 x 40 is 160 4 x 3 is 12 and 2 x 43 is 86
43 so what made sense for me when i was figuring out what to use to solve this was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 thought it was the 1st thought i had and the reason for that is i know that 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 gives me 4 x 43 because i took the 43 and i broke it into 2 smaller parts
i broke it into a 40 and a 43 right so this number sentence right here represents 40 groups of 4 which is this one +3 more groups of 4 which is this one gives me a total of 43 groups of 4 all i have to do is what add the what chris what is that word with the p
right i have to add the products from each of these and it gives me the product for the final one certainly but i only have to solve it in one way for this purpose madam yes on our paper do you have something that you can show why we use those to like get out of here yes please i would like for you to describe it as carefully as possible and put your thoughts down
why would you trade each other what are you going to like write on the paper what did you all learn in your notebook 1st once you have it all clear your arrays will be in your notebook right your big open array will be in your notebook the explanation will be in your notebook i will check it over and then i will give you the final poster paper no but i am talking about like you picked those 2 right yes
do we have to show on the paper like the bad and the fine posts and whatever yes and as you can see on this small paper i wrote explain your thinking in words and numbers so however you added it together whatever you multiplied explain why you did it that way and show your mathematical thinking does that answer your question yes
no brandon it looks like like that we are making progress yeah it is a little bit and you will have a final project and we may or may not finish this today we got started a little bit late with the camera issue but if we do not finish it today we will finish it up tomorrow but you should be able to get a significant amount of work done on it today okay and are there any questions
partners when i pick your partners i want you to come to me and i am going to give you each a slip
there is no gluing there is no final product until these are solved and the work is in your notebook when all of that is finished and you have checked it all over and you are sure that it represents what you want it to say or to be then you can have it checked with me and i will just be walking around and helping you out
you but we are going to be working at desks so whatever partner you get with you need to find a desk to work at you can not work on the same desk okay clear and like i always say your partner is your partner for now you are not getting married so it does not matter who you are working with use them in the best ability that you have right okay so let us start with leslie and brian
up get your slips one for each of you
aider 0 i hope sickness has not struck no allison and edna
josue alvin and edna catherine and mario
s and caroline and carlos you have 2 students absent and you are still even which is good carlos and caroline no
so the 50 is 10 x 5 so will this answer be 10 x 5
30 right okay so will this answer be 10 x this product so how will i get that product think about it
i will be back back up a little bit
so after you choose this one you choose this one this one right yes
71 all right so right here so the other problem is 70 x 5 right how is 70 x 5 related to this you already know the answer to 70 x 5
okay and then what is the difference between these 2 problems this is 70 x 5 and this is 5 +7
so how many more groups of 5 is this
it and you have to do it this way all right you are going to do it this way
you 58 x 2 6 this is 2 groups of 58 right how many groups of 58 are there 2
how many x do i have to make this array to match this problem do you guys agree with me on this 3 x 3 x total or 3 more x
why and i only have 2 here but there is 6 here if i were to make this 3 more x .
what do i do to all these to get to the answer so what i asked originally was what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
it just happened about how i need 2 more of those so i would say this is only 2 more x that would mean that i have 4 of them with all of them
amy what would you do with these 3 problems i agree why would you add them all i agree with you
yeah i agree with you
each one is just too big to carry right so why would you add them all
when i add up all of the units of 116 how many units of 58 do i have
6 how many units 6 so i add all of the unit 116 how many units of 58 do i have
do you have another nice thing you want to use this time okay we will do that all right so talk to me
so you need to put your own symbol on the list so 50 x okay so you start with what is on the list and then you decide to make your own problem which is 8 x 6
okay i like that you did that and that this is definitely going to get you to the answer which is 8 x 6
4 are you going to use your partner can you use karla to support you
you this means that you are a little bit behind because this work involving you has been done
pause it please excuse me
how is it going over here michelle which set did you get b yes okay and did you work together to solve the smaller problems yes
okay let us back up a little bit let me ask you this
what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
how many 2s are in 53 so how many times would you have to do 58 x 2 to get to 58 x 33 and let us maybe we can draw an array and see if that works out
all right so you and chris which sector did you choose 6
did you each get the same answer of 248
caroline this 50 x 6 is different than what you were doing here
here and then why did you start talking about a different problem there is it just a mistake what should this problem say is it 50 x 6 that you used or 50 x 2 that you used 50 x 2 is what you used you could have used 50 x 6 but you did not did you
and just re read your explanation to make sure it is exactly what you wanted to say
and this would be a 4 in your array
and as soon as you can help him with that i will give you the sheet of paper that is what we are waiting for go so 58 x 2 because i got the half of 6 and separated it into 3 pieces of 2
right thirds you took 6 and you split it
you can still talk about fractions if you want to but 2 is not half
somebody chose 58 x 2 and what did you do with it and i how many x did you do 58 x 2
2 is 13rd of 62 +2 +2 is 6 and your major your major long line of equations is right here this represents your array here is your picture here is your equation it is complicated it is it you know what
it is very complicated that is why we have lots of possibilities for what you said it is complex is this on time or no time a couple minutes a couple minutes i want to pause you
debrief is there any could i have one group one partnership that is close to being finished to come up and kind of talk about what they did hand i know you are not fully done with your poster and that is fine but could you could you still come up it you can pick one of your ways if you want you do not i know you went all out and did 2 strategies but if you want to just pick one way you can do that
you want to could you do that okay come on up on hold on pausing please caroline sit down all the way on the bottom i was working on set c
8 okay was there were there any other partners working on set c carefully think about whether you did it similarly differently or or what i used 32 x 8 okay so the main problem is 32 x 8 and you did 30 x 8
that because i needed to add 8 to what how many quarters of 8 do you need you did 30 you did 30 x 8 8 all right all eyes up here
let us tell barbie so your major problem is your final difficult problem is 32 x 8 8 what else would arlene need to do
have 32 so how many more groups of of 8 do you need 2 more groups of 8 right 8 you did the 30 x the 8 but you have to multiply all the parts of this number by this number so i still need the 2 x 8
what 240 and so how many more or how much more do you have to add with 2 x 8 yes did you say 16
i might have misheard you so what happens when you combine 30 groups of 8 +2 groups of 8 what do you get as a total 256 very good very good thank you
one more group one more partnership caroline do you want to come up up you have no problem speaking up right okay what was your set
what but what is the final problem carlos what is the final problem in set b what 58 x 6 b any other partners adrian are you paying attention are you paying attention it does not look like it
do i broke it into i broke it into 6 the 6 yeah so caroline took the and caroline and carlos took the 6 and they broke it into 32s 246 and then so what was 58 x 2
116116 and you had to do that how many times and we talked about a fraction because we are having some people are having a hard time with the word doubling doubling means multiplying something by 2 right but doubling is not the word we always use when it comes to multiplication it depends on what you are doing so 2 is not half of 6 right 6 is not 22
so these 2s are what fraction of 6 caroline 13rd 2 is 13rd of 6 x does that make sense okay usually we take the big problem and we make 2 smaller problems but with caroline she made it made more sense to her to do 3 problems because she used the 58 x 2 answer so all these groups of 2 add up to the 6 and the 58
of 30348 who else did group set b get 348 is your answer all right so we are going to pause on that
you were in here yesterday morning when we went over the things on the board correct so you should have had one of these
it soleil just sit in your seat sweetheart sit in your seat
all right so mountain math this week yesterday we had an opportunity to go over number one and i am glad we did because we got an opportunity to look at partial product again yesterday and i got a chance to see that some of you guys still need that review
good we also looked at number 2 yesterday and we talked about the 2 systems of measurement that we use called customary and metric customary and metric system
system what is the system that we primarily use here in the states good now the question there says which item would most likely have this weight or capacity when we are trying to figure out when you hear pint are you thinking about weight or are you thinking about capacity
capacity which is how much a seat can hold which is measured in cups pints quarts ounces gallons very very good good it is not how much it is how much it can hold but what is it holding when you are talking about capacity
what is it holding liquid liquid very very good now let us look at number 3 number 3 is a review of place value okay and what we are trying to do quick review you are trying to see or you are going to tell me the number 2 or the digit 2 in each one of these numbers you are going to tell me the place value
mackenzie 124784531 531 very good place which place i know it do not give me the value of it tell me which place it is in
say tell me what you said what is the place value meaning which place is it in place is it in the 100s place it is in the 10s place say it loud it is in the 10000000s it is in the 10000000s place
now knowing that it is in the 10000000s place what is the value of that 2 number morris read the next number for me the next number is .
to 314728 314728 what is the place value of the 210s place it is in the 10s place now that 2 being in the 10s place what is the value of that 2
casey 682986 682986 what is the place value of the 2 me 2734879 say it again
2734879 very good you just left out the 1000 the 1st time okay what is the place value of the 2 place the 2 being in the 1000000s place what is the value of that 2 job put your mountain math away and get out your calendar math
as soon as you get over there plop down get started
it is not a problem yes sir i i put it to start calendar today you want to start calendar today on did you do calendar at your old school
here i do not have time for this soleil sweetie this okay so what you are going to have to do is get a sheet of notebook paper and come on back because you got to put your papers where they belong
organized you got to be able to transition floor monsey make sure you can see what is going on so turn around
shh i am giving you guys a 2nd here soleil all right i am going to go ahead and let adam get us started
adam the fraction to decibels the fraction could be 109 over 180 the fraction could be what 109 over 180 does this model 109 over 180 do we have 180 total pieces here
i got 200 units you could you are going to have to end up having 200 units okay but if you look at this let us put it in the form of a mixed number 1st
chance you would add 100 to 9 9 and it leaves the denominator the same okay what you would end up doing is you would do 100 times the one
what 109 109 and he said you leave your denominator the same 100 i mean one times 9 equals 9 +100 and one times 100 we do not want to go backwards just go the way the operation tells you to go
because you will not always have a one as your whole number okay alright nor will you always have 100 as your denominator okay alright now is there another way that you could write this one and 9 hundredths priyasi you want to come up here and show me
there very very good one and 9 hundredths what does this look like of yes you see a decimal
he says he thinks of a one.09 100 100 so knowing that this can also be thought of as one.09 what is the place value of the 9 what is the value of the 9
if there are 100 pennies in a dollar what is the place value of the 9 joshua hundredths it is in the hundredths place
school not the 30th day of school but it is the 30th day of january me okay so 1st she said it was even even how do we know when a number is even
davis can you look in the ones place if it is 0 2 4 6 8 okay yeah very very good equal groups can go into it have if it can be divided by 2 2 in division you have your dividend 30 divided by 2
your dividend is your total number of items correct mackenzie your divisor is your total number of groups what groups groups perfect but you just said it a different way good now she also said that 30 was composite who can provide me evidence to support 30 being composite
number what is a composite number
good now who can list the factors for 30 for me on the board up there
here which fraction is not not in simplest form ms lee 3 which one is not in simplest form 3 put your hands down for a 2nd i have a quick question
you know how i am always telling you guys when you are doing problem solving and you are reading problems you got to make sure you understand the vocabulary 1st what does this mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form i know ms lee i know i know what does that mean
the greatest common factors that they have in common are what good so the question asks which fraction is not in its simplest form lee elijah
9 twelfths he says 9 twelfths is not in its simplest form because if you could divide it by 3 i would give you 3 fourths excellent excellent job answer he gave me evidence to support his answer i did not have to ask you again
bucket alright josh morris i noticed a pattern on the calendar okay what pattern do you notice they are all the same fractions they are just rotated around they are all the same fractions but they are just rotating and we saw this at the beginning of the month how you have a 12th a 4th a 3rd then a half
itself a 12th a 4th a 3rd and a half good all right but you are just saying that it rotates it is like the shaded area is rotating around the circle
in and when i say direction is it going clockwise or is it going counterclockwise lee casey you look at a clock
is it going do your hands go this way to the right lee yeah it is going tuesday and then look at saturday and it is going that way look here
if you go from tuesday to wednesday 0 yeah i thought you meant like the same fractions no but wait a minute you may have discovered something else what do you mean when you say the same fractions me because i say it is going clockwise all right
like that one is right there and so then that one is moving counterclockwise and then this one is also moving counterclockwise okay here to here to here okay so what you were looking at is the same fractions from one let us write those numbers down
one 5 9 13 17 21 25 and 29 what i would have to agree with you and maybe the way i said it confused you guys
but if you are looking at the same fraction if you are looking at a 12th here and a 12th here and a 12th here it does look like it is going counterclockwise but what i was talking about is i was saying if you are going from a 12th to a 4th from a 4th to a 3rd from a 3rd to a 12th i am sorry to a half
see so very very good and thank you for explaining that you put up a column between 5 and 9 okay there we go there all of your numbers that have a 12th shaded in
common they are all odd numbers odd what does it mean for a number to be odd
way i think because most odd numbers they can not be divided divided by what by even numbers i mean into even groups well 25 can not so can 21
21 so can 9 most odd numbers no help him out because he is on the right track but help him out it does not have like a multiple or something like i can not do it
0 yeah i do not know chris it can not be divided by 2 2 remember when we showed here your divisor what you are dividing by tyrese
2 if you have an odd number 2 will not the number that you have 25 cannot be split evenly into 2 groups missus lee and tyrese and we are trying to share 25 chocolate chip cookies guess what
because each of you gets 12.5 i will not split the half that but evenly but you know what you can say 12.5 but that half is that half a whole number
not so that is why this would not be considered an even number good now i am going to say one more everybody to your seat and we are going to look at what ife did
hands no do not touch anything come on back aziz
he just sneezed aziz sneezed in 321 okay ife came up here and we were classifying the number 30 and someone said that 30 was a composite number
did i did the multiple i mean the factors for 30 and what equals 30 if you multiply those 2 factors together and then i listed the factors very good
right now we want to make sure that we try to always list the factors in order correct 30 okay she did one times 30 but we determined that 30 was an even number so if you know that 30 is an even number you know that 30 can be divided evenly into 2 groups
so pretty much what i just said is that 30 divided by 2 gives you a number without a remainder or your quotient without a remainder so what number or what 2 factors should i have right here ms lee give us some time
group 5 well if i put 5 in each group you all remember how to do partial quotient yeah ms right if i have partial quotient . yes help me out here you can go ahead and put 5 and you say 5 times 2 will give you what 1010 how many do i have left
20 then you do 20 20 of that 20 ife how many can i put in each group group okay so i would say 10 times 2 would give me 20
you said times okay so what goes here 0 i add up these numbers here and what do i get
1515 is our partial quotient all right wait a minute we have not gotten there yet so i can not believe we are still doing this that was a good review right there though okay so we have 2 times 15 3 times 10
6 this is just inverse no 9 no
one there should be a 2 here 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 so what she was missing over here you had your 30 over here sweetheart 15 okay so very very good
night on yesterday how do we add and subtract mixed numbers review okay it is a review 2nd 0 this is a review
review and what i want you all to do without saying anything i just want you to check your answers right now do everyone should be checking their work
me thank you everyone should be checking their homework ms lee you are getting in front of screen yeah i will move it down
i know just turn away right so john had a question his hand popped up 1st
you have to answer the question okay so what fraction of a dollar does she have yeah you could have written 3 fourths but so that i know that you understand and you gave me a clear cut solution i would have said 3 fourths of a dollar now is there any way that you could have shown or modeled this
any way you could have modeled it or any equation that you could have you know written to represent it i do not know mackenzie you could have drawn a rectangle come show me
down you could have drawn a rectangle huh split it into 44 groups huh i mean colored in 3 very very good
yes could you have also done it ¢75 over a dollar yeah ¢75 over a dollar yes you could have that is what i did 3 quarters and hillary finds 3 quarters have 75 of a 100 same but how are they the same how do i get from this to this
because there is 4 quarters to a dollar huh and 75 that is 25 75 that is 3 quarters and a 100 is 4 so 75 is 3 because 75 is 3 quarters and a 100 that is 4 quarters so it is 4 75 is 3 quarters
good now how could i have went from here to here what i would have divided by 43 over 3 what would be my greatest common factor between 75 and 100 25 25 that is all you got to do is slow down
25 over 25 and i would have gotten 3 fourths 3 fourths is just my answer in what good did i have questions about any of the other problems here
any other questions upton on number 8 i got d here the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13
rest addition addition okay the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place
the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place and 3 more than the one is digit number it is both right i want to tell you how i would have gotten this answer
i would have taken what they said here and i would have tried it out with each one okay one but wait a minute the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number what even how do we know that d is even
quiet because the last number . now you see why it does not work number i was thinking that like i did not look at the odd number example so then i started with the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than that one yes but you have to read all of it
the sum of the digits of a 3 digit number digits the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13 so the 1st thing i would have done is i would have actually added all these up to see if they were 13 digits and this one did not equal 13 so we crossed that one off 0 so this one did not equal 13 and it was even
d okay very very good
it i did i added 4 and 2 fourths +one and 3 fourths we got 5 and 5 fourths but 5 fourths is not proper fractions so i divided 5 fourths 5 fourths divided by 4 and got one over 14th because after i divided i subtracted 4 -5 huh now give me one i know and get the 4 that is my denominator and added it to 5 and got 6 and 14th very good did you get b for 7 yes excellent excellent job
my mom taught me how to do it on the back very very good now and i want you all to open up your composition books okay and i actually want you to go ahead and just turn to the title page or the table of contents and in your table of contents you will just use a sheet of notebook paper sweetheart
in your table of contents i want you to go ahead and write today is date january 30 2013 and i want you to write we will write addition and subtraction mixed number review
now you guys know the main reason that we are doing this is because you know things are moving so fast i just want to make sure you understand okay and so what is going to happen is let me stop for a 2nd and let you guys get organized
all right i want you all to number your paper from one to 27
fraction you are going to have fraction problems but you are going to have answers so you do one and you do a space 4 yeah like 2 spaces 27 you can actually do 2 columns 5 on that front
desk do not do anything to it yet
page a lot of extra number 6 27 that is what i said did you get one
27 27 stay on track 27 now everybody has an index card on their desk okay what you guys are going to do is you are going to actually locate the number on your card what number is this i am going to show you all where the number is located
the number is located in the top left hand corner corner and you are going to write that problem down by the number and you are going to solve it but you guys get a chance to start moving around in the classroom after you solve the number on your card you go trade with a friend you solve the next number and you trade with someone else
you solve that one and you trade with someone else until i call time minute we are going to start in one minute and actually it is going to be more like 45 seconds and you are going to start with your problem
and then you are going to get a chance to no running just walk okay what do i have i am not telling you rush make sure you do the ones that you have correctly can you just write the answer no i want the problem and the answer and it is okay to trade
you do not have to keep your same card you just trade after you solve that problem
right so you have 5 and 3 fifths 0 you did it on 12 okay go ahead and write get up and move girl
with there you go me there you go
okay let us see how we are doing over here okay let me check you out you are doing a great job here you added your fractions 1st your numerators 1st
55 and 4 fourths 4 fourths equals what one whole so could not you go ahead and write your answer as 5 and 4 fourths equals if it is 6 wholes very very good answer okay instead of keeping it that way
sense okay very good okay let me get number 25
pencil so you had 7 and 3 fifths -one and 3 fifths 6 and 0 fifths well if you do not have if 3 fifths -3 fifths is 0 what should what should this be
6 very good there is no 0 fifths okay well you could have no fifths depending on what the question asks but when you write if you are doing just straight computation like this you would see that 3 fifths and 3 fifths when you subtract 3 fifths and 3 fifths that cancels that out and you end up with 7 -one and you get what
a difference of 6 okay 5 sure like so
me 0 you got it right you are okay you just keep working okay thank you all very much
much thank you all very much much you dropped some paper it we are going to try it with somebody else okay go try it with somebody else you tried it with me twice
here okay i am going to see we are both small so i can see you see all right let me see what you are doing okay good job simplify okay 0 here you did not simplify
fraction now what could you have done here that now show me how you would simplify the fraction part of that mixed number
very good which is equivalent to 4 and 6 tenths very good 6 my have you done that one yet
no all righty i do not know how to get it then whatever you have i have done 5 and 6 tenths let us look at this one let us look at this
bit let me see your hands okay all right right here you have got 5 and 6 tenths how would you convert the fraction part of that to a proper fraction or a mixed number because you would invert an improper to a mixed number so i am going to come down here with your answers okay and you have got 5 and 6 tenths do you remember how to convert an improper to a mixed do not you need to write it
me 12345678 i do not know but i do not want them to make us have to stop davis one and 15th one and a 5th so if you got one and a 5th as your mixed number for this that cancels this out right
so you have 5 wholes and one and a 5th answer do you add half of this one and then add this one yes and so what do you end up getting
6 and 13rd i mean 15th very good girl girl girl girl stop you have been trading with me a lot
18 can i trade i already did number 18
27 the last person i saw had good number one was chris i have number one the last person i saw had everyone is number 10 she traded with me
no 5 i have 5 have you had let me see if i have any low numbers on here you have had number 5 you have had number 17 19 you have had 5 you have had . yeah you have not had 15
go i do not know what you had because you do not have your answer 321 freeze i want everyone to go back it is okay everyone to your seat and i want you to finish up that last problem
on everyone to your seat and finish up the last problem that you are working on huh you had your chance yes go to your seat
one mouths are off and everyone is seated
seated now i am going to put up some of the answers and i want you to check your work see how good you did okay
ready we are ready yes all right shh check your work you see it mackenzie close my door
i converted any improper fractions to mixed numbers
variety how did we do
eyes do not want to see your eyes i want you to raise your hand if you need my help to i am going to be more specific
raise your hand if you do not understand how to convert an improper to a mixed number down raise your hand if you need help simplifying fractions
if you understand all of it stand up and say i got this this i got this i got this i got this i got this all right everybody sit down i got this sit down chris do not ruin it hands down for homework tonight we are going to come back
hand and what i want you all to do is still problem solving because tomorrow you get an opportunity to go back and look at your chapter 15 test
okay and you are going to be practicing adding like fractions meaning like denominators 15 one and on the back you are going to be subtracting like fractions meaning like denominators 15.2 show all of your work and guys number 9 on here you need to answer that
okay give me a clear well thought out response understand yes madam understand yes madam now antonella did something that i thought was very smart she took her homework from last night and she glued it into her composition book i would like for you all to go ahead and do that while i pass out your homework
and once you are done you can go ahead and take a restroom break cards glue it in
okay yeah you do not have a composition book yet here so i am going to have to send your mom another send her a supply list okay
i know they gave her one in the office but i need to email her if you did not get homework raise your hand i did not tell anyone to open my door
ben graphs okay we have been talking about graphs what kind of graphs have we explored this week chucky line graphs okay we have talked about line graphs celeste bar graphs bar graphs that has been most of our focus this week things matthias pie graphs okay we have kind of talked about pie graphs noah
that alright judging by what i have on the board what type of graph do you think we are going to be talking about today
does anybody know another name for the pie graph anna circle graph circle graph why do you think we call it that max why do you think max that because it is a circle that represents the amount of the sets okay good mainly because it is a circle okay
board what are some things you notice just by looking at it notice that half of it is colored blue good all of this side half of this is colored blue us it is books in the jaydon books books books what in the library books that are in the library
library and it is showing us what parts are what different types of books books what is one type of book that it is showing us sandra non fiction okay it is showing us non fiction books chase
we got fiction non fiction history historical fiction good are historical tru i am sorry not true but they are based on things that still happened in history here emily help us out
 we got historical fiction non fiction fiction and that emily is answering when i call on her alright so we have got 4 different things that are being shown here what is the book that we have the most of in the library
graph what is the book that we have the most of in the library lisa what doe we have the most of in the library fiction good how can you tell that so easily noah because it is it is half and all the others are not bigger than half good i like .
half but we can tell most of it is colored blue of green historical fiction this green section here good okay today we are going to work on making our own circle graph this the 1st thing that we are going to do .
chart that looks like this get an imaginary imaginary an imaginary $100 it has to be imaginary because i am not the richest person in the world and i do not have a $100 to give you alright so you have a decision to make
you have to decide how you are going to spend your $100 if you had a budget of $100 for the month and you had to decide where you were going to spend this money you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it i am going to show you how i might spend it okay you are going to have some different categories that you can spend it in so you have you have some important choices to make 1st choice you have to decide how much money you are going to spend on food for the month
what are some things that you might spend money on for food alexis cakes i am going to call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands milk milk olive garden okay you might treat yourself to olive garden martina junk food okay you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food good alright next category
brussels sprouts next category just kidding we are going to talk about clothing wait you are going to decide how you are going to spend if .
clothes you might decide that you only want to spend $10 on clothes you might decide that you want you saw this jacket the other day and you really want to buy it and it is $70 you might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing
11 type of game or one game example that you might be interested in
0 man you have also got movies if you are interested in either one of 2 things here hands down there is 2 different types of movies that i am thinking here movies the 2nd one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the dvd of it
there then finally we have got toys
categories i am going to show you what i would do for my chart moment but i am going to show you how i might decide to spend my money expenses i am going to decide that i am going to spend money on clothes .
things you have to choose at least 3 categories but you can choose more if you want to books and i am also going to choose fl .
area now how much money did i say that i had in all ben a 100 a 100 bucks alright i have a $100 in all to spend so i have to make sure that my total is going to equal $100 okay example gentlemen i am going to spend .
and let me double check 40 and 30 is 7070 and 30 is 100 so i am good dollars it is up to you as long as your total for your categories equals $100
category amounts spent out of $100 if you have to start it like that it is not going to be good okay okay dollars spent out of $100 alright so i am going to write a fraction i 40 how much $4040 out of 100 so my fraction is going to be 40 over 100 celeste help me out here
books what would my fraction be for books celeste 30 out of a 100 excellent $30 out of $100 and the last one fraction 30 over a 130 out of 130 over 100 now when we have talked about percentages all year long what did we say was always true about percentages
max based out of a 100 based out of 100 well guess what we are lucky today with our fractions these are all out of 100 so this is going to be pretty easy i hope for us to convert to percentages
clothes 4040% what percentage of my money am i spending on books daniel 3030% and what percentage of my allowance or my budget am i spending on food matthias 30% 30% excellent job percentages i am going .
graph now probably the hardest part about a circle graph sections one of the papers that i have given you already has it you do not have to worry about it i am going to show it to you up here alright the circle graph that i am going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute
now the circle graph that you are going to get already has 100 spots marked okay so all i am going to do on my circle graph marks i need to color in 40 of those as clothes
here i am going to start here so 12345678910 did you just notice something about where that line is naya each like triangle equals 10 good each one of these big triangles is 10 there yeah i can stop there and just draw a line but i did not do 12
10203040 so this section is going to be 40% of my circle now just like on the graph we were looking at earlier this needs to be colored one color books what should i probably do before i move on to books
happen i am going to do books next and i am going to forget which one was clothes so i am just going to label this as clothes for right now things i could either put $40 or i would put 40% and since it is a pie graph i think we should put 40% as our amount i am sorry you could put dollars that is showing the amount but because we are doing a circle graph i think it is usually better to use percentages okay
books i am going to do the same thing except that i am going to go 102030 so this section would be stephanie 3030% excellent job
then well 3 or 4 different colors depending on how many categories you are choosing food and i am going to label this as food and that would also be 30% there is one other thing that i want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute
thing with my circle graph that i do not have right now celeste a title ah a title and i am not going to write it cause i would end up writing way up there on the wall ti and of course you can be more creative with your title that i am probably going to be an example of a title i might have .
how i would spend my $100 can we change it out for the dollar sign yeah you could well you want to give us an idea the purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about if i titled it $100 it is a cute name like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody is interest but people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about
chucky my budget okay my budget how i would spend my $100 naya my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot celeste i am just trying to double check do we have to use all of them okay okay excellent question categories you have to choose at least .
3 if you want to do every category you can ju let us say you know that you want to buy one book and that is only going to be $5 okay but you have to choose at least 3 categories to purchase things in chase do we have to put money in the categories cause i got clothes movies and food and i put 90 in clothes and 10 in food okay that is up to you we have not actually started yet
i am going to put one other category up here and this is just to give you another option category if you would like to put some money aside to save for later you can always put it in the savings today naya like yours do we have to do that key ah excellent question naya asked a good question that i did not go over i love that
yes it is going to be more clear if you have a key key yeah excellent so when you have a graph you should pretty much always plan on including a a key started all right before you flip your papers over and get started i do not mind if you are in a whisper seats working on your graph
early if you finish before we are ready to stop i want you to turn your paper over and write 5 questions that can be answered from your graph if you do not have if you do not have colored pencils markers or crayons please borrow them from somebody around you
you if you finish with all of it and your 5 questions raise your hand and let me know we will figure something out martinez why are you spending like $30 on food when i usually buy like cereal milk or bread i plan on treating myself to olive garden with naya
alright any other questions before we start it is so cute cause any other questions
i want to color that one so .
10 104078 9100 excellent ooh i have $34 left i got $0 left excellent you can go ahead and start coloring if you are ready hm what there you go emily is going to help you out there i am done
hey does not this picture look a little bit like pacman attacking pacman harper you are ready no you are fine i am i am just visually looking at what you are doing to make sure we are on the right math
1st perfect you may start coloring i can put ¢24 into movies right how many movies you want yes yep that works you are exactly right 4627 and .
on let us see 46 what is this supposed to be
be this is supposed to be at 30% i do not have nothing else that is 20% well i will put something at 20% no that was my games
we understand martinez alright 6075 perfect all right you have got all your percents in you are ready to get started what are we doing he changed the line no that you are going to make a mess all over the place
work that will work
marvelous i like them both so .
 chili lobster awesome miss name can you take me to olive garden can i take you to olive garden yeah like right now i wish i could that would be nice
i do not like olive garden alright now can i call time out for a 2nd are these are going to be the same blue alright that is going to throw me off let me go get you another one
have clothes is here let us see so 10203045 perfect books okay books are 5 food is 20 movies are .
with an open spot alright let me see you pencil i am not seeing it okay so from here 10203045 okay all of that is clothes right
books let us do books here for this 5 there so we have from here to here so far right so we have 102030 and you have 30 left okay so games is 20 ah i see
the games was only at 15 that is why we were missing that 5 much 2020 so do games from here to here sense let me check come on
side so that they would be easier to read cause you are going to see that done that way a lot on graphs okay very nice alright you okay take a breath do not you have her paper for the .
to what you did wrong what would you mess up on i said it is okay but she is not it looks like 2 it looks like 10
title key and title please 0 like that 0
right alright so we have got 20 for the .
food okay and then 30 for games good keep going
movies is 5 so that is going to be to where here yep very good now make me a key down at the bottom so i know what each color represents
on because here is what you are going to need here is where here is where i think we are getting confused
10 thank you again right here you are welcome perfect and then what do you have left savings my voice sounds fun funny savings which is
right is this okay miss name i kind went outside the lines on purpose say that again you know how the sentences that have more than like to subtract what is the difference between the amount of money i would spend on this and the amount of money i would spend on that
what is the difference use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea
time out purple yellow orange alright so you got 2 more keep going yes can i go to miss name today i am going to go get some bread for me
clap clap clap alright i am going to give you about 5 more minutes to finish up what you can what you do not finish in class we will finish for homework but take the next few minutes get as far as you can so that i can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home
this are savings this to food i was supposed to do 20 on the games but then i messed up
books and then 40 twen 1020304045 for clothes works hold on hold on i am just right here budget i will need a bigger closet yes okay that will be in your next budget
over i want you to ask 5 questions that somebody could answer from your graph okay can i put he loves clothes could they ans they actually might be able to answer that from your graph but yeah 5 questions based on your graph
okay beautiful i know right like it alright what is the sum of all the data the one moment please what is the least percent how much okay good
questions alright go ahead and answer those questions we should be wrapping it up in just a moment is it okay if if i put the questions on here that is fine yep
i see 2 things i am missing what just just one else just that what else just that
key and you got 5 questions alright let us take a look yeah you got to write 5 questions do you have any white out no
it is fine no it is fine do it how much more money did i spend on food than clothes but can i say 1st the movies you could say how much more money did i spent on food than clothes and movies altogether
okay can not i put my fun chart very colorful it is bright colors yet okay i will talk to her when she gets in here
alright 543210 go ahead and put your markers crayons down stop where you are at andrew everything down ready to listen again
alright we are going to do one last thing before we leave for success maker graph now that we have had a chance to color our own graphs let us try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph who wants to start us off i think there is probably one that is easier than the rest of them
 50 alright why do you think the blue s ladies why do you think the blue section is 50% cause it is it is half of that okay excellent job half we know that 50% and half are the exact same thing so we are going to go ahead and label this section 50% estimate andrew do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us
4 of those equals 100 excellent job so basically what andrew is saying is that this section is like 14th of the circle and 14th of the circle would be 25% excellent job i would agree with that so how much have i used up so far 75% i have used up 75% so i only have 25% left
us the biographies biographies is the yellow section what do you think i think it is like small 15 okay yeah 15 because cause b .
i what i am hearing you say is that this section will be 25% so we have to decide if this section is 25% this would have to be like 15 or 20 and this would have to be like 5 or 10 okay what martinez give us what you think it would be i think it is 15 because if you add the green one and the yellow one it equals the same as 25 so half of this is .
too okay so half of 25 is 15 i have got to say i agree with you all is reasoning i think that this is somewhere between 15 and 20% and this is somewhere between 5 and 10% so let us say 15% and 10% now double check let us make sure that we have 100% before we move on 50 and 25 would be .
be 858585 and 15 a 180 a 100 a 100% excellent job on naya i know it is an estimate but at 1st i was at least thinking that the green part was 5 okay at 1st glance i am kind of leaning between 5 and 10%
and naya brought up a good point this is an estimate okay now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount but for our purposes this is an estimate
if we had done 20% here and 5% here that would also have given us the 25% this would we ever said this amount was 45% no no it is not anywhere near half of the circle so that is what i want us to be keeping in mind while we are doing and making our own circle graphs today if you did not finish we will finish it for homework
and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys
also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color 13rd 13rd everything i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
you and i am hearing a lot of talking again
anything better akasia one 5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th
now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
really nicholas all the little noises need to stop all and it disturbs other people around you
purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths
okay and white is one 6th
pride so if 0 i forgot to put one thing up there what is one half of one 6th
please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking
12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th color blue
red or is it red actually it was supposed to be brown blue okay this is one 16th is yeah okay so red is one
whoa whoa all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things
empty we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip
so you have another way to really see what you are doing when you are adding and subtracting your fractions and we are also going to use them to model multiplication which we have not really done before in the past few days or probably a week i have asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply
if i am doing 3 times 2 what is another way to describe that problem i am multiplying 3 times 2 what are 2 ways to solve that problem i can just multiply and i know it is 3 times 2 but what is another way paige
adding 3 add so multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add 3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times
so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition to figure out how to multiply those fractions
alone so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with
so let us try one 12th times 3 how could you solve the problem one 12th times 31 12th times 3 what does that mean one 12th times 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem
i used i used one of these 12s okay and use all my 3s okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s
need 2222 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need 3 i need 3 3
one 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please kyla or share with colby actually
2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths nicholas okay
please show me please i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk jabari paige has her 31 12 ths please deshanique do you have your 31 12 ths
desk umm okay got it
pride so one 12th times 3 equals what what what is it kendall 3 12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right
if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3 if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan
thank you thank you boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting
so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please
12 ths show me on your desk is that it
way maybe it is definitely 14th all right akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths
me 4 times 3 right here
4th show me on your desk please 4th we know 3 12 ths and 14th are equal
4th one 16th
down okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to .
this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th 4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we just figured out 3 12 ths equals one fouth
4th please stop whispering stop umm not sure you go ahead and press focus right there
okay okay so 14th 0 there it is it is brighter 14th equals okay
16 ths so what kind of multiplication problem could we write that 14th times something equals 4 16 ths
ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times 4 fourths is it 4 fourths yes 14th times how many one fourths did we use sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault i wrote that very wrong
so 4 16 ths 0 yes 16th one 16th times something equals 14th thank you maisie now i do not know you do know
one 16th times something sorry maisie so akasia here is 14th one 16th times all right colby do you know what boys and girls
too many of us are not following the rules i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering like malcolm akasia
ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this .
4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths
okay okay so how about if we added 4 16 ths +14th what fraction would we come up with 4 16 ths +one 4th
it 4 16 ths +14th you can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator
colby and deanthony stop i am just trying to get your 4 16 ths +14th akasia you got it figured out already
4th christian did you figure it out no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out out panther pride panther pride thank you that is better
4th i will try to help you get it off the camera it is okay anyway go ahead share with your classmates so how we figured this problem out is empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk
chair deanthony and colby you are listening you are not whispering at all go ahead so how we solved the problem was we put 16th right here and 14th right here did you put 16th right here
how many sixths did you put here how many 4 4 16 ths +14th equals one half can you show me please
so we have been doing these problems but what have we been doing instead of modeling them adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla add we are still adding but what did we do differently 1st 1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what
4 times 4 equals 6 equals i mean 16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be
4 fourths what right there yep
please all right kyla is going to prove to us malcolm and kendall that 14th +4 16 ths equals what kyla 88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction one half very good
it okay so one half also equals
okay because you are playing with that matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary here eyes jabari
if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions
you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be one 16th times 3 please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3 kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips
one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it try good it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try
too maisie has got it it panther pride ophelia i still see you talking
akasia one 16th times 3 equals desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me
kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 3 16 ths may i have panther pride ian thank you i see that you are quiet away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
0 well the 1st way i knew is because we did it before and did we do it before yeah we did we did and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one okay one times 3 equals .
33 and then thank you deshanique thank you ian malcolm okay 16 times one is 16
now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please here what does 3 over one mean
remember that fractions also represent division problems so 3 divided by one equals what
again one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths let us try a different one seeing as i would already done that problem how about 14th times 314 times 3 show me please me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip
i do not have a 3rd so i can not show you 14th times 3 it is easy 14th times 3
please you show me what 14th times 3 looks like did any fall 3 fourths that is important
3 once you show me
here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths
panther pride thank you for your patience one 4th times 3
out 14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction you one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right
me too how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore try 2 sixths times 4 how would we do that
4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers show me me 2 sixths times 4 turn around
me jabari show me 4 there are not any how can you make 2 thirds and you might have to participate with somebody next to you also okay it is not 8 12 ths
because 2 sixths times 4
ian thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
paige it is their turn to share get ready to listen please
deshanique we should be quiet and listening to our classmates please boys and girls i am listening for silence right now
up kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening
help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please ready deshanique ophelia
listening malcolm you must listen to each other seat kyla put both of your feet on the floor and listen
though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening
better put that down
attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please
what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down
4 okay 2 sixths times 4 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then equals 26 times right here
equals is what 8 6 ths okay do you see that akasia 1234567 okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction
okay okay so one and 2 sixths once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed mixed number they had one and 2 sixths so jabari how many sixths does it take to make one
one how many sixths does it take to make one jabari what does the denominator tell us
what does the denominator of a number tell us colby the number tells you like like like how much it is in the whole how many what in the whole much how much whatever you are how many .
parts 0 parts equal parts how many equal parts so jabari how many equal parts do you need to make a whole if each part is 16th jabari you need 6 sixths to make one whole 6 sixths equals one right okay you guys are going to try some of these on your own
are we allowed to do our work under this
yep looks good i need my bag
wrong what would 3 thirds be if you have 3 parts 3 parts altogether you have 3 parts of the 3 altogether
not right now
okay 2 4 ths
spend the next few minutes working without talking kyla akasia already leila umm akasia please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit
yep nicholas keep the congratulations inside your head for a few minutes
so it is okay that is not a big deal
nicholas wow minute paige it is silent time right now
kyla you are sitting there doing nothing
numbers all right now kirby could you give me a big big large number 1012 now where do you get that is it 1000 a large number or extra large extra large 1000 yeah because our our focus was in how many how much is a 1000 so that is a large number
how much is a 1000 how many 10 do we have in a 1000 how many 100 do we have in a 1010 we have 2000 good job 1000 in a 1000 and we did our we did our what did we do to the chart of or book of 1000 all right okay pretty soon pretty pretty soon when we finish that set
the section 2 pretty soon today we are going to kind of have people helping people because some people i walked around the other day and see some people have difficulties completing the last section of unit 2
2 the section 2 is really asking you to either add and these vocabularies kirby these vocabularies when you adding they ask you what question look at the vocabularies and tell me what question do they ask you when you are adding
how much is it all together or how many by now there is another question when they ask you to either add or take away or subtract see all these vocabulary words subtract now one question ingrid they always ask one question when you need to take away
subtract subtract they ask you that question and we said we learned that you could do it both ways ingrid look at the vocabulary words and tell me which which word do you see more often very often to subtract now yeah when we subtract how many more
money so that probably i said 0 maybe i need to add that we learn how to do with both ways we could add or we could what that means when we landmark in that number and our landmark could be walk forward and or walk if you step back doing and some people show me that in that book when i check it some people say 0 i know what to do
whatever how much more do we need to get to a 1000 now the things that i would like to introduce today but we are not going to focus on it too much now if we if we if you just turn around for a minute just turn around face back with the place value chart that we have just turn around you do not need to get up just turn around thank you
all right now we have one 10 100 100 all right very good i have everyone looking at me then we have 1000 what do we have before that the comma 1000 we bet on so this is 1000 place and it is
2 no in the 1000 place we have 2 but 10000 100000 10000 100000 let us stop there let us stop there in the 1000 place let us see people who are really paying attention like reggie is doing good good kirby nick good job
all right now we we just stop in the 1000 but not just 1000 please but that is but not just 1000 please now i want to ask you a question in the 10000 place how many how many 10 do you think is in 10000
200 wait a minute 10000 place how many how many yes 2010 or no in the 10000 please 0 how many 100s are in
10000020000 that is the simple things now next next like tomorrow and next week we are going to work in the 10000 hey 10000 place 10000 chart 10000
10000 now listen how many 100s how many 100s can you get me a ruler then 100 how many 100 do you think
how many now see what you are saying rebecca rebecca now you are answering her that is not good sorry thank you now listen how many 100s is in that 10000 110 100 or one 100 10100 100 that is all 100 time 100
now see . 0 100 times 100
same right now listen we learn today
it when are we going to learn about 1000000 that is a question i will answer later all right good job all right now listen reggie reggie reggie and nick
now if you have something really to share question question for rebecca question for kirby
now the page is that we still going to work how many 100 is in the 10000 was in here 0 yeah look at that on the board i put it how many 100 and we just learned that how many 10 is in 10000 10000 10000 so another thing
exactly see now i could tell some people have good strategy it is like 5 and 200 added to number 0 we add 2 more . equal to thank you now listen carefully i want to see people who are ready
book now i need i need to see people who can who are doing ingrid you do not have your math book on your desk desk math book math book
but the problem that is remaining a problem for everyone is the money problem how much more money and the decimal part of the money is the one that is giving some people a hard time when they ask you when they ask them what is your change what is the change that you should have is the one
so on page listen on page 23 check for me check for me is it page 23 that asks you for a money problem is it 23 or 21 check 2323 is a money problem 231 and 23
21 we are looking into these 2
let us see if nick are you willing 0 all right 21 will be more let me see can i see can i see yours thank you 22 we are not in 22 we are looking into 23 which was a money problem
it rebecca 23 rebecca rebecca it is unit 5 landmark in large number and we are going to 23 very good job right is it unit 5 23
good job now that page reggie could you read for me sarah could you read this yeah solve the following addition problems and she and show your solution and show your solution
problem huh are we do we agree on that yes yes we all know so by reading the direction when it is word problem it is important that you read the direction and they want you to solve and it is a money problem problem now let me let me ask ismael to read the problem
now now i want everybody everybody is following see he is not paying attention and he is not on that page job if you are on page 23 and for these people that are have already done it
us tara saved 11 . saved 143 from her baby sister 123 $123 good job
line all right tara saved $143 from babysitting and open . a bank account a bank account
$829 more i like to hear the word more remember we are focusing more so yeah 100 more keep reading and i know something how much money does she have in the bank the bank of the year 0 this is an easy problem
it all right turn around turn around turn around let us see let us walk around and see those people that kind of did the good job and we will share the answer we will share the answer 0 please we will share the answer and i will give you a few minutes because you i know you are so good at adding
minute one minute now i will give you a minute to solve it and do whatever they ask you to do do now you know what can i have this good job
check and see if you add right good job maybe i do not know right check and see check with your neighbor and see if you add right just check that is okay i will check with you
now could you ask that question again that last question they ask you how much money does she have in the bank in the bank did they at the end of the year now is it an altogether problem
excellent how much how much yeah all right now you cannot move forward now you do not do that all right do not do it all right now next question next question let us move to problem 2 problem 2 number 2 number 2 daphka can you read that problem for us
job now excuse me nick nick so she is done reading now your turn to continue
yep all right how much money did she spend spend how much money did she spend no we do not need the answer some people i am going to touch yeah no no money everyone should have done how much money because i i hear a decimal how much money is the decimals in there yes
yes it is almost a dollar but it is not yet 2.50 right 2.49 almost 2.50 is not there
my goodness see she is she is not really paying attention she is not paying attention to hers your answer probably is right but if you do not pay attention to the decimal dollar sign are you really paying attention to it you are not looking at yours okay that is the thing
you know what in your after you add you need to pay attention to that you what did you do with the decimal you add do you add the decimal while you adding did you add the decimal add the decimal see that is the thing you are not paying attention to me you do not add the decimal where are the decimals good job good job
you know you are not really you did not add it and if you add it in your result there would be where is the decimal did you additional did you add it yes where is it in the answer now where is the answer where is your answer look at your answer look at your answer that is the problem i feel people have
see you you see you add those decimal where did you put them 0 wow see she does not he does not add it
what was the 1st price the 1st price what was it
799 and i put my dollar sign $99 yeah it is 9 okay now what is my next one
$2.492 49 and that is my decimal and 49 almost ¢50 good job
sign and you have to put that dollar sign thank you so people start adding and you always start adding on the . one place one and then on the ones place ones place is always . 1st the left and the right side right hand side
way excuse me nick nick nick this is the ones place and we add on the right hand side
one and then do i carry the one or what do i do see he is not paying attention that person i am doing it for he is not paying attention when i say add the decimal and this is i add the decimal add the decimal
on one minute for your question add the decimal then what do i do continue carry the one carry the one yeah 88 +2 equals 10 yes yes that is 2 people rebecca is not paying attention else i am showing you how to add the decimal down here
do never never forget to add your dollar sign and your decimal and it is so easy but some people it is easy that is why some people forget
yep you give us good feedback yeah now listen listen ismael listen need they asked me a question what else do i need to do about that question nick can you help me
sentence now check to see if you write a sentence for each of them let me see people who did write this and i know good job sentence some people did not and i know who but i am not saying anything and i am waiting for them to write that sentence down but some people told me i am done i am done but i see i could tell and i see
and that is why we go back for some people who already completed a lot of the work sentence i am correcting 0 you are correcting good job how about you kirby did you write a sentence yes yeah what is your sentences he spend $10 to $28 10000 10000 see you did not correct now this is 10000 or 1000
all right now let us see he spent let me see what he spent . see you still did not did not i . i am glad i checked you did not add the decimal 0 it looked like . i did it because of you
yeah good job ah did you write your sentence let us see this sentence job sentence sentence good job see good job
do let me see job dollar sign dollar sign good job easy yeah yeah can i see if you do a good job probably did not huh no no
no see now kirby is adding dollar sign where he does not you need to pay attention money another money problem money problem that kind of give people a hard time
money where and we will see number 4 about the decimal 3 things now let us put down 3 things we learn about money problem do rebecca rebecca rebecca i need your help 0 okay 3 things 3 things so money let us put down money problem
1st of all with that dollar sign good job problem be careful be careful we are not remember
let us put it in a sentence if you want to put it . remember in your learner is notebook today i rebecca control it
hand you are very happy today
remember when we are doing money problem and then we are going to go over decimal sign decimal sign do not forget decimal sign decimal decimal is decimal a sign no it is end it is end decimal is called end end so could i put decimal and or decimal is also and when you are reading it
so reading number 2 all right now let me wait for let me wait for juliana yes juliana number 2 so we need to remember decimal to add decimal add decimal and it is end the dollar sign do not do not forget to add
and do not forget when you are doing dollar sign dollar sign see i just put it dollar sign
she asked me a question and it is maya that remind us decimal could be read as end end and this is something sometimes we skip it or we forget $5 and $5 and and $25 and you mean a and d and yeah or d and no not the end but and
$2.49 and we could read could be read as $2 and 40 and see the and $48 and 45 and ¢49 job all right now something we need reggie 3rd things we learn do not forget to add the dollar sign
decimal and the cents and the cents and the same sign yeah but once you put the dollar sign mean you know where to add it how about line or column line them in column yeah because line sometimes you get confused you get messed up
up line up what what do we line up numbers so sometimes i put this sign for numbers reggie again yeah huh sometimes i put that sign for numbers
all right look at that you are supposed to know how subtracting or adding now that is one thing that is in the problem but we are talking about after we add or subtract then things we need to remember 11
me as we are adding or after we are adding
yep but you add a 0 next to 5 thank you that is another thing but 3 important things you say when you finish did i when i say revise your math rebecca when i say revise your math these are the things i say especially if it is money yeah if it is money 2626 we are on 26
today 123 ah now let us see if daphka is with us on page 26 job and i see yes
us nick close one of the starting problem above use it to solve this problem okay so is it a money problem
work if you are talking you are not raising your hand you can not talk to your neighbor and we need your participation now that i am going to take away no no no notes away notes away notes away no no i do not want that no notes away yeah okay nick is the one that is reading and he is going to help us
on the top this is 9 94 $5 so they said this one they call it a starter problem problem starter mean what shirley what does starter mean you it is a beginning or it is a start problem and that problem could help you solve the next one
how many people understand that the starter mean yes they give me a problem to start with or they give me something that i could look up to now what is the starter problem juliana 0 i got you wrong juliana what is the starter the starter problem tell me the starter problem is a problem no no you do not need to repeat just tell me what is it on page 26 that we are going to start with
problem it is a money problem $9949 $5 $9 and i put the dollar sign do not forget $994909949 and 94 yes $9.94 cents thank you
9 and 94 $5 one person please 11 rebecca rebecca you are not really helping us if you are not really wait for your turn to talk rebecca yes
see people who are paying attention watch my mistake
did not they say $9 $5 so it is $14 now how does this starter problem will help now let me wait for rebecca rebecca is really up yeah they give me 2 more starting problems rebecca rebecca yes now what is the next problem they give me
the next problem is to choose one of the 3 problems above and use it to solve this problem that they give you i know but what is the next $9 wait a minute we did this one no that is it
one that is not the next one that is the next one fine $9 $5 we did that no $9 $5 so how is this going to help
$9 $9 $4 so we take away the 94
away yeah we take away the 94 and one so we take away 194 and that gives us what
only $5 left is it take away it is addition take away it is addition thank you but that is $5 this is a 5 yes
let us see if they really choose it is a dollar sign okay i just now i am glad
see ismael is working . did you do this one okay ooh
it you have not done this one you know you could all right shirley could you give her a hand sure let us see see can i see
no i know 15 okay we will find some more things to 0 good job that is not true she was covering too i am already done okay i did not do that one
okay that is you do not have to you do not need to do this one i can help you all right now listen 2526 that is what we did i want you to check 27 check 27 and 2827282728272827282728 good job
let us see 27 it is the 1st number on this is very and you have to time it by 10 by 101027 good job
now i want you to see you did not finish this could you help him with this good job for a minute
okay help him you may turn over now wait here you may turn over give him a hand right here and right there when i come back i am going to check and see thank you reggie a ¢100 is a dollar right yeah so if you can not but why do not you put why do not you put the dollar you did not put the dollar sign sign the dollar sign
0 that is 11 no dollar sign good job and where is the decimal that we talked about decimal where is the decimal it is a dollar one one so it is one
job now if you add a dollar to $14 you get $15 and there is ¢10 left i got a pen no this one she did this one did she do a good job there she did not do the 1st one okay so do the 1st one let us see people who are really see i am taking this i am really taking it
i need to ask it i just did not do it because i was working my 1000 but do not worry no you are not doing this we need you 0 you did this 0 you also did this okay good
god rebecca could you check with daphka and see if she really gets it sure thank you no you do not need to bring it just check daphka daphka rebecca is going to give you a little bit of help
do you really need i really do not huh thank you
minute good job
doing she is good okay good how is ismael doing job decimal decimal is there a decimal there now
job victoria good job you and then we will all right good helpers friend helping friends reggie sit down
okay shirley thank you rebecca thank you let us check together all right let us see
now could you tell us what he did not get help what help did you give him him rebecca rebecca rebecca i need you to listen to him yeah all right hold on
hold on we are really some people are not listening let us wait for rebecca again thank you
job now we are sharing what kind of help did that person need so that person gets it and moves on know but some people miss a few victoria i need your help when it is time to do our final sharing coming together see what we learned
again i helped with this and showed the numbers that he can not add 0 he could not add a few numbers it he can not add he could not but now he could listen reggie now he can now he gets it
all right how about somebody else he did not know how to use to break it apart break it apart just to use another problem to help solve the other problem good job all right because that one asked you to use the starter problem to help
again because when one is talking we need to have everyone listening so she kind of helped her with use that starter problem they already did for you to start you started and then use it to solve the next problem which is similar but they make it a little bit different
shirley she had money and she did not know how to break the numbers ingrid did you learn something yes okay what did you learn now add the money
yes but i do not know the way you were talking i thought you knew when i looked at the 1st problem we did about money you told us so much that was helpful so how do you feel now
you she got the things but she just needed somebody to check them good job of the decimal she is kind of like keep on forgetting about them but all the answers are right very good how do you feel daphka you get .
okay so the thing that we learned today what one you number one do you need your paper for that no no you do not need to make it simple just number one now ismael ismael we need you we need you to sit down i learned about large number huh i know
but we did not stay and say . hm hm number i do not know what is the number i wanted to are you reading are you reading for him number what did you learn about large number what did we do we did we broke it apart all right hold on willing we broke it apart i have a problem we got to the 1000
no large number what did we do 1st things what did we review what did we review about large number 1000 thank you thank you yeah how many 1000s in 10000 10000 how many 10s on 10000
thank you that is just times and i hear your voice and when we are doing our final sharing i want everybody to go home and tell their parents thank you thank you what we learned now what else so large number that is what we reviewed and you were telling me .
me yeah 1000 is a large number
wait if juliana wants to tell me i am waiting and everybody is getting there what else paper okay you can not all right go ahead
more how many like how may more how many more are similar money it could be cookies it could be anything when they ask you how many more and we could add or we could take away to figure it out
all right but it is your own strategy that counts one things exactly 0 i know how to do it people tell me a lot of times 0 i will do it this way i will do it that way person the other thing that we have learnt huh is when you do your money problem hold on hold on
back what do you need to put in a money problem like a decimal point decimal point in the money problem sign decimal decimal line up numbers line up numbers line up numbers correctly correctly so you could when you add in the decimal that is a vocabulary also all right
that is a vocabulary wait so what would be the word there are many vocabulary words we do not even put up there yeah so which one do you say we should have put up there no no
on it is 11 30 december 13 this is math class so recording is in progress okay let me have your attention please boys and girls
put the books away and get your folder ready and your notebook as well as your box so last week we have been exploring volume right prism so can someone just tell us and or remind us how you have how we found the volume
prism we multiply the length by width by the height okay so we figured out one way to do this it was to multiply height okay so that was one way to find right and we all tried that please the bottom of the surface times the height the bottom of i think the bottom of the surface the surface here you said
yeah okay so surface for example this one has 5 across and 4 this way mean the surface has 4120 squares and if you were to put cubes you can put 20 cubes right the bottom layer huh and why do you multiply by 3 dylan because that is the height because that is the height that is the 3 layers right
so if you were to take apart the 3 layers then you have 3 layers of cube tried no okay so last time you made this box and this is box one and we did volume and i think everyone i would say everyone did very well on the test on friday in terms of finding volume
okay so i do not think anyone had a problem finding volume and maybe there is a couple of problems with other things being careless you know for example the pattern that you miscount or miscalculated and then you something else just being careless but in terms of volume and i think you had no problem doing that so today we are going to shift into something not volume but similar
well i should not say similar to volume but something that we can use this box to find to help us to start okay and that is called a surface area okay so today we are going to explore finding the surface area of an object of a rectangular prism
means alphonsus okay so the surface like you know this board has a surface right the floor has a surface but what about area area selina so area is the number of
for example this floor you can count the number of squares the number of tiles this board if we put a grid here then you can also count the number of squares okay so does that have to do with the inside cubes if we are just looking at the surface no
it okay we are thinking of we are looking at surface so if we all right why did you say no louis maybe because it is not finding the whole prism okay it is not the whole prism but it is just the surface
so for example if you just look at the surface of this how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box 4 yeah and what about the surface of this the bottom of this box how many squares do you see
same so can i say that they have the same surface or the area same now but if you look at the 2 boxes do they hold the same number of cubes no so can i say that the volume is different okay one but what about the surface just the bottom we are just looking at the bottom yeah same right
so area is the same but volume is different so if we look at the surface are we looking at the inside you know how many cubes it can fit okay so for example this paper has a surface
right okay but if i turn it this way suppose you can look at the paper any are you supposed to you know if this is 2 dimensional right okay but it has a surface but there is no volume and last week i think we said that volume has to do with what kind of objects
the shape the 3 dimensional 3 dimensional solids 3 dimensional solids right dylan so i want you to remember this boys and girls and as we find the area or the surface we are not going to think about the volume okay 0 just momentarily no problem so .
what was i saying the volume okay when we look at the surface area we are not going to think about volume okay so what you are going to do is to create a box that looks like this but this time i am going to give you a grid that looks like this instead of the pattern you will have to figure out the pattern okay for making this and you just draw it and cut it out and make a box okay the size of this all right
and this is the same as the 1st one that you made last week before you added okay now after that okay pay attention please okay after that you are actually going to use this as a cover and this is a box so you cover this box and now it is a rectangular prism right
okay so again we are not looking at volume so not the inside but only on the outside the surface okay so let me just let me just help you start by looking at one of the surface one of the sides
so let us say the box you know it is like this simon right sides front back okay
so okay how can we find the surface or the area of this front this top side
jackie measure length from width length okay that is 6 centimeters 6 units and then 4 units this way many 33 units there are 24 not just units but square units okay
so 6 times 4 ah square units sense so now we took care of the top
sides how many sides are there in a rectangular prism sides 3666 right 66 top bottom 12 front back 34 side side 56 okay
so what you are going to do is you will make this box 1st and then i want you to write okay the top area figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom the area of the front side area of the back side the side one of the sides and then the other side okay mean we have found all the surfaces right
sides and then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism we add em up we add all the edges up you just add everything up and then you have the total surface area okay so why do not i have you start by making the top
so this is for pattern pattern for box one . okay yeah people will hook them we have like 15
and then can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way you okay does everyone have one more yes so use a pencil to to make the pattern
okay can you stop for a minute jackie okay so how many squares across how many units if you count from here how many 4 square units how many 4 right square units here is it also 4 square units
yes so is this going to match huh you make okay you need to make a pattern that is this size right okay and only one layer one unit high okay
good very good very good no that is 25s you all set judy
up 0 so here you just cut the corner is that right yeah okay that is fine you can do another one tape tape just tape the top and you do not have to tape the lid you know the cover
okay yeah just tape the side so you can cover this
okay do you remember we talked about this or the surface area of this whole rectangular prism
wait simon the area we are looking at
share because like right here if you put the cube in right this square and this square are the same square so they are part of the same cube cubes okay we are not doing cubes anymore and this time simon it is just the surface just the surface okay just the surface
so this has nothing to do with that because we are not doing cubes this okay okay okay so remember surface area area is just the surface not the inside okay that is a good point
calculating okay write in your notebook just like the way i wrote on the board so once you have your box boys and girls you can start figuring out the surface area of this box box it is just like counting all the squares around this box okay
2 right okay so that is why you did it twice okay and how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangle and then you have the surface surface area
okay very good okay are you what are you working on
that is good okay so ming what is the strategy for finding the surface area
now all right so tell me how you can find the surface area or what is the surface area the top the area of the top you find it by multiplying the length by the width okay and why did you why do you have to multiply the length by the width
to figure out the area where is the area number what are these square units good
that means they are all these sides all together do well can you figure out this area of this side
well you can do this right you can do this so once you have all 6 then then what do you do i do not know okay so let us see that in your notebook all right so let us put this aside and why do not you start writing
hey boys and girls i need to see that in your notebook okay area okay lawrence where is it put this book away
where is the surface area i do not know and you need to show me how you found 108 108 what units surface area is that a unit
okay all right are you all set
step if you have tape yes you can just take this corner all right okay samantha you know what is happening what are you what are what are you looking for now
wait are you sure after we add to all these we add all the colors why adding why do you need to add those numbers and what is surface area
the area of the 3 dimensional shape okay kevin if you were to explain to someone what surface area is let us say you have this prism okay then what do you do it surface area is the area
so once you have found 6 surfaces and then you just add them right and that is exactly what marlene just said good excuse me okay now if you were looking at this box like this right so where is the top
this is the top bottom front back right side and side sides and you can also look at it from this angle front and then what would the back be
right side and side right so depending on how you look at the box if you put it up this way then this would be the top okay
box and then figure out okay the front side back top bottom okay esther let me see your let us see
next we count the bottom area okay and what do you notice about the top and the bottom they are the same okay and can you see that they are actually the same
me okay michael i want you to start figuring out the the answer and how did you get this number well at 1st i was looking at this then i do not think we can count it squares no
kevin did you write down the surface area and you showed how you found it okay
these okay well that works because you are looking for the surface of this whole thing right but what i would like you to do is to take this box like one side at a time so you calculate the area of this side this side this side this side this side and then what do you do at the end
red yes sir right there okay let us see okay very good all right okay maybe another minute
finish and then if you are done i would like you to write down okay listen in please to write down how you can calculate or find a surface area of a rectangular prism okay so if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find a surface area and what would you say
so i think most of you have found that the area of all the sides okay so how can we find the area the surface area or the area to all of these sides around this rectangular prism what is this you have to combine all the areas okay do you agree with that you have to combine all the areas okay of the area of the sides
area okay james
yes okay why is it important to say square units instead of units same no because a square unit would be 3 dimensional 2 okay square units mean okay are these squares yeah so are these square units yes
mean you actually count squares number of squares so when we say cubic just like last week we count the number of okay so it is very important that you use the right unit okay be let us say this is the front
the front area would be .
it marlene did you disagree no so is it wrong that it is 3 by 66 by 306 by 3 does it matter same okay now group one it how many people actually have 3 units by 6 units
units okay and do you get the same answer the same number of squares how many have something different for the front side
so this is your front side is that right joshua okay okay so simon both explain to us please like it depends on the okay one at a time
it you could you could say you could like say this is the front as well you could like say this is the front this is the front okay and do you agree with him depending on how you look at this right and i drew this up here i say we are going to look at this box from this angle side but if you look at it from this way that is your front the front side right
also yeah okay all right so let us just keep this as the front side
kevin it is the same is that right good and then the side so this side and that side okay dylan what is the side or left side
this so what is that side or this side oops this side 03 by 4 okay
so 3 units by 4 units and that is 12 okay and then the last one okay selina
okay and that is 12 right okay and i asked you to write down how you find the total surface area say lily coyne how can you find the total surface area
these okay so now the surface area of this rectangular prism is
set yeah okay so let me give you another one to practice and you can use this box or you can draw a box but this is it has different dimensions okay so for this 11st of all i am going to have you find the volume and then you will find the surface area okay so this is the rectangular prism
minute simon let us leave that up okay
i have to draw what i want you to draw the prism and then i want you to find the volume
yeah so earlier we said that we can find one layer and then multiply it by the number of layers right so what is that bottom layer hold 44 okay now remember we are going back to volume so the number of cubes you can put inside
0 without this 12 so now there are 2 layers 24 right so volume is 24 cubic inches that is good
okay excuse me
mean the number of cubes we can put inside right
are we supposed to just leave the numbers without labels and then what i would like you to do is to find see if you can find an easier way to find the surface area instead of finding the top and then the bottom and the front and the back way i think there is
times okay if you want to look at this 2 times 4 is 2 times 2 times that and then times 28 no no no 2 times one and then like easy like these 2 numbers you times them so which is 8 and you do 8 for the next one as well okay you do times 2 times 3 which is 64 times 3 12 times 12
okay why did you do those twice each one twice because like for each side like right here i am going to try no no that is not that is not right you still find the same answer because each side is the same okay like on the other side huh this side and the back side it says right the top and the bottom okay very good
so you notice the front and the back and the top and the bottom those are the same and instead of finding it 2 times you know you just find once and then multiply by 2 good so maybe you can try to write a formula okay those people who finished see if you can write a formula for finding a surface area
see if there is an easier way to do that instead of doing 6 steps and then add is there an easier way
so you can do 4 times 2 times 2 so but that is only 3 steps okay i have got the answer good so so you do not have to repeat that right because it okay very good can you write a formula just write it down 00
so the formula is i would be just adding just multiplying it out numbers they are the same right yeah and so are these you see
formula i can not yet write a formula if you can write a formula to find surface area something that is easier you know than doing one side at a time
you could do top times top plus front plus right times 2 i did it so top area plus front area plus right area times 2
equals i got one step we do length times height times width remember what that we did that last week right so what is that
0 i know how what would that be if you multiply it
yes it is like one is over here and then the other side right good boys and girls it is almost time for us to go so but we will come back after gym i am sorry okay so when we come back excuse me listen okay so i would like you to think about a way or a formula or a shorter way an easier way to find surface area
okay and then when we come back we will have a few more minutes before lunch and then we can talk about that okay
so and for homework okay i do have more of these rectangular prisms simon for you to go home and find and practice finding surface area okay so why do not you just leave everything here and then line up quietly
so last week we have been exploring volume right and volume of a rectangular prism so can someone just tell us and or remind us how you have how we found the volume okay of this box or this rectangular prism we multiply the length by width by the height okay so we figured out one way to do this it was to multiply the length the length
the width the width and then the height okay so that was one way to find right and we all tried that another is there another way to find this dylan the bottom of the surface times the height can you speak up please the bottom of the surface times the height the bottom of i think the bottom of the surface the surface here you said yeah okay so surface for example this one has 5 across and 4 this way
mean the surface has 4120 squares and if you were to put cubes you can put 20 cubes right the bottom layer huh and why do you multiply by 3 dylan because that is the height because that is the height that is the 3 layers right so if you were to take apart the 3 layers then you have 3 layers of cube
tried no
well i should not say similar to volume but something that we can use this box to find to help us to start okay and that is called a surface area
means alphonsus okay so the surface like you know this board has a surface right area selina so area is the number of
for example this floor you can count the number of squares the number of tiles this board if we put a grid here then you can also count the number of squares okay so does that have to do with the inside does that have to do with cubes if we are just looking at the surface no
it okay we are thinking of we are looking at surface so if we all right why did you say no louis maybe because it is not finding the whole prism okay it is not the whole prism but it is just the surface so for example if you just look at the surface of this how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box
4 maybe 24 there are 24 squares right because it is 6 by 4 yeah and what about the surface of this the bottom of this box how many squares do you see 4 are not they the same yeah yes same so can i say that they have the same surface or the area
same now but if you look at the 2 boxes do they hold the same number of cubes no no so can i say that the volume is different okay yeah this one versus this one
but what about the surface just the bottom we are just looking at the bottom yeah same right so area is the same but volume is different so if we look at the surface are we looking at the inside you know how many cubes it can fit okay so for example this paper has a surface
and you can see the number of squares here right okay but if i turn it this way suppose you can look at the paper any are you supposed to you know if this is 2 dimensional you are not supposed to see any height right okay but it has a surface but there is no volume
just momentarily no problem so .
so let us say the box you know it is like this simon okay now let us say this is the top okay i just call it the top and that is the bottom right sides front back okay
many 33 units there are 24 not just units but square units okay
so 6 times 4 ah square units okay does that make sense
top okay and then what other sides how many sides are there in a rectangular prism 666 right 66 top bottom 12 front back 34 side side 56 okay
so what you are going to do is you will make this box 1st and then i want you to write okay the top area figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom the area of the front side area of the back side the side one of the sides and then the other side okay so once we have all 6 of those what does that mean
we have found all the surfaces right all the sides and then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism we add em up up you just add everything up and then you have the total surface area okay of this okay so why do not i have you start by making the top
and then can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way you okay does everyone have one
yes so use a pencil to to make the pattern and then you cut okay okay yes there is one more on the right there yes
okay so make sure you count carefully . jackie do you know what to do okay can you stop for a minute jackie okay so how many squares across how many units
if you count from here how many 4 square units how many 4 right square units how about this way from here to here is it also 4 square units yes
so is this going to match huh you make okay you need to make a pattern that is this size right okay and only one layer one unit high okay
all right very good very good very good no that is 25s you all set judy not yet . why are you making another one louis because i messed it up
0 so here you just cut the corner is that right yeah okay that is fine you can do another one what are you looking for
tape just tape the top and you do not have to tape the lid you know the cover okay yeah just tape the side so you can cover this just like a box okay . okay now that is the same as this okay
who is using duct tape so how boys how do you think we can find the area
wait simon the area we are looking at
okay simon can you say that again what do you mean they share because like right here if you put the cube in right this square and this square are the same square so they are part of the same cube yes
so we can not count them twice but remember what we said
in other words how many squares are there all around this okay okay okay so remember surface area
box it is just like counting all the squares around this box okay so that is the number of squares area
this how did you figure these out
okay so you are saying the top area is the same as the bottom area okay
okay then what about the last 2
right okay so that is why you did it twice okay and how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangle and then you have the surface surface area okay very good
all right so tell me how you can find the surface area or what is the surface area top the area of the top
that means they are all these sides all together all right yes sir do well can you figure out this area of this side how about the area of this
area right so once the area around the box yes so how do you find the total surface area well you can do this right you can do this so once you have all 6 then then what do you do
so you need to write down surface area okay lawrence where is it put this book away
sure after we add to all these we add all the colors why are we doing this why are you adding why do you need to add those numbers and what is surface area
the area of the 3 dimensional shape okay kevin if you were to explain to someone what surface area is let us say you have this prism okay then what do you do
so once you have found 6 surfaces and then you just add them right and that is exactly what marlene just said is that right very good excuse me
okay now if you were looking at this box like this right so where is the top this is the top bottom front back right side and side
can you see there are 6 sides and you can also look at it from this angle so can this be the front and then what would the back be right side and side right so depending on how you look at the box if you put it up this way then this would be the top okay
so you have to decide how you want to look at this box and then figure out okay the front side back top bottom okay esther let me see your let us see
so what do you have to do next we count the bottom area okay and what do you notice about the top and the bottom they are the same
okay and can you see that they are actually the same yeah all right now you have top and bottom excuse me okay michael i want you to start figuring out the the answer and how did you get this number well at 1st i was looking at this then i do not think we can count it
okay just like the way i wrote on the board is it a red sir right there okay let us see
so if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find a surface area and what would you say
area okay james
yeah so are these square units yes so it is important because they can be any type of unit
mean you actually count squares number of squares so when we say cubic just like last week we count the number of cubes or boxes right cubes okay so it is very important that you use the right unit okay
be let us say this is the front
no so is it wrong that it is 3 by 66 by 306 by 3 does it matter it is the same okay now group one all right okay hold it hold it how many people actually have 3 units by 6 units
okay how many have 6 units by 3 units okay and do you get the same answer the same number of squares how many have something different for the front side have i have 3 times 43 times 4
so this is your front side is that right joshua okay okay so simon simon which is front is this front side or is this front side this is probably both what do you mean both explain to us please like it depends on the okay one at a time it depends on the way you look at it
you could you could say you could like say this is the front as well you could like say this is the front this is the front okay and do you agree with him depending on how you look at this right and i drew this up here i say we are going to look at this box from this angle
side but if you look at it from this way that is your front the front side right also yeah okay all right so let us just keep this as the front side and what about the the cole so what is that
kevin it is the same is that right yeah okay very good and then the side so this side and that side okay dylan what is the side or left side
so 3 units by 4 units and that is 12 okay and then the last one okay selina
okay and that is 12 right okay and i asked you to write down how you find the total surface area say lily coyne how can you find the total surface area all of these
okay so now the surface area of this rectangular prism is
yeah okay so let me give you another one to practice and you can use this box or you can draw a box okay so for this 11st of all i am going to have you find the volume and then you will find the surface area okay
prism okay wait a minute
44 okay now remember we are going back to volume so the number of cubes you can put inside 0 without this 12 so now there are 2 layers so 24
right so volume is 24 cubic inches that is good and now you are going to think about the surface area okay me so volume how did you find the volume what is that
okay now remember volume going back to last week what does volume mean the number of cubes we can put inside right so what units do we call those what is that top
and then the surface area since we are looking for area it is just the number of squares right did you finish lawrence yes
now what are you supposed to do to these numbers are we supposed to just leave the numbers without labels and then what i would like you to do is to find see if you can find an easier way to find the surface area
instead of finding the top and then the bottom and the front and the back is there an easier way is really yes i think so 2 times okay if you want to look at this 2 times 4 is
2 times 2 times that and then times 28 no no no 2 times one and then like easy
like these 2 numbers you times them so which is 8 and you do 8 for the next one as well okay you do times 2 times 3 which is 6
huh this side and the back side it says
see if there is an easier way to do that instead of doing 6 steps and then add is there an easier way
because this is the same on the other side so you can do 4 times 2 times 2 so but that is only 3 steps okay i have got the answer good so so you do not have to repeat that right because it okay very good can you write a formula just write it down 00
so the formula is i would be just adding just multiplying it out okay what do you notice about these numbers they are the same right yeah and so are these you see
so how can you write a formula i can not yet write a formula if you can write a formula to find surface area
yes you could do top times top plus front plus right times 2 i did it
just write the whole formula surface area equals i got one step we do length times height times width remember what that we did that last week right so what is that how what would that be if you multiply it
i figured out an easier way okay because if you know the top area is 6 times 4 you do not have to do the bottom because it is going to be the same
so you go the sides and both sides and front and back and then left and right okay so if you only find one of them and then double multiply by 2 then you find okay very good it has got to be the same
yes it is like one is over here and then the other side
good boys and girls it is almost time for us to go so but we will come back after gym
okay and then when we come back we will have a few more minutes before lunch and then we can talk about that okay so and for homework okay i do have more of these rectangular prisms simon for you to go home and find and practice finding surface area okay
ben graphs okay we have been talking about graphs what kind of graphs have we explored this week chucky line graphs okay we have talked about line graphs celeste bar graphs bar graphs that has been most of our focus this week
things matthias pie graphs okay we have kind of talked about pie graphs noah double line graphs we talked about double line graphs
that alright judging by what i have on the board what type of graph do you think we are going to be talking about today
does anybody know another name for the pie graph anna circle graph circle graph why do you think we call it that max why do you think that because it is a circle that represents the amount of the sets okay good mainly because it is a circle okay
board what are some things you notice just by looking at it notice that half of it is colored blue good all of this side half of this is colored blue us it is books in the jaydon books books books what in the library books that are in the library
library and it is showing us what parts are what different types of books books what is one type of book that it is showing us sandra non fiction okay it is showing us non fiction books chase
we got fiction non fiction history historical fiction good are historical tru i am sorry not true but they are based on things that still happened in history here emily help us out
 we got historical fiction non fiction fiction and that emily is answering when i call on her alright so we have got 4 different things that are being shown here what is the book that we have the most of in the library
graph what is the book that we have the most of in the library lisa what doe we have the most of in the library fiction good how can you tell that so easily noah because it is it is half and all the others are not bigger than half good i like .
half but we can tell most of it is colored blue of green historical fiction this green section here good okay today we are going to work on making our own circle graph this the 1st thing that we are going to do .
chart that looks like this get an imaginary imaginary an imaginary $100 it has to be imaginary because i am not the richest person in the world and i do not have a $100 to give you alright so you have a decision to make
you have to decide how you are going to spend your $100 if you had a budget of $100 for the month and you had to decide where you were going to spend this money you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it in so you have you have some important choices to make 1st choice you have to decide how much money you are going to spend on food for the month
what are some things that you might spend money on for food alexis cakes i am going to call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands milk olive garden okay you might treat yourself to olive garden martina junk food okay you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food good alright next category
brussels sprouts next category just kidding we are going to talk about clothing you we are going to wait you are going to decide how you are going to spend if .
clothes you might decide that you only want to spend $10 on clothes you might decide that you want you saw this jacket the other day and you really want to buy it and it is $70 you might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing
11 type of game or one game example that you might be interested in
0 man you have also got movies if you are interested in either one of 2 things here hands down there is 2 different types of movies that i am thinking here movies the 2nd one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the dvd of it
there then finally we have got toys
categories i am going to show you what i would do for my chart moment but i am going to show you how i might decide to spend my money expenses i am going to decide that i am going to spend money on clothes .
things you have to choose at least 3 categories but you can choose more if you want to books and i am also going to choose fl .
area now how much money did i say that i had in all ben a 100 a 100 bucks alright i have a $100 in all to spend so i have to make sure that my total is going to equal $100 okay example gentlemen i am going to spend .
double check 40 and 30 is 7070 and 30 is 100 so i am good dollars it is up to you as long as your total for your categories equals $100 next i am going to go to the following category
category amounts spent out of $100 if you have to start it like that it is not going to be good okay okay dollars spent out of $100 alright so i am going to write a fraction i 40 how much $4040 out of 100 so my fraction is going to be 40 over 100 celeste help me out here
celeste 30 out of a 100 excellent $30 out of $100 and the last one fraction 30 over a 130 out of 130 over 100 now when we have talked about percentages all year long what did we say was always true about percentages
fractions these are all out of 100 so this is going to be pretty easy i hope for us to convert to percentages
clothes 4040% what percentage of my money am i spending on books daniel 3030% and what percentage of my allowance or my budget am i spending on food matthias 30% 30% excellent job percentages i am going .
graph now probably the hardest part about a circle graph sections one of the papers that i have given you already has it here alright the circle graph that i am going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute
now the circle graph that you are going to get already has 100 spots marked okay so all i am going to do on my circle graph marks i need to color in 40 of those as clothes
here for my clothing chucky eyes up here please eyes up here here so 12345678910 did you just notice something about where that line is naya each like triangle equals 10 good each one of these big triangles is 10
but if i needed to do like 12 could i stop there 10203040 so this section is going to be 40% of my circle
now just like on the graph we were looking at earlier this needs to be colored one color books what should i probably do before i move on to books happen i am going to do books next and i am going to forget which one was clothes so i am just going to label this as clothes for right now
things i could either put $40 or i would put 40% and since it is a pie graph i think we should put 40% as our amount i am sorry you could put dollars that is showing the amount but because we are doing a circle graph i think it is usually better to use percentages okay
books i am going to do the same thing except that i am going to go 102030 so this section would be stephanie 3030% excellent job no we are going to make sure that we have 2 different colors and then .
well 3 or 4 different colors depending on how many categories you are choosing food and i am going to label this as food and that would also be 30% there is one other thing that i want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute
thing with my circle graph that i do not have right now celeste a title ah a title and i am not going to write it cause i would end up writing way up there on the wall ti and of course you can be more creative with your title that i am probably going to be
 how i would spend my $100 can we change it out for the dollar sign yeah you could well you want to give us an idea the purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about if i titled it $100 it is a cute name like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody is interest but people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about
chucky my budget okay my budget how i would spend my $100 naya my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot celeste i am just trying to double check do we have to use all of them okay okay excellent question categories you have to choose at least .
3 if you want to do every category you can ju let us say you know that you want to buy one book and that is only going to be $5 okay but you have to choose at least 3 categories to purchase things in chase do we have to put money in the categories cause i got clothes movies and food and i put 90 in clothes and 10 in food okay that is up to you we have not actually started yet
i am going to put one other category up here and this is just to give you another option category if you would like to put some money aside to save for later you can always put it in the savings today naya like yours do we have to do that key ah excellent question
yes it is going to be more clear if you have a key key yeah excellent so when you have a graph you should pretty much always plan on including a a key started all right before you flip your papers over and get started whisper but you need to be at your seats .
early if you finish before we are ready to stop i want you to turn your paper over and write 5 questions that can be answered from your graph if you do not have if you do not have colored pencils markers or crayons please borrow them from somebody around you
you if you finish with all of it and your 5 questions raise your hand and let me know we will figure something out martinez why are you spending like $30 on food when i usually buy like cereal milk or bread i plan on treating myself to olive garden with naya
was it is optional see you at olive garden tomorrow there you go some good sushi
104078 9100 excellent ooh i have $34 left i got $0 left excellent you can go ahead and start coloring if you are ready hm
1st perfect you may start coloring i can put ¢24 into movies right how many movies you want yes right 4627 and .
on let us see 46 what is this supposed to be
this is supposed to be at 30% i do not have nothing else that is 20% well i will put something at 20% no that was my games
w we understand martinez alright 6075 perfect all right you have got all your percents in you are ready to get started what are we doing he changed the line no
that you are going to make a mess all over the place
marvelous i like them both so .
it if i am in a happy mood yeah if i am in a happy mood i am going to go with .
lobster awesome miss name can you take me to olive garden can i take you to olive garden yeah like right now i wish i could that would be nice i do not like olive garden alright now can i call time out for a 2nd are these are going to be the same blue
have clothes is here let us see so 10203045 perfect books okay books are 5 food is 20 movies are .
with an open spot alright let me see you pencil i am not seeing it okay so from here 10203045
books let us do books here for this 5 is 20 up to there right so we have 102030 and you have 30 left okay so games is 20 ah i see
the games was only at 15 that is why we were missing that 5 much 2020 so do games from here to here sense let me check come on
side so that they would be easier to read cause you are going to see that done that way a lot on graphs okay very nice alright you okay
on i was just i was just wanting to on i said it is okay but she is not it looks like 2 it looks like 10
 make a key yep you need a key and you need a .
we will make sure you get it right alright so we have got .
 food okay and then 30 for games good keep going yep very good now make me a key down at the bottom so i know what each color represents
on because here is what you are going to need here is where here is where i think we are getting confused you got to do this 5
10 thank you again right here you are welcome perfect and then what do you have left savings my voice sounds fun funny savings which is
right is this okay miss name i kind went outside the lines on purpose say that again you know how the sentences that have more than like to subtract what is the difference between the amount of money i would spend on this and the amount of money i would spend on that
what is the difference use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea
purple yellow orange alright so you got 2 more keep going yes can i go to miss name today i am going to go get some bread for me and i .
clap clap clap alright i am going to give you about 5 more minutes to finish up what you can what you do not finish in class we will finish for homework but take the next few minutes get as far as you can so that i can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home
this are savings this to food i was supposed to do 20 on the games but then i messed up
games 5 for books and then 40 twen 1020304045 for clothes works hold on hold on i am just right here budget i will need a bigger closet yes okay that will be in your next budget
job turn it over i want you to ask 5 questions that somebody could answer from your graph okay can i put he loves clothes could they ans they actually might be able to answer that from your graph but yeah 5 questions based on your graph
okay beautiful i know right like it alright what is the sum of all the data the one moment please what is the least percent how much okay good now would you be able to answer those questions
alright go ahead and answer those questions we should be wrapping it up in just a moment
is it okay if if i put the questions on here that is fine yep i see 2 things i am missing
else just that what else just that
key and you got 5 questions alright let us take a look yeah you got to write 5 questions do you have any white out no again there you go make sure your name is on it we are just about finished yes you may
it is fine no it is fine do it how much more money did i spend on food than clothes but can i say 1st the movies you could say how much more money did i spent on food than clothes and movies altogether
okay can not i put my fun chart very colorful it is bright colors yet okay i will talk to her when she gets in here
alright 543210 go ahead and put your markers crayons down stop where you are at andrew everything down ready to listen again
alright we are going to do one last thing before we leave for success maker graph now that we have had a chance to color our own graphs let us try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph who wants to start us off i think there is probably one that is easier than the rest of them
think i think the the blue one is 50 alright why do you think the blue s ladies why do you think the blue section is 50% cause it is it is half of that okay excellent job half we know that 50% and half are the exact same thing
estimate andrew do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us
4 of those equals 100 excellent job so basically what andrew is saying is that this section is like 14th of the circle and 14th of the circle would be 25% excellent job i would agree with that so how much have i used up so far 75% i have used up 75% so i only have 25% left
us the biographies biographies is the yellow section what do you think i think it is like small 15 okay yeah 15 because cause b the green and the yellow is 25 so if you take off like a little bit of it .
i what i am hearing you say is that this section will be 25% so we have to decide if this section is 25% this would have to be like 15 or 20 and this would have to be like 5 or 10 okay what martinez give us what you think it would be i think it is 15 because if you add the green one and the yellow one it equals the same as 25 so half of this is .
will be 25 too okay so half of 25 is 15 i have got to say i agree with you all is reasoning i think that this is somewhere between 15 and 20% and this is somewhere between 5 and 10% so let us say 15% and 10% now double check let us make sure that we have 100% before we move on
be 858585 and 15 a 180 a 100 a 100% excellent job on naya i know it is an estimate but at 1st i was at least thinking that the green part was 5 okay at 1st glance i am kind of leaning between 5 and 10%
and naya brought up a good point this is an estimate okay now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount but for our purposes this is an estimate
if we had done 20% here and 5% here that would also have given us the 25% this would we ever said this amount was 45% no no it is not anywhere near half of the circle so that is what i want us to be keeping in mind while we are doing and making our own circle graphs today if you did not finish we will finish it for homework
but in this case you do not necessarily have to be as creative to even give us a list of problems to choose from so that was pretty helpful was not it
okay so we did set a together but i want to show you an example of something that you will be working on this morning you are going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner so here is my example i have chosen set a since we already solved a together on friday so what you are going to do is here is your list of directions i am going to give you and a partner a split and on that split is one of the sets on your sheet
the only one that is not represented is a because i am doing a for you so i took a out of the possibilities so you might get set b c all the way to f you do not know which set you are going to get
that is why i asked you to be prepared over the weekend and come in with them all finished already you are just going to add a little bit of some work to that today okay
so with the split a set that i give you you are going to solve each of the small more manageable problems in the cluster which you already have if you did all your homework so all you have to do is rewrite them on a slip of paper
so you solve all the smaller ones okay
so solve each of the small problems decide which ones that will help you to get the answer of the large one
yes so here is an example of what this will look like after you draw your open array we are going to write a short little description of how you solved the final problem and why you used the problems that you used
he is making sense of breaking down the problems a little bit different is that okay to do is that okay yeah so if you are working with a partner on the same set is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem yeah
what do you think brian yeah do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses no me pay attention pay attention who can answer my question who me why because the 4 of us may think a different way
you are just there to support each other you do not have to do the exact same work because you each have your own way of thinking about things and you each already thought about them for homework anyway so it is up to you how you come to that conclusion of what to use
solving each one deciding on which problems to use open array short description of your thinking why you did what you did and how you got to the final answer okay
so i did set a 4 x 10 is 40 4 x 40 is 160 4 x 3 is 12 and 2 x 43 is 86 the final problem is 4 x 43 so what made sense for me when i was figuring out what to use to solve this was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3
is it the only way i could have done it
all i have to do is what add the what chris what is that word with the p
the products right i have to add the products from each of these and it gives me the product for the final one
so i did not really have to do any extra work did i me are there other ways i could have solved it
certainly but i only have to solve it in one way for this purpose madam yes
okay any other are there any other questions no
you might end up sitting at other people is desks and that is fine with me just please be thoughtful of their belongings do not touch things that do not belong to you
but we are going to be working at desks so whatever partner you get with you need to find a desk to work at
you can not work on the same desk okay clear and like i always say your partner is your partner for now
get your slips one for each of you
allison and edna nancy and josue alvin and edna catherine and mario and christopher and arlene s
and caroline and carlos you have 2 students absent and you are still even which is good carlos and caroline no
all right so are we settled and how are you working together i just want to get the answers all right so how are you working together okay so is 50 10 x 5
so the 50 is 10 x 5 so will this answer be 10 x 5 30 right okay so will this answer be 10 x this product so how will i get that product think about it
i will be back back up a little bit i do not know where you are with this okay so you chose in order to solve 70 x 5 you chose this so this is 5 +7 +7 equals 9 right and here i have 76 which is one
so after you choose this one you choose this one 71 all right so right here
so the other problem is 70 x 5 right how is 70 x 5 related to this you already know the answer to 70 x 5 it is 80 x this okay and then what is the difference between these 2 problems this is 70 x 5
7 so how many more groups of 5 is this and then you change the number so if you do 70 x 5 you get this and if you do 6 more x 5 you get this all right that is it
and you have to do it this way all right you are going to do it this way
it is not going to be hard anymore and so did you figure out the answers to your small problem yet
2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 this is 2 groups of 58 right how many groups of 58 are there 2
how many x do i have to make this array to match this problem do you guys agree with me on this 3 x 3 x total or 3 more x
why and i only have 2 here but there is 6 so there is 6 here if i were to make this 3 more x .
what do i do to all these to get to the answer so what i asked originally was what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
it just happened about how i need 2 more of those so i would say this is only 2 more x that would mean that i have 4 of them with all of them
amy what would you do with these 3 problems i agree why would you add them all you each one is just too big to carry right so why would you add them all
when i add up all of the units of 116 how many units of 58 do i have 6 how many units 6
so you need to put your own symbol on the list so 50 x okay so you start with what is on the list and then you decide to make your own problem which is 8 x 6
okay i like that you did that and that this is definitely going to get you to the answer which is 8 x 6
however there is a multiplication here and so it is going to affect your result what is 8 x 6
4 are you going to use your partner can you use karla to support you
okay well let me tell you what this means for you
here michelle which set did you get
b yes okay and did you work together to solve the smaller problems yes
bit let me ask you this what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
how many 2s are in 53 so how many times would you have to do 58 x 2 to get to 58 x 33 and let us maybe we can draw an array and see if that works out
so each of these multiplication problems in parentheses represent one sector of the array so when you were trying to do 58 x 4 it was a 2 array and i think what we found out was that this was the addition part
way all right so you and chris which sector did you choose 6
did you each get the same answer of 248 and did you solve it the same way
caroline this 50 x 6 is different than what you were doing here you chose 58 x 2 earlier 58 x 2 this is what all this work represents 58 x 2
here your equation is here your addition is here and then why did you start talking about a different problem there is it just a mistake what should this problem say
is it 50 x 6 that you used or 50 x 2 that you used 50 x 2 is what you used you could have used 50 x 6 but you did not did you
and just re read your explanation to make sure it is exactly what you wanted to say well please start writing to me
so 58 x 2 because i got the half of 6 and separated it into 3 pieces of 2
2 and what did you do with it and i how many x did you do 58 x 2
2 is 13rd of 62 +2 +2 is 6
and your major your major long line of equations is right here this represents your array here is your picture here is your equation it is complicated it is it you know what it is very complicated that is why we have lots of possibilities for what you said
we can have 2 groups if we have time arlene you sort of raised your hand
i know you are not fully done with your poster and that is fine but could you could you still come up could you still come up here and talk about it
you can pick one of your ways if you want you do not i know you went all out and did 2 strategies but if you want to just pick one way you can do that you want to could you do that
up tell us what set you were working on on everybody else is pausing please caroline sit down all the way on the bottom i was working on set c okay what was the final problem you were going to solve 32 x 8
okay was there were there any other partners working on set c no okay so listen carefully think about whether you did it similarly differently or or what 8 okay so the main problem is 32 x 8 and you did 30 x 8
that because i needed to add 8 to what how many quarters of 8 do you need you did 30 you did 30 x 8
8 all right all eyes up here let us tell barbie so your major problem is your final difficult problem is 32 x 8
okay right and you did 30 x 8 8 how many groups of a does she need to have 32 so how many more groups of of 8 do you need
2 more groups of 8 right you still have to multiply this 2 by the 8 you did the 30 x the 8 but you have to multiply all the parts of this number by this number so i still need the 2 x 8
so you have this answer right which is what 240 and so how many more or how much more do you have to add with 2 x 8 you so what happens when you combine 30 groups of 8 +2 groups of 8
what do you get as a total 256 very good very good thank you one more group one more partnership caroline do you want to come up it you did a lot of work over there come on up you have no problem speaking up right okay what was your set
b okay set b which is what but what is the final problem carlos what is the final problem in set b 6 who else did set b
any other partners adrian are you paying attention are you paying attention it does not look like it
do i broke it into i broke it into 6 yeah so caroline took the and caroline and carlos took the 6 and they broke it into 32s 246
so these 2s are what fraction of 6 caroline 13rd 2 is 13rd of 6
x does that make sense okay usually we take the big problem and we make 2 smaller problems but with caroline she made it made more sense to her to do 3 problems because she used the 58 x 2
and what did you get as your answer so all these groups of 2 add up to the 6 and the 58 of 30348 who else did group set b and abraham and aiden what did you get
348 is your answer all right so we are going to pause on that
time free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45 right shhh is it looking at you right now on we are going to try to pretend it is not here please counting down from 5 4 3 2
you shush you shush too i am going to pick 5 prize winners today and they are going to get to pick from the prize box and the 1st person i pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box so it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can
say yes jamari did not i get picked out yes you can pick later for that too out no thomas and jamari okay so let us get started so that we can get to work on
today students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly polygon okay stop there students will be able to determine jamari to do okay something else to learn maybe to .
to learn okay answer no and you need to not call out decide to figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon right
is do you know me because i want to know that you knew and you will get extra points for that down now what we are going to start with see is that our homework ms
jensen this is not your homework is not that homework okay i know this is listen i know what a polygon looks like this is one minute off of free time up shut up man i i understand that it is different having a video camera in here but
go now again guys this is a video camera no big deal okay
ms you know what is funny what we usually do not act like that since when we are doing math when the camera is not here exactly no saying this is not how we normally act during math so let us try to make it normal pretend it is not even here okay okay now we are going to talk about
no okay all the talking guys come on not i will wait no one is even talking you know what guys
i will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether if somebody is talking and is not supposed to i will take care of that on please do not whistle so sorry but there is a camera
okay and again camera should not make any difference
what if we press that button i do not know which way is it on jamari does not when it has the green when it has the green on that little circle thing okay when there is like a light coming right here yeah okay sit sit sit sit it is red okay so let us wait and see if it comes on or not freeze it is coming on okay
hit the 1st 2 lights please no it is not yes it is how do you know okay again wait a 2nd yeah just 2 just half
you no so boring you know what okay sorry sorry you are not going to be famous okay all right until i get this on let us take a look at the paper in front of you
polygons polygons they are shapes it is the corner i did not ask about the corners paper looking at the paper okay the top 3 shapes they are telling us that those are polygons okay and the bottom 3 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so what i want you to do while i get this fixed is i want you to look and try to figure out head what is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons now guys circle it that is not a polygon no i am right now i can not spell right now i know ms
jensen maybe the plug is not working the kind of plug 0 you know what 0 wait the thing is not on
problem that is not what hey he did not do that because he saw the plug unplugged all right everybody stand up
ms jensen he is talking about my mom jumping jacks 15 of them let us go ms jensen he is talking about my mom i will take care of it seat okay now sit down
okay maybe the battery maybe it is the plug up up there hold on a 2nd yes can we pause this only because i am having major technical difficulties with my board
and so the kids are all silly anyway fix so someone let us start and somebody read our content objective again
me again students can students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon polygon or not a polygon okay so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon okay and we just said that we that determine means to figure out or decide so we are going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or is not a polygon
okay now someone read the language objective xavier students 0 wait students will be able to define a polygon students will be able to define a polygon okay so not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or is not a polygon but before you can do that you have to know what a polygon is right before anybody else heard of it before nope no
today the paper in front of you and up here has 3 shapes that they are telling us are polygons okay and the bottom 5 shapes they are telling us are not polygons so the 1st thing i want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons
it because i am going to give you another sheet in a minute and you are going to work with you to try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons okay so do you understand what i said richard yeah repeat what i said for me please repeat what i said
you are going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons okay and you are going to work with a partner to do so so take a look at these again and notice what they have in common 3 notice what they have in common not going to take comments
partner and and the bottom ones you are going to figure out why are they not polygons what is different from the ones on top okay so i am going to have richard nathan and jamari work together as a trio xavier xavier you are going to work with josea .
and what you are going to do is if you think this shape is a polygon you are going to write a p on it if you think this shape is not a polygon you are going to write an n on it for not not can i do this one too nope because that already tells you they already tell you there that is your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon
isaiah and justin together please miguel and thomas together please marvin and isaiah together please what we work with partners as we are assigned in this class and you get rewarded when you work with okay umm
marvin work with isaiah please okay you know what with no you are working by yourself if you do not work with him here thomas and miguel isaiah is going to work with you too okay
said hey do you know what you are doing what is the matter what is the matter can you work with thomas at least or you do not want to work with thomas ms
so do we cross it out nope you write p if it is a polygon you write n if it is not a polygon all right n partner did you decide what makes a polygon and what does not yeah all right if it is a polygon are you guys talking to each other
polygon i think a polygon is fully shaped fully shaped okay this is not a polygon okay well talk to your partners about that tell them
break you did not ask for a pencil you asked for a break right no i did not hear you thomas
is now do we agree him ms
2nd no it does not matter but does look it like it
are yes right and we have not done the definition so that is okay if you do not get it correct but i want you to look and see if you can think of something that these shapes here have in common have and then find the ones that have the same things in common on your sheet okay these 2
ms jensen yes
answers and i am going to tell you in a minute no worries if it is polygon you put the one
okay that is a polygon i am asking you it is not there no it does not that is just that is cool right it says polygon and then it says not a polygon you it means we are going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that are not that is so easy that is my name right here okay to your seat
sorry ignore what is up here so far this has nothing to do with whether it is a polygon or not
step xavier your seat is over here please be in it xavier not in 5 minutes right now
josea you 2 need to stay in your seats here did some of us
i will wait no point of arguing okay
seconds or actually bring it back to your seats where you were that is fine after i want to talk about the next step you i confused some of you and rightfully so because what i did was i drew 2 circles on the board and i put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other
but what this means is we are going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet and the ones that are a polygon we are going to put inside this circle and the ones that are not a polygon we are going to put inside that circle so i am not telling you this is a polygon this is not a polygon
attention no it does not yes it does i will wait 31 xavier xavier yeah please put that down
me okay you can tell me in a 2nd then because i am going to give this marker out for a 2nd and i am going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that is on your paper and put it in the right circle so for example you could choose number one and if you think it is a polygon draw it in the polygon circle if you think it is not a polygon draw it in the not a polygon circle
the one thing i am going to say is let us draw them about this size so that we have enough room okay miguel not right this 2nd yes is this it or this not i want to
i do not think i read it right now the one thing i am going to ask is make sure because i know the figure that he is drawing is like this right way let us make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that so jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon
thank you okay
okay if you disagree with him when it is your turn you can put a question mark inside his polygon okay but you could come up and you could put a question mark inside
richard thank you for your enthusiasm you know what enthusiasm means right so richard draw us a polygon or not a polygon i am not even doing nothing do you know what you are yes i know
josea you have had how many good days in a row like the whole week almost right do you want to really blow it now on all right so richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite right
right isaiah see you are going to write with a pencil go ahead draw me one that is either a polygon or not a polygon
please a bit more than that chance okay good stay there
i would josea you had a chance 1st what is that a diamond no
over it is a square i need you looking at this now that is perfect and they are not going to look exactly like they look in the picture do umm where is that marker
please wait why did you give him the marker what number was yours josea mine yep what do you mean number look at your sheet what number is it 9 what number is yours jamari mine is one we will put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape what number was yours what number was this
it was 2 no that one is 2 that one is 2 okay okay isaiah would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon in your opinion or one that is not a polygon ahead not is over here
do i have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon justin put the number up there too okay
it number 8 we are discussing the paper what number is that we are discussing it okay okay this one i got one
do that is not a polygon i got one right yeah no i do not know which one have not you done one already let us let everyone have a chance 1st ms jensen hold on
turn do you have one that is not a polygon uhh no
it that looks like a state or something on the map
it looks nothing like mpas where does it come out okay what number is that
you forgot to write the number you are not showing no no no because all right let us take a look at that all right let us take a look up here
i know there is some that we have not gotten up there but i want to see if we can come up with some rules that we think makes a polygon a polygon or makes a polygon or makes something not a polygon ready ms jensen you need to sit down
now yes there does anybody have a question about someone is up there thatt hey think ah i do not agree agree i either think this is a polygon or i think it is not a polygon i think they got it mixed up
think 3 of them okay go put the question marks in them now why because it is not time to draw it is time to do math yes it is why you know the rules richard you know the rules the same rules every day
do you have more that go up there or do you have a question about one start xavier huh we are we are discussing if the right but right now i need you up here please
you i appreciate that you are talking about math but right now we are going to have a whole group discussion about math okay there i want your 1st thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not
polygons okay is there something that you notice about those 1st 3 polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have
yes that the ones the 31s on the top are like regular shapes like square a star so you are saying that they are regular shapes okay right well are not these regular shapes here too though
yeah okay anybody have anything else that when they 1st look at these they think hey i know what these polygons might have in common
they have to be together they have to be together so richard is saying they have to be together sure what do you mean by together
okay so what richard is saying is that this is not together okay whereas this is together
richard when we talk about that in math when we talk about a shape like this that does not meet and a shape like this that does meet about a closed shape .
okay now a closed shape all the line segments and it is hard sometimes with this of course it is not going to even look like that but but miguel i can take care of it myself thank you
now an open shape could look something like this right difference this part of it is left open this it is all closed say that polygons richard is theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes
richard are they open or closed closed closed i do not know why that is coming out red but color we are looking for characteristics of polygons
in math when we are talking about characteristics we are talking about attributes if i was talking about jamari one of the characteristics i could use to describe him is that he is kind and he is gentle friend those are characteristics that would describe jamari right
what we are doing now is we are coming up with characteristics that describe polygons okay another word for characteristics is attributes so what attributes do polygons have polygons i could describe jamari as tall kind gentle
polygon one way we are thinking to describe a polygon is that it is a closed wait a 2nd 12nd okay and we know that that means all the
the sides are even okay this needs to be recalibrated but closed i did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot
it now so do you see how all 4 sides meet yeah that makes it a closed figure so a polygon is a closed figure can you give me something else that is an attribute you think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons miguel the sides have to meet the sides have to meet miguel says
that everything meets like in the corner
jensen okay saying that excuse me now saying sides meet at corners miguel is different from lines of symmetry okay saying that sides meet at corners here we have sides meeting at corners right here we have sides meeting at corners
okay but that is different from lines of symmetry on 1st look there would not be any lines of symmetry to this figure okay so that is okay it is good thinking and this is actually you are on the right track here okay but i do not want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it does not really have to do with that
corners okay the lines are even so all the lines are even
polygon so this might have equal sides but it does not seem like you have to have equal sides does it no so that is something that some polygons might have but we are looking for things that all polygons are going to have nathan uhh pointy they all have points okay so you are saying
a no problem you are saying she has been up for a minute because rocky needed the bathroom but she wants me to brush her hair there okay so these polygons here umm what was the question repeat repeat what you said nathan
do the corners corners okay we are getting some great math vocabulary words here sides corners does anyone know and i used this word before this might be a new one for you what it is called when we have a straight line the part of a straight line
that line right so we can say about polygons that they have sides right
what line segments all the polygons have lines right
segments so sides are line segments now let us get back to what nathan said right so we know that they have sides that are line segments that they meet at the corners okay
anyone know the math term for when 2 line segments meet like that to form an angle it right angle vertical they are called vertices okay where 2 line segments meet and make angle are called vertices okay
here you know miguel i am glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes now now you have to walk all the way over there that is okay that is okay
it now so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure list that is a very good list can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that 1st page here .
common can we agree that they have corners vertices that they are line segments that meet at those corners at our not right now let us hold on
now not polygons figure they are always open open figure they are always open no no corners no corners meet okay so let us look at this
if we have as our 3 characteristics i am going to write inside of this okay closed line segments vertices and vertices
okay we know it means that they all have line segments as their sides that those line segments meet i got one in the corners which are vertices and that it is a closed shape
right that is extending out from this vertice okay closed it has a line segment this vertice but not really right what cut in half but not really because what
no yeah no a line segment is straight okay a line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this is if it is not straight it is circle not a circle oval it is not an oval but what is the what is the .
the line here is not straight so it is not a line segment it is curved right polygon what about this it is crooked it is crooked it is crooked it is not that it is crooked because this is a straight line one side is bigger than the other this is a straight line one is bigger than the other okay let us go back to let us go
on i want to go back to our 3 attributes that we came up with so far closed line segments and vertices that does it have line segments yes is it a closed figure
closed well yes let me let me take that back because we missed and this is my bad segments the thing about polygons my fault is that the thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices but they do not cross
cross okay so they never cross that is the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon one it crosses it crosses that is the problem with this one is that it crosses
okay so that is not a polygon bottom it is not closed it is not closed here it is 2 shapes right it is not one shape right now is this shape if we took this triangle away is that a polygon
polygon yes but put them together they are not polygons right job let us go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see polygon yes yep consensus yes is this a polygon yes is this a polygon
curved they are not line segments right so no closed yes does it have straight lines that do not cross does it have straight lines that do not cross
vertices do they all meet at corners not it is because i look kind of crooked it no these are in order you are getting confused in order for a line to be straight it does not mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way
it can be any way it just can not be curved okay closed yes is are they line segments that do not cross yes are they do they have vertices yeah is it a polygon yes yes to let us go to not a polygon is this not a polygon yeah correct
one why is it not a polygon it is a polygon because it has straight lines it has straight lines what else and it has line segments polygon so who put the question mark up here jamari jamari did you you were right jamari that is
well i should not put a correct mark because this is a polygon okay right not a polygon tell me you think it is not a polygon tell me why you think it is not a polygon isaiah because it does not have the the even sides it is curved yeah it is curved okay
here that is right this is not a polygon right it is not a polygon what is wrong with this one that has crooked like the lines okay take crooked take crooked out of your vocabulary right
right it is not a polygon okay number 12 that is not a polygon i want to take a look at that polygon because it it is not even what do you mean it is not even one of the sides is shorter than the other side did we say that the sides have to be equal over here
no we have we said that the sides have to be line segments that do not cross figure i was right on that one too closed yes you were is it a closed figure or an open figure closed do they meet at corners
polygon you know what okay when we were i want you to remember that when we were doing this we did not even know the definition of a polygon okay
on it is 11 30 december 13 this is math class so recording is in progress okay let me have your attention please boys and girls
put the books away and get your folder ready and your notebook as well as your box so last week we have been exploring volume right prism so can someone just tell us and or remind us how you have how we found the volume
prism we multiply the length by width by the height okay so we figured out one way to do this it was to multiply height okay so that was one way to find right and we all tried that another is there another way to find this dylan the bottom of the surface times the height can you speak up please
the bottom of the surface times the height the bottom of i think the bottom of the surface the surface here you said yeah okay so surface for example this one has 5 across and 4 this way mean the surface has 4120 squares and if you were to put cubes you can put 20 cubes right layer huh and why do you multiply by 3 dylan
because that is the height because that is the height that is the 3 layers right so if you were to take apart the 3 layers then you have 3 layers of cube tried no
okay so last time you made this box and this is box one and we did volume and i think everyone i would say everyone did very well on the test on friday in terms of finding volume
okay so i do not think anyone had a problem finding volume and maybe there is a couple of problems with other things being careless you know for example the pattern that you miscount or miscalculated and then you something else just being careless but in terms of volume and i think you had no problem doing that so today we are going to shift into something not volume but similar
well i should not say similar to volume but something that we can use this box to find to help us to start okay and that is called a surface area okay so today we are going to explore finding the surface area of an object of a rectangular prism
means alphonsus okay so the surface like you know this board has a surface right the floor has a surface but what about area area selina so area is the number of
for example this floor you can count the number of squares the number of tiles this board if we put a grid here then you can also count the number of squares okay so does that have to do with the inside cubes if we are just looking at the surface no
it okay we are thinking of we are looking at surface so if we all right why did you say no louis maybe because it is not finding the whole prism okay it is not the whole prism but it is just the surface
so for example if you just look at the surface of this how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box 4 yeah and what about the surface of this the bottom of this box how many squares do you see
same so can i say that they have the same surface or the area same now but if you look at the 2 boxes do they hold the same number of cubes no so can i say that the volume is different okay one but what about the surface just the bottom we are just looking at the bottom yeah same right
so area is the same but volume is different so if we look at the surface are we looking at the inside you know how many cubes it can fit okay so for example this paper has a surface
right okay but if i turn it this way suppose you can look at the paper any are you supposed to you know if this is 2 dimensional right okay but it has a surface but there is no volume and last week i think we said that volume has to do with what kind of objects
the shape the 3 dimensional 3 dimensional solids 3 dimensional solids right dylan so i want you to remember this boys and girls and as we find the area or the surface we are not going to think about the volume okay 0 just momentarily no problem so .
what was i saying the volume okay when we look at the surface area we are not going to think about volume okay so what you are going to do is to create a box that looks like this but this time i am going to give you a grid that looks like this instead of the pattern you will have to figure out the pattern okay for making this and you just draw it and cut it out and make a box okay the size of this all right
and this is the same as the 1st one that you made last week before you added okay now after that okay pay attention please okay after that you are actually going to use this as a cover and this is a box so you cover this box and now it is a rectangular prism right
okay so again we are not looking at volume so not the inside but only on the outside the surface okay so let me just let me just help you start by looking at one of the surface one of the sides
so let us say the box you know it is like this simon right sides front back okay
so okay how can we find the surface or the area of this front this top side
jackie measure length from width length okay that is 6 centimeters 6 units and then 4 units this way many 33 units there are 24 not just units but square units okay
so 6 times 4 ah square units sense so now we took care of the top
sides how many sides are there in a rectangular prism sides 3666 right 66 top bottom 12 front back 34 side side 56 okay
so what you are going to do is you will make this box 1st and then i want you to write okay the top area figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom the area of the front side area of the back side the side one of the sides and then the other side okay mean we have found all the surfaces right
sides and then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism up you just add everything up and then you have the total surface area okay so why do not i have you start by making the top
so this is for pattern pattern for box one . okay yeah people will hook them we have like 15
and then can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way you okay does everyone have one more yes so use a pencil to to make the pattern
okay can you stop for a minute jackie okay so how many squares across how many units if you count from here how many 4 square units how many 4 right square units here is it also 4 square units
yes so is this going to match huh you make okay you need to make a pattern that is this size right okay and only one layer one unit high okay
good no that is 25s you all set judy
0 so here you just cut the corner is that right yeah okay that is fine you can do another one tape tape just tape the top and you do not have to tape the lid you know the cover
okay yeah just tape the side so you can cover this
okay do you remember we talked about this or the surface area of this whole rectangular prism
wait simon the area we are looking at
share because like right here if you put the cube in right this square and this square are the same square so they are part of the same cube cubes okay we are not doing cubes anymore
and this time simon it is just the surface just the surface this okay okay okay so remember surface area
area is just the surface not the inside okay that is a good point calculating okay write in your notebook just like the way i wrote on the board
so once you have your box boys and girls you can start figuring out the surface area of this box box it is just like counting all the squares around this box okay
2 right okay so that is why you did it twice okay and how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangle and then you have the surface surface area
good okay are you what are you working on
that is good okay so ming what is the strategy for finding the surface area
now all right so tell me how you can find the surface area or what is the surface area the top the area of the top you find it by multiplying the length by the width okay and why did you why do you have to multiply the length by the width
to figure out the area where is the area number what are these square units good
that means they are all these sides all together do well can you figure out this area of this side
this so once you have all 6 then then what do you do i do not know okay so let us see that in your notebook all right so let us put this aside and why do not you start writing hey boys and girls i need to see that in your notebook okay
area okay lawrence where is it put this book away
where is the surface area i do not know and you need to show me how you found 108 108 what units surface area is that a unit
okay all right are you all set
step if you have tape yes you can just take this corner all right okay samantha you know what is happening what are you what are what are you looking for now
are we doing this why are you adding why do you need to add those numbers and what is surface area
the area of the 3 dimensional shape okay kevin if you were to explain to someone what surface area is let us say you have this prism okay then what do you do it surface area is the area
surface all the sides and surface okay so how do you think you earlier you asked me whether you have to add the numbers right so do you have to add those
so once you have found 6 surfaces and then you just add them right and that is exactly what marlene just said good excuse me okay now if you were looking at this box like this right so where is the top
this is the top bottom front back right side and side sides and you can also look at it from this angle front and then what would the back be
right side and side right so depending on how you look at the box if you put it up this way then this would be the top okay
box and then figure out okay the front side back top bottom okay esther let me see your let us see
next we count the bottom area okay and what do you notice about the top and the bottom they are the same
me okay michael i want you to start figuring out the the answer and how did you get this number well at 1st i was looking at this then i do not think we can count it squares no
kevin did you write down the surface area and you showed how you found it okay
these okay well that works because you are looking for the surface of this whole thing right but what i would like you to do is to take this box like one side at a time so you calculate the area of this side this side this side this side this side and then what do you do at the end
red yes sir right there okay let us see okay very good all right okay maybe another minute
finish and then if you are done i would like you to write down okay listen in please to write down how you can calculate or find a surface area of a rectangular prism okay so if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find a surface area and what would you say
so i think most of you have found that the area of all the sides okay so how can we find the area the surface area or the area to all of these sides around this rectangular prism what is this you have to combine all the areas okay do you agree with that
area okay james
yes okay why is it important to say square units instead of units
mean you actually count squares number of squares so when we say cubic just like last week we count the number of okay so it is very important that you use the right unit okay now let us move on to the next one so cole what would the next one be
it marlene did you disagree no so is it wrong that it is 3 by 66 by 306 by 3 does it matter same okay now group one it how many people actually have 3 units by 6 units
units okay and do you get the same answer the same number of squares how many have something different for the front side
so this is your front side is that right joshua okay okay so simon please like it depends on the okay one at a time
it you could you could say you could like say this is the front as well you could like say this is the front this is the front okay and do you agree with him right and i drew this up here i say we are going to look at this box from this angle side but if you look at it from this way that is your front the front side right
also yeah okay all right so let us just keep this as the front side
kevin it is the same is that right yeah okay very good and then the side so this side and that side okay dylan what is the side or left side
this so what is that side or this side oops this side 03 by 4 okay
so 3 units by 4 units and that is 12 okay and then the last one okay selina
okay and that is 12 right okay and i asked you to write down how you find the total surface area
say lily coyne how can you find the total surface area these okay so now the surface area of this rectangular prism is
set yeah okay so let me give you another one to practice and you can use this box or you can draw a box okay so for this 11st of all i am going to have you find the volume
prism okay wait a minute
i have to draw what i want you to draw the prism and then i want you to find the volume okay we have been practicing finding volumes right
yeah so earlier we said that we can find one layer and then multiply it by the number of layers right so what is that bottom layer hold 44 okay now remember we are going back to volume so the number of cubes you can put inside
0 without this 12 so now there are 2 layers
24 right so volume is 24 cubic inches that is good and now you are going to think about the surface area okay
so remember to label the numbers rachel labeling 0 you labeled with number but what about the units
mean the number of cubes we can put inside right
are we supposed to just leave the numbers without labels and then what i would like you to do is to find see if you can find an easier way to find the surface area instead of finding the top and then the bottom and the front and the back way i think there is
times okay if you want to look at this 2 times 4 is 2 times 2 times that and then times 28 no no no 2 times one and then like easy like these 2 numbers you times them so which is 8 and you do 8 for the next one as well okay you do times 2 times 3 which is 64 times 3 12 times 12
and instead of finding it 2 times you know you just find once and then multiply by 2 good so maybe you can try to write a formula okay those people who finished see if you can write a formula for finding a surface area that instead of doing 6 steps and then add is there an easier way
so you can do 4 times 2 times 2 so but that is only 3 steps okay i have got the answer good so so you do not have to repeat that right because it okay very good can you write a formula just write it down
0 so the formula is i would be just adding just multiplying it out numbers they are the same right yeah and so are these you see
formula i can not yet write a formula if you can write a formula to find surface area something that is easier you know than doing one side at a time
you could do top times top plus front plus right times 2 i did it so top area plus front area plus right area times 2
now we are looking for surface area i figured out an easier way okay because if you know the top area is 6 times 4 you do not have to do the bottom because it is going to be the same so you go the sides and both sides and front and back and then left and right okay so if you only find one of them and then double multiply by 2 then you find okay very good
yes it is like one is over here and then the other side right very good very good boys and girls it is almost time for us to go so but we will come back after gym i am sorry okay so when we come back excuse me listen okay so i would like you to think about a way or a formula or a shorter way an easier way to find surface area
okay and then when we come back we will have a few more minutes before lunch and then we can talk about that okay
so and for homework okay i do have more of these rectangular prisms simon for you to go home and find and practice finding surface area okay so why do not you just leave everything here and then line up quietly
so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0
1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20
right so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say 0 my account is negative that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had
so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30 $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game golf but also like video games sometimes right
i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah
thermometer we talked yesterday about the thermometer right right this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right this side has fahrenheit and celsius and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what
do you remember what the celsius is when it is 32 degrees fahrenheit it is what temperature in the celsius temperature freezing temperature of water that is right 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and we talked about what was that average human body temperature 212 i think it was
212 boiling water boiling of water right and then we talked about bath water is about 110 okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right but some people still have these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you
some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water it it shows the temperature there right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right
and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer during what season right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers so going back to the chart it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer we just talked about that
numbers so how many of you watch golf do any of you golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3 or 4 easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole
score what did you say one because there it was expected you would need 4 strokes hitting the ball 4 times to get the ball in the hole one and the more the higher your negative number the better you are doing because that is how many strokes under par so if you did exactly 4 strokes if it took you 4 times hitting the ball to get it into the hole you would be on par which means your score would be 0
if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par
okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right long all year long
location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long yep california and miami we noticed they had warmer temperatures matter and the poles right pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay
so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time off so i am going to start out by showing you the game board so this game is called number line tug of war
all right i want you to look at this think about what you think the object of the game might be yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game
game what do you think but how how are you going to win here so talk to your partner
table orion why do not you go to table 3 and table 4 go to table 4 isaiah come over here
segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
because i accidentally just pressed something and i do not know if i turned it off yes so i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again is that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something
so well i do not want to press it again in case it is nothing is think about this says team one this says team 2 stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no
do where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner
that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do
paperclips you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay stars why do you think there is one star over here and another star .
no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place what positive number 10 right over here what are you trying to get to negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right
ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right numbers okay one of the things that we need to do on here
right so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light game well yes but i am talking about with the number line right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10 label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right
0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers let us label the other side
here -one -one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0 and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10
numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners
okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner then team one puts the paperclip right on 0 paperclips so we start team one at 0
0 you always have to keep in mind your goal 10 team 2 is trying to get to -10 and obviously whoever reaches their goal 1st is going to win right where 2 different teams are getting to opposite end zones right
2 now they have 12 steps to try and get over that was a good question yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2
up you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right if they are trying to get that way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right
what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10 attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop
all right so i think we will just divide the class in half
1st you can roll for spin for team 11st up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right good so i need someone from team 2
nicely so now what should your team be thinking -negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
come here segala you forgot to move your game piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left next yep 0
+3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place
up all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are up remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game move so you would go 0 that is one
12 okay good job remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right over be a positive okay +one
go okay jasmine come on up
we are at +2 where should she end up at if she got 0 good remember from 2 to one is one he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012
patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you yes 0 nathan come on up
minute if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line 10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal at 0 okay so team one
isaiah your hand was up 1st so be careful walking around the camera oops so you got -30 wait you are going to move your piece
good uhh bobby go so remember you are thinking negative right
so okay hi remember we are going to try and stay quiet and focus on the game
one so what do you have to do 3 they are moving one so you are at -2
2 she did spin it 2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment so right now let us stop for a minute
to negative not -10 so someone on this front team can you tell me how many spaces away are you from -10 right now yes what then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers
yet yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down get 33 then you just move up one and you have won
up let us see time that is +2 +2 yeah hold on
wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 very good
up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is
up uhh i hope everyone is listening up anaya come on up
focus remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up arnina and davina i know 0 and aaron ready -3 very good
you are at 5 so where are you going to go to up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening
go hey up .
up excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now
move hey kobe come on up piece very good
okay 0 tire will be next too remember alicia is team one so they are trying to get to +10 right -3
all right wait you got to move it alicia we got negative okay we will play the game for a couple more minutes and then at that point if we have not gotten anywhere we will look to see who is closest to their goal and that team will be the winner all right +one not -one +one go hey aaron come on up
table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3 wait a minute yes so you are at -3 good okay michael come on up
yep +3 it uhh jasmine come on up quietly i like the way some people are sitting up
nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward
he had +one yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward
5 very good up come on rocco so +one come here michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help
so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom segala come on up
okay okay noisha come on up
2 okay it is almost 10 0 and at that time i wanted to start you playing partners so we have enough time for 2 more people to come up and spin one so anthony come on up one so +2
angel i mean tire angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin
7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here board we said we were stopping the game here now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10
alexandra cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so goal 3 how far is team 2 from their goal 18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner
game yes i think i think this game is rigged do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch
need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips place obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right
foe yes that why so
pair quickly you 2 will play and .
who will kobe will play with bobby you are going to be team one and kobe will be team 2 and then you will switch you are not worrying about the other people at the table so alexander you will play with segala
i want to see does everyone have the materials they need yes anthony go give them right where do you need to start your game pieces
10 what is team 2 is goal i am asking you a question doing 0 bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line
good do not forget to label your number line
numbers label your number line please do you remember to label your number line
line i did not do that correctly angel there is no reason to get that loud what is the problem bradley no we need another paper clip you have another one
desk make the minus
be you are going to make sure be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
do go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet good whoa whoa whoa where were you
-3 nice you seem like 5 minutes
let me hold it for now you finished
2 so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10 yes when when i was with the spin orion accidentally put it up and it flanked okay so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior lesson you need to focus on what you are doing yes
right team if you were team one now you will be team 21 how is it going on the bottom okay fine yeah
once when you are being +10 or -10 anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
negative where are you now so how many places away are you from your goal
10 if you have to go 10 to 0 and then -10 to -10
what is this for i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now
no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at -0 my
123 let us see who is listening paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game
i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair
so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0
1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20
right so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say 0 my account is negative that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had
so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30 $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game golf but also like video games sometimes right
i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah there are negative numbers on a thermometer
we talked yesterday about the thermometer right right this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right celsius and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what

212 boiling water boiling of water right and then we talked about bath water is about 110 okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you
some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right
and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers
that in golf there are scores with negative numbers golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3 or 4 easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole

if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay
negative temperatures are cold temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right long all year long location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long
yep california and miami we noticed they had warmer temperatures matter and the poles right pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner
okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time off so i am going to start out by showing you the game board war so
no all right i want you to look at this think about what you think the object of the game might be yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game
game what do you think but how how are you going to win look at what you have here so talk to your partner
table orion why do not you go to table 3 and table 4 go to table 4 isaiah come over here
segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
off yes so i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something
so well i do not want to press it again in case it is nothing is think about this says team one this says team 2 you see stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no
do where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner
that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do
paperclips you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay stars why do you think there is one star over here and another star .
no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place what positive number 10 right over here what are you trying to get to negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right
ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right numbers okay one of the things that we need to do on here
right so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light game well yes but i am talking about with the number line right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10 label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right
0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers
one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0 and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10
numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners
okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner paperclips so we start team one at 0
0 you always have to keep in mind your goal 10 team 2 is trying to get to -10 and obviously whoever reaches their goal 1st is going to win right where 2 different teams are getting to opposite end zones right
2 now they have 12 steps to try and get over that was a good question yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2
up you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right if they are trying to get that way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right
what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10
attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop
up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right good so i need someone from team 2 nicely so now what should your team be thinking
-negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
come here segala you forgot to move your game piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left next yep 0
+3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place
up all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are up remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game
112 okay good job remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right over be a positive okay +one
go okay jasmine come on up
we are at +2 where should she end up at if she got 0 good remember from 2 to one is one he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012
patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you up what score does team one need to win
10 wait a minute stop for a minute if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line 10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal okay so team one
isaiah your hand was up 1st so be careful walking around the camera oops so you got -30 wait you are going to move your piece on the line very good
uhh bobby wait a minute let me see who has not come up in the front row go so remember you are thinking negative right so okay
yet orion come on up hi game so +one do yeah so wait a minute you are on -3
they are moving one so you are at -2 okay who has not come up on this side
2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment minute team 2 is at +5 right to negative not -10 so someone on this front team can you tell me how many spaces away are you from -10 right now
yes what then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers
yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down get 33 then you just move up one and you have won
up let us see time that is +2 +2 yeah hold on
wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 good okay who has not come up yet on this
up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is
up uhh i hope everyone is listening up anaya come on up
focus remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up arnina and davina i know 0 and aaron ready so you are going to try and get a negative
good you are at 5 so where are you going to go to up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening
hey all right bobby come on up
up excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now
move hey kobe come on up piece very good okay 0 tire will be next
up and aaron aaron you will be up next too
up table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3 wait a minute yes so you are at -3 good okay michael come on up
yep +3 it uhh jasmine come on up quietly i like the way some people are sitting up
nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward
he had +one yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward
10 +3 good brad move it good hey rocco come on up
come on rocco so +one come here michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that
so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom segala come on up 0 that is okay okay noisha come on up
one so anthony come on up one so +2 angel i mean tire
angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin
7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here board we said we were stopping the game here now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10
alexandra cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so goal 3 how far is team 2 from their goal 18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner
game yes i think i think this game is rigged do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips
you are going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right yes another way you could say it is rival
that why so
favor can you pass out 3 paperclips to each pair quickly you 2 will play and you and are they up here yes
who will kobe will play with bobby you are going to be team one and kobe will be team 2 and then you will switch you are not worrying about the other people at the table so alexander you will play with segala
yes anthony go give them right where do you need to start your game pieces
10 what is team 2 is goal i am asking you a question doing 0 bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line
good do not forget to label your number line numbers label your number line please do you remember to label your number line
line i did not do that correctly angel there is no reason to get that loud what is the problem bradley no we need another paper clip you have another one
desk make the minus
be you are going to make sure be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
do go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet
let me hold it for now you finished
2 so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10 yes when when i was with the spin orion accidentally put it up and it flanked okay so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior lesson you need to focus on what you are doing yes
right team if you were team one now you will be team 21 how is it going on the bottom okay fine yeah
once when you are being +10 or -10 anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
but that shows that you can win when you are negative where are you you are moving in the wrong direction right now
i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now
no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at -0 my
123 let us see who is listening paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game
i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line operations okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair
okay my math goals reader can you please read the math goals for today
friday what did you learn about decimals you can go back into your notes if you need to what did you learn about decimals or what do you know about decimals tan decimal is the fraction that is small decimal is a fraction please class what else do you know about decimals
ban fraction is the number of the smaller so the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction if you have more zeros the smaller the fraction so the smaller the decimal
decimals it is like money it is like money what do you mean you what do you mean it is like money thinking we gave an example on friday about money
that what do you mean it is like money
money exxon that the decimal you use it for money like the decimal you use it for money and other stuff so you are trying to help tiffany out
money thank you we talked about it on friday friday i can not hear you
louder we talked about a quarter and how is that like a decimal
dollar good and one more person tao a decimal is like it represents a fraction and a short way of words so it is like a fraction and it is a short way of words
mean like it represents a fraction so you think it is a shorter way of writing a fraction maybe not shorter but different right okay so who remembers this from friday this so decimal is a number with a decimal point in it
tiffany all the digits to the left of the decimal represents whole numbers 0 these are all whole numbers because they are to the left of the decimal all the numbers to the right of the decimal represent the actual decimal the actual fractional piece number ritchie 52 and how would i say that number
5200th good do not forget the 6 and 6 and 52 before 5252 what decimal 52 what okay let us try to put the whole thing together
6.526 and yourself 65200 we are missing something time 6 and 5200th good
5 tenths 5 tenths when it is a 0 you will need to say 0
no 100th 100th very nice excellent so today we are going to be comparing decimals but 1st i want you to write down this number and what each place value is so the 2 is in the 1000s place place the 6 in the 10s the 4 in the ones and then we have our decimal
so the 5 is in the tenths place and the 7 is in the hundredths place now remember when you are saying your decimal numbers to cover your mouth because you may end up spitting on the person in front of you okay i want to make sure i hear that part on now you do not have to copy it the way that you see it
one more minute no sneezing bless you you got it ritchie let me see
here 10 seconds okay you alright you seem a little scared you okay
you do not let it scare you do not worry it is not going anywhere okay okay okay are we ready thing okay alrighty if you did not finish you can copy from the person sitting next to you
so in your groups i have several numbers here underlined i want you to tell me what place is it in place is it in the hundredths place
minutes work as a group
as a group so far all i hear is tao trying to work with her group but i do not hear any other groups trying to work with each other not independently do not copy it
it did we talk about this or did you just put this down on your notebook did you talk about it with hannah tee and magnolia
it can we talk about it
agree where is the decimal right after here right what is the place that comes after the decimal 1010s and after that in 100 so this is why you guys need to have a discussion about it
1000s wendy thinks this is the 1000s place
this the decimal is here and where is it okay the decimal is right here yeah and the number is here so .
this before decimal what place is this ones so this would be the .
be ones did you tell me which one reaches in
do i do not see it there i do not know how to do it where is the decimal am i pointing to it
decimal one so what would this be be 10 it seems like you are having trouble working with a group and that can not happen here all of you that is not fair that you are in a group yet you want to be selfish and not share your knowledge with anybody else
group to work together to work together and to help each other that are any of you actually doing that no so that means you are not following my directions how not by ourselves right now
together okay 2 more minutes to finish this up and then we are going to go over each one what do you think exxon do you agree with all your choices
the 4 or the 6 the 6 this is the hundredths why are the arrows pointing towards the wrong number
answers if we are working together we do not have the same answer what do you think tiffany is what do you think tee so how is it possible that if i ask you to work together you all have different answers
possible tell hannah why you think it is the ones place
hannah where is your decimal where is your decimal what is the place before the decimal also 100s and hundredths are spelled very differently
so this if you are saying hundredths it would be wrong because you are spelling 100s ds all right let us go over this one who can come up here and label what place the 6 is in
one pass it to somebody else thumbs up if we agree with tan
do not come on missus embry are you trying to say the same place as exxon or a different place
place same place so you see how he spelled his
place do not forget this side of the room
disagree hang on let us see who agrees and who disagrees okay good come on tiffany look at that they are clapping for you and everything alrighty thumbs up if we agree with tiffany that it is in the 100s place disagree okay let us practice saying these numbers
one hannah can you say it a little bit louder 4 and 600s 4 and 600s sounds good to me what about this one magnolia
6064 and 18 tenths magnolia says 64 and 18 tenths so think about what the last thing you just said was
is 1818 what hundredths all right let us try that again 64 and 18 hundredths beautiful 64 and 18 hundredths and the next one glendy
4 and 6 hundredths what number is this 6 what number is this 1616 what 100s let us try that again
4 and 16 hundredths 4 and 16 hundredths the next one tee 5 and 83 hundredths 5 and 83 hundredths and last but not least exxon 5 and 13 hundredths 5 and 13 hundredths i love it i love it alrighty so today we are going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another you are going to be using charts
i am going to give 2 to each group these charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another what does it mean to compare what do you think i mean when i mean to compare decimals think about your goals for today your objective for today
decimals i will wait because the witnesses seem a little distracted so i will ask my question again compare when you compare numbers what do you do magnolia compare not quite exxon 10th she just said the same thing and i said not quite numbers magnolia can you read the goal again for a language objective
so i told everyone to start with decimals r s m greater than and equal to so i will ask you again doing only tao knows
exxon fang what do you think i am going to be asking you to do
listening students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than and equal to one another so what do you think you are going to be doing you compare the decimals what does it mean to compare
go back to my initial question tee to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller or equal to another decimal right decimals you are going to be seeing whether they are smaller bigger or equal to each other and i want you to use those charts to help you figure it out as a group
alright does everyone have those charts okay so we are going to play a group war and how this works is i am going to give you some time to think about it to think about the numbers by yourself and then you are going to share with your group what you are thinking
leader this leader is going to share their thinking with the class trick each group needs to be prepared to share because you never know which group is going to get called on
alright and 2 groups will be getting called on which means you have to tell me whether you agree or disagree with each other practice this is a practice round so i already pre selected these decimals
so the decimals that you are comparing is 110th and 12 hundredths you want to tell me if 110th is less than greater than or equal to 12 hundredths you are going to think about it by yourself for 30 seconds 1st and then when i tell you to share your thoughts with your group that is when you are going to share with your group
okay and then i am going to have group one and group 2 193 jabdiel is group is usually here
right he is 3 so group one would be inspectors be we do not have a 17
15 tiffany is group alright so then inspectors will be talking 1st about what they think and then tiffany is group will be talking about if they agree or disagree with what fang said
go group one goes 1st and then group 2 will follow toes so at this point i want you to pick your leader for your group
me witnesses who is your leader leader beautiful okay we are ready so remember i am going to give you 30 seconds to think about it by yourself and then you are going to share your thinking with your leader
so your leader is going to take all the knowledge that you have given him plus or her plus their own and have a discussion about it ready okay so here is the 1st 2 cards
remember you can use that chart that i gave you to help you compare them maybe you want to color in 67 hundredths and color in 5 tenths to see which one is greater okay now i want you to discuss it as a group i will give you about one to 2 minutes to discuss it
you need to tell me why is it bigger why is it smaller why is it equal to the other number
her okay let us see which group is group one
2 okay let us see who is up 1st group 2 thinking come on
i think 6700 again louder because you are talking to that group
you we agree because we also think 6700 is bigger 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths natan said something interesting true is that true
do you remember exxon is cake on friday that we cut it said i know what you meant but hundredths is not bigger than tenths mean okay and what do you guys think
do you agree with these 2 groups that 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths it so on the charts they actually colored in the 5 tenths and the 6700 bigger exxon hundredths can you say the number
6700 so the 6700 is closer to a whole correct round okay so this is 30 seconds of wait time
so you can think about it and write it down in your notebooks and be prepared to share your thoughts in 30 seconds
can you repeat what he said gwendy gwendy was not listening to you ethan mean say it again and then repeat after him
did not did you color in 5 tenths correctly 14 tenths and 4th 800s okay i thought you colored in the old one
no okay let us see whose group won
one we do not have that
okay are we ready 1st group one you are up 1st i think . louder fight i know exxon he loves to argue
with i agree with group 2 you agree with group 2 in i like that tiffany keeps using graphic representations because it helps prove your point a little bit better right she also colored in 40 hundredths where do they stop
place yes so 4 tenths is still 6 tenths away from a whole and 40 hundredths is 60 hundredths away from a whole 2 alrighty and one more round
ready i told you exxon is going to aruge it is a hard one it is a hard one because we have not talked about thousandths yet
because if you add another 0 to the 222 hundredths and there is like a 5 over there and 5 is bigger than the 0 so i think it is like part 2 is bigger than part 2
wow what do you think i think it is closer to part 2 why
because ritchie what do you think idea alrighty it is my favorite part are we ready let us see who group one is
think can you speak louder tiffany we think it is part 2 because we think part 2 is what
that let us see what the other group thinks we agree that the answer is part 2
2 what answer 00 i mean 220 is is bigger than 2200 why think about what tao said
because if you add a 0 to 200 still the 5 will be bigger than 0 so what number would this be 200 200000s and this would be 225000 which one of those is bigger
225000 225000 is bigger than 220000 right also so you are just bringing me on to what i was going to explain to you so let us go back to these 2 decimals that we talked about earlier
sometimes you do not even need a graphic representation to help you figure out how to compare decimals the 1st thing you do is you line up your decimals so that they are one on top of the other
compare then we look at our ones place place and
and what is the number in my tenths place no what about in the 100s place magnolia 11 and
compare yes or no bigger therefore this number is bigger than 5 so 27 hundredths is bigger than 25 hundredths okay
so now what i want you to do is i want you to look at the back of the room i have 2 decimals on the board 37 hundredths and 4 tenths i want you to tell me if it is less than greater than or equal to in your notebooks by yourself
i am coming i am coming is it less than greater than or equal to
this is bigger than this use this use those charts to help you
where is yours okay
which one is bigger good it is a weird looking symbol okay who wants to share their thinking who wants to share their thinking
so far i have walked around and i think i like what i see 0.37 how do we say that number 37 hundredths hundredths good
it is greater than 4 tenths and 4 hundredths and 4 hundredths it is greater than 0.37 you said 0.37 is greater than 4 tenths is that what you mean to say
number exxon i respectfully disagree because if you put the 7 to the 4 that will be bigger you can not just add 7s 0 okay and which one of those is bigger 47 hundredths what is this number
40 hundredths okay if you think that this number is smaller stand up mind i said that 4 hundredths is bigger than 0.37
you know what you said at 1st that 0.37 is bigger than 4 tenths
correct 37 hundredths is smaller than 4 tenths bigger and she said 4 tenths is bigger because 4 is bigger than 3 and she is correct
and before we talk about anything i want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions fractions what do you know about fractions it is when like a square .
okay when a square is broken up into 4 and a few are shaded in that is a fraction see what else do we know about fractions the top number is the denominator and bottom is the numerator okay let us think about that for a minute fractions the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the .
the denominator okay what else do we know about fractions does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole hold on one sec there is fraction that you can do with a half or a whole no i said that fractions have to do with . 0 they have to do with a half or whole okay
who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape
okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute is valid or what what we are saying is true have there is a certain way to write the to write it down there is a certain way to write it down okay alright lots of information
thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay
whole we could call it a region
okay it is part of that whole or region a fraction is also a part of a group of things things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it
fractions you are going to take an equal part whole how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions
you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want half one line in the middle right in the middle okay
side and an equal amount on the other side number of pieces
222 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the denominator denominator okay right that is the denominator the number of pieces i shaded in .
whole i cut into 2 equal pieces ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see .
half one half and one half right one half here one half here set how many are there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 66 and i .
jellybeans and i am hungry this afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry nu or my fraction is 3 out of 6
fat okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in number is the one that you shaded in pieces or the number in the set or the group
the top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about number the number of pieces in your whole number out of the whole set out of the group
 if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards match your vocabulary word meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish it is kind of like go fish down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match
yep numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction
here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
yes yes okay here is one half the circle and here is the other half not so 3 sixths is the same as half they are the same thing okay they are equivalent fractions
region whoops sorry okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i pieces and i am going to do the same thing i am going to color in half what sixths and how many did i color in
caitlin or it could be like 48s 48s is an equivalent faction it is half of the set 4 is half of 83 is half of 6 ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then
half 3 sixths somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is 10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another 11020s 10 twentieths yes absolutely great job
 51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent w .
half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are area or they name the same part of a set
a a region or a whole that is not a fraction this is not a fraction a equal lateral whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of .
half quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter how many quarters is that
part a mixed number is a fract a whole number and a fraction fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number number who can give me another mixed number a whole number and a fraction
 and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number fraction give me a mixed number 5 and one .
3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good
and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way number okay an improper fractions has a larger numerator .
2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what how many halves is it
them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah yes number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half
0 and there are 12345 halves these are the same okay i think the only other fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the .
okay because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year
that is another one i am going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions here okay
 vocabulary cards look vocabulary cards okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice
addition and subtraction there is extra paper right in the back here can i just borrow that honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st already turn the question around into your answers okay
so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences okay jaylon yep pass out paper to these 6 people right here in this center
okay do not forget to ttqa alright okay okay so carefully to the back table with a pencil yes makenzie you may use the bathroom now honey
carefully to the back table with a pencil what can i go to the bathroom yep go quick and come back quick what is it ashley never mind you all set okay alright do not forget you are working .
alright yes please use your problem solving skills dear i hit my arm now it is feeling like now it feels like it went to sleep
okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper
okay somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that fraction what is a fraction it is a .
a whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart
okay let us say that our hershey is bar okay can you imagine that in your head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here
 this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but okay
i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in
now if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces 33 so what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator
what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3 yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word it numerator one more time
numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the of 6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
say it again the numerator michael you say it
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it 6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you denominator good denominator denominator perfect so .
eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another 3 sixths equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes
alright so we have rectangular paper right this is going to be our region or our whole okay
rectangle what does it tell us the dimensions of a rectangle are what are the dimensions of your rectangle makenzie what are the dimensions of the rectangle
there is not 6 pieces anymore are there no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy 644 by 6
on sit up straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6 right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie and only makenzie okay alright if i were to find .
see let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here
half over here okay so i have got one half here and one half here alright so we have got this huge candy bar we just cut it in half right how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half
i i cut it exactly i do not know if i cut it exactly in half beautiful job excellent explanation absolutely right 12 why is your hand raised honey i do not know i do not either let us let us count each half and make sure there is 12 in each half
yours 456789101112 on one side and i know if there is 12 on one side . there has to be 12 on the other side because 12 +12 equals 2424 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in
conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares
no we did not okay am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount pieces okay now are we all on the same page now
now i cut my candy bar in half get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units
24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way paper i want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half
christian no christian does not like chocolate both michael and ayana get equal number of pieces go ahead go to your next rectangle go to your next rectangle nope i want halves i want to see halves go to your next rectangle
way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar
paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one half and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar
way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing
because if they are not something needs to be done about it isaac what is wrong nothing okay
okay let us see if we found a different way
it vertically up and down in half he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half picture he cut it in half i know there is 1224681012 here so there must be 24681012 here the there you need to write the .
the how many squares are in that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in
bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way
we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
way yeah i did mine diagonally did you label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job count let us .
question who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half
no yes absolutely good look at me nice job nice job
half and on the bottom you would write one half
half let me ask you a question 0 sit down please ayana it is not a talent show it is not a fashion show have a seat alright yes christian said well what about diagonally the other way would that work
yeah absolutely okay would it be like possible to like make a circle and then hm probably not a circle probably not a circle question can we put the plus sign how many small squares in each half half 12 thank you michael
why because 12 +12 equals 24 alright so if you have 24 small squares in one side half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half .
yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2 and there is 8 and there is and there is watch
 2 how much do we have to split it in
absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
it 0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles so what do you think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other
i challenge you did you make sure that you counted and there are 12 in each side
i know one where is wait where is you one half anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
be right back how we doing girls good how is this group doing good you doing okay huh where is is savannah your group yeah nice job
win yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time yeah who won 0 congratulations yeah i got like 4 okay i kept on guessing but i got it .
set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed it said something it said something that is on the top that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator
down did everybody check each other is work all flip them all over right now and just match them for me so i can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are okay flip em all over
me 0 that is awesome yes alright let us see yours okay so 1st .
each yeah awesome and which which other ones 123456789101112 nice job christian
one everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper
a whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals one see 123456789101112 nice job ayana
ayana is 12 good work one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you seat and there is even 12 in this .
okay and the other halves did you make another one you makenzie i am not sure what you are doing over there but you are you are i made 2 .
made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay christian no it is not because you have made .
look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece 0 it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
11234567891011 twelfths nice job 12s what did i say 12 square units easy this it is easier than way easy
this is not half sweetheart halves are 2 pieces to make one whole you have got more than 2 pieces here right
go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit here okay on where show me
under i do not see the halves did you do this boom boom boom boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see
cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table seat that is okay that is alright it is okay
you can use halves but it has to equal 12 square units so this only equals 12345 wholes and a half is 612 this you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next nicholas are you all set
up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now
nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay
sec but do not we need different numbers listen if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2 cause the denominator is going to be 4
you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch you made halves like this
yes i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them
6 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into right do we have a number yep we do alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me
that is hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i .
i just made a new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 1234567891011120 right here okay i see that now
good job makenzie excellent excellent you got halves and you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here fourths makenzie here you go honey i do not know what is going on here but i am center lovely kay guys
but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction i i put my chair back and it hit the desk did he injure you in any way
do you have to write how you figured it out or can you do it on this paper because it says to .
job yep bring do you have all your matches together
okay a number that has a whole number and a fraction form what is that called mixed number oops
and before we talk about anything i want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions
okay when a square is broken up into 4 and a few are shaded in that is a fraction fractions the top number is the denominator and bottom is the numerator okay let us think about that for a minute fractions the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the .
the denominator okay what else do we know about fractions does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole hold on one sec there is fraction that you can do with a half or a whole no i said that fractions have to do with . 0 they have to do with a half or whole okay
who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape
okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute is valid or what what we are saying is true have there is a certain way to write the okay alright lots of information
thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay
whole we could call it a region what else could we call it
region a fraction is also a part of a group of things things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it
fractions you are going to take an equal part whole how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions
you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want half one line in the middle right in the middle okay
side and an equal amount on the other side number of pieces
222 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the denominator denominator denominator the number of pieces i shaded in .
whole i cut into 2 equal pieces ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see .
half one half and one half right one half here one half here there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 66 and i .
afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry nu or my fraction is 3 out of 6
fat okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in number is the one that you shaded in pieces or the number in the set or the group
the top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about number the number of pieces in your whole number out of the whole set out of the group
 if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards match your vocabulary word meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish it is kind of like go fish
down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match here your vocabulary words are numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think
equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
yes yes okay here is one half the circle and here is the other half not so 3 sixths is the same as thing okay they are equivalent fractions region whoops sorry
okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i pieces and i am going to do the same thing i am going to color in half what sixths and how many did i color in
caitlin or it could be like 48s 48s is an equivalent faction it is half of the set 4 is half of 83 is half of 6 is ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then
half 3 sixths somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is 10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another one
 51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job okay you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions that is the question i was going to ask what if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent w .
half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are area or they name the same part of a set
a a region or a whole that is not a fraction fraction this is that region of that whole piece a equal lateral whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of .
okay half and half quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter how many quarters is that
part a mixed number is fract a whole number and a fraction fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number and a fraction that is called a mixed number who can give me another mixed number
 and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number fraction give me a mixed number 5 and one half good 5 and one half
mean 3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good
and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
it okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way number okay an improper fractions has numerator over a smaller denominator
2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what how many halves is it
them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah yes number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half
0 and there are 12345 halves same 2.5 and 5 halves got it okay i think the only other vocabulary words you need to know fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the .
okay because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year
okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions here okay
 vocabulary cards look okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice
addition and subtraction there is extra paper right in the back here can i just borrow that just the top part honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st already turn the question around into your answers
okay so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer okay jaylon you hold this one it goes right here yep pass out paper to these 6 people right here in this center
okay do not forget to ttqa alright okay here you are coming back with me 1st okay so carefully to the back table with a pencil
honey carefully to the back table with a pencil what can i go to the bathroom yep go quick and come back quick what is it ashley never mind you all set okay alright do not forget you are working .
alright yes please use your problem solving skills
okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other
quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper okay somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that
fraction what is a fraction it is a .
whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart
okay let us say that our hershey is bar head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here
 this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but okay
i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in
now if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator
what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3 yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word it numerator one more time
numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the of 6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
3 is the numerator yep do not star .
cause if you get them mixed up here and you and read a paper that says what number is the numerator you really need to know which one is which okay
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it 6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you denominator good denominator denominator perfect so .
eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes
alright so we have rectangular paper right this is going to be our region or our whole okay
we are going to take our 1st rectangle what what are the dimensions of a rectangle
well 4 times 4 times 6 for by 6 okay 4 times 6 or 4 by 6
there is not 6 pieces anymore are there no no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy .
644 by 64 times 6 straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6 right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces
i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie okay alright if i were to find .
see let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here
half over here okay so i have got one half here and one half here alright so we have got this huge candy bar we just cut it in half half how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half
i do not know if that is the right line i do not if i i cut it exactly i do not know if i cut it exactly in half beautiful job excellent explanation absolutely right
so let us count and make sure each side has 12 why is your hand raised honey i do not know i do not either let us let us count each half and make sure there is 12 in each half yours 456789101112 on one side and i know if there is 12 on one side . there has to be 12 on the other side
because 12 +12 equals 2424 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil
right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares no we did not okay am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount
pieces okay now okay almost now i cut my candy bar in half
get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units
24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way half look at your look at your paper i want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half
christian no christian does not like chocolate both michael and ayana get equal number of pieces go ahead go to your next rectangle go to your next rectangle nope i want halves i want to see halves go to your next rectangle
way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar
see i want to see another way to make one half on your paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one half and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar
way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing because if they are not something needs to be done about it wrong nothing
okay okay
vertically up and down in half he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half picture he cut it in half i know there is 1224681012 here so there must be 24681012 here what is wrong 0 the .
that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in
bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did
wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job count let us .
question who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half
no yes absolutely good look at me nice job
half let me ask you a question 0 sit down please ayana it is not a talent show it is not a fashion show have a seat alright yes christian said well what about diagonally the other way would that work yeah absolutely okay
would it be like possible to like make a circle and then hm probably not a circle probably not a circle now let me ask you a question can we put the plus sign how many small squares in each half half 12 thank you michael 12 here and 12 here why
because 12 +12 equals 24 alright so if you have 24 small squares in one side half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2
and there is 8 and there is and there is watch 2 how much do we have to split it in
absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other
you did you make sure that you counted
i know one where is wait where is you one half i do not see that you separated this rectangle anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
be right back how we doing girls good how is this group doing good you doing okay huh where is is savannah your group yeah nice job did you guys go through the cards once
win yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time yeah who won
set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed it said something it said something that is on the top that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator
what is a benchmark well where are your what are your matches down did everybody check each other is work all flip them all over right now and just match them for me so i can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are okay flip em all over
me i did this yay me 0 that is awesome yes alright let us see yours okay so 1st .
each yeah awesome and which ones 123456789101112 nice job christian
one everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper
a whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals one see 123456789101112 nice job ayana
ayana is 12 good work one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you
okay and the other halves did you make another one you makenzie i am not sure what you are doing over there but you are you are i made 2 .
made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay christian no it is not because you have made .
look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
11234567891011 twelfths nice job half this is way easy i am so glad that it is way easy this it is easier than way easy this is not half sweetheart halves are 2 pieces to make one whole
go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit here okay i did one hold on
i do not under i do not see the halves did you do this boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see no cause if you do .
alright you guys listen how many people i need you to sit down ayana but you know what cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table seat that is okay that is alright it is okay
sharing okay what do we do
you can use halves but it has to equal 12 square units so this only equals 12345 wholes and a half is 6 that is only 6 square units not 12 this you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next set all set
up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now
down to fill the rest of these nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay
sec but do not we need different numbers listen if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2 cause the denominator is going to be 4
you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch watch you made halves like this right yes
i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them
6 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into do alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me
that is hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i .
new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 1234567891011120 right here okay i see that now
good job makenzie excellent excellent you got halves and you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here fourths makenzie here you go honey i do not know what is going on here but i am center lovely kay guys
but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction
do you have to write how you figured it out or can you do it on this paper because it says to .
yep okay i told this group to bring together let us see if they isaac
okay a number that has a whole number and a fraction form what is that called mixed number oops
okay my math goals reader can you please read the math goals for today students will be able to compare decimals using graphic representation
excellent students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than . and and equal to one another very nice okay so what do we know about decimals so far
friday what did you learn about decimals you can go back into your notes if you need to what did you learn about decimals or what do you know about decimals tan
decimal is the fraction that is small decimal is a fraction please class what else do you know about decimals ban fraction is the number of the smaller so the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction if you have more zeros the smaller the fraction so the smaller the decimal good anything else
tiffany what did you learn about decimals it is like money it is like money what do you mean you what do you mean it is like money thinking we gave an example on friday about money
money thank you we talked about it on friday do you remember the example we gave on friday you you are right i can not hear you though
louder we talked about a quarter and how is that like a decimal dollar so it is a fraction of a dollar good and one more person tao
right okay so who remembers this from friday this so decimal is a number with a decimal point in it i think that is what you mean for money tiffany all the digits to the left of the decimal represents whole numbers
0 these are all whole numbers because they are to the left of the decimal all the numbers to the right of the decimal represent the actual decimal the actual fractional piece number ritchie 52 and how would i say that number 5200th good do not forget the 6 let us try to say the whole thing 6 and
and 6 and 52 what you said before 5252 what 6.526 and 52 okay by yourself
65200 we are missing something 65200th one more time 6 and 5200th good
okay you just say 5 tenths tricky
no 100th 100th very nice excellent so today we are going to be comparing decimals but 1st i want you to write down this number and what each place value is so the 2 is in the 1000s place
place the 6 in the 10s the 4 in the ones and then we have our decimal so the 5 is in the tenths place and the 7 is in the hundredths place now remember when you are saying your decimal numbers to cover your mouth because you may end up spitting on the person in front of you okay i want to make sure i hear that part
on now you do not have to copy it the way that you see it
if it is easier for you you can put 1000s on top of the 200s on top of the one whichever way is easier for you to remember
one more minute no sneezing bless you you got it ritchie let me see
so in your groups i have several numbers here you see where each number is underlined i want you to tell me what place is it in
it did we talk about this or did you just put this down on your notebook did you talk about it with hannah tee and magnolia so erase it
it can we talk about it
100 so this is why you guys need to have a discussion about it this is to help each other out okay wendy what about the next one
1000s wendy thinks this is the 1000s place let us have a discussion about this the decimal is here and it okay the decimal is right here yeah and the number is here so .
what place is this before decimal what place is this ones so this would be the it is right before the decimal right so what would this be be ones did you tell me which one reaches in
do i do not see it there i do not know how to do it where is the decimal am i pointing to it what place comes before the decimal one so what would this be
no so that means you are not following my directions okay so we need to work how
now so let us work together okay 2 more minutes to finish this up and then we are going to go over each one what do you think exxon do you agree with all your choices the 4 or the 6
is what do you think tee so how is it possible that if i ask you to work together you all have different answers how is that possible tell hannah why you think it is the ones place tell her
ds all right let us go over this one who can come up here and label what place the 6 is in
if you disagree thumbs down you think they agree with you thumbs up all right next one pass it to somebody else thumbs up if we agree with tan
else they do not have to have their hands raised it is more fun when they do not
embry are you trying to say the same place as exxon or a different place
place same place so you see how he spelled his all right thumbs up if we agree with glendy thumbs down if we disagree
place do not forget this side of the room the ones place thumbs up if you agree with tao
thumbs down if you disagree hang on let us see who agrees and who disagrees okay good come on tiffany look at that they are clapping for you and everything
alrighty thumbs up if we agree with tiffany that it is in the 100s place thumbs down if you disagree
one hannah can you say it a little bit louder 4 and 600s 4 and 600s sounds good to me
magnolia 6064 and 1818 tenths magnolia says 64 and 18 tenths
is 1818 what hundredths all right let us try that again 64 and 18 hundredths beautiful 64 and 18 hundredths and the next one glendy
4 and 6 hundredths what number is this 6 what number is this 1616 what 100s let us try that again 4 and 16 hundredths 4 and 16 hundredths the next one tee
5 and 83 hundredths 5 and 83 hundredths and last but not least exxon 5 and 13 hundredths 5 and 13 hundredths i love it i love it alrighty so today we are going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another you are going to be using charts
i am going to give 2 to each group these charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another
what does it mean to compare what do you think i mean when i mean to compare decimals think about your goals for today your objective for today what do i want you to do with decimals i will wait because the witnesses seem a little distracted so i will ask my question again compare when you compare numbers what do you do
magnolia compare not quite exxon 10th she just said the same thing and i said not quite numbers magnolia can you read the goal again for a language objective
so i told everyone to start with decimals r s m greater than and equal to so i will ask you again what do you think i mean when i say compare decimals doing only tao knows
only exxon fang what do you think i am going to be asking you to do listening students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than and equal to one another
doing i can not hear you compare the decimals what does it mean to compare question tee to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller or equal to another decimal right
decimals you are going to be seeing whether they are smaller bigger or equal to each other and i want you to use those charts to help you figure it out as a group alright does everyone have those charts okay so we are going to play a group war
and how this works is i am going to give you some time to think about it to think about the numbers by yourself and then you are going to share with your group what you are thinking leader this leader is going to share their thinking with the class
trick each group needs to be prepared to share because you never know which group is going to get called on alright and 2 groups will be getting called on which means you have to tell me whether you agree or disagree with each other okay so let me show you the practice this is a practice round
so i already pre selected these decimals so the decimals that you are comparing is 110th and 12 hundredths you want to tell me if 110th is less than greater than or equal to 12 hundredths you are going to think about it by yourself for 30 seconds 1st and then when i tell you to share your thoughts with your group that is when you are going to share with your group okay
and then i am going to have group one and group 2 193 jabdiel is group is usually here 3 so group one would be inspectors
be we do not have a 17 15 tiffany is group alright so then inspectors will be talking 1st about what they think
and then tiffany is group will be talking about if they agree or disagree with what fang said go group one goes 1st and then group 2 will follow
toes so at this point i want you to pick your leader for your group
me witnesses who is your leader exxon and detectives who is your leader ready so remember i am going to give you 30 seconds to think about it by yourself and then you are going to share your thinking with your leader
so your leader is going to take all the knowledge that you have given him plus or her plus their own and have a discussion about it ready okay so here is the 1st 2 cards
maybe you want to color in 67 hundredths and color in 5 tenths to see which one is greater okay now i want you to discuss it as a group i will give you about one to 2 minutes to discuss it
you need to tell me why is it bigger why is it smaller why is it equal to the other number
use one at time so do not use that one yet did you guys use a chart to help figure it out
30 seconds okay what do you think and then color and model tenths not 10s tenths do not spit at her
okay let us see which group is group one
let us see who is group 2
okay let us see who is up 1st group 2 thinking come on
we agree because we also think 6700 is bigger 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths natan said something interesting true is that true do you remember exxon is cake on friday that we cut it
remember i gave the example of exxon is cake we cut it into hundredths pieces were the pieces bigger no said i know what you meant but hundredths is not bigger than tenths it depends on the situation okay
you know what i mean okay and what do you guys think do you agree with these 2 groups that 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths tiffany you did a graphic representation it so on the charts they actually colored in the 5 tenths and the 6700 bigger exxon hundredths can you say the number
6700 so the 6700 is closer to a whole correct round okay so this is 30 seconds of wait time
i put it right there it is like what question was it
say it again and then repeat after him i think the 1st time was too much for me
it no i did not did you color in 5 tenths correctly is that a new one or is that the old 14 tenths and .
4th 800s okay i thought you colored in the old one
won let us do a different one
we do not have that okay are we ready
why do you respectfully disagree because if you they are the same because if you just put the 0 they will be the same and if you and if you like here it will be the same too same tan he is talking to fang do you mind being quiet can you repeat that again because she kept talking because when you are going to do they are the same because they show the same representation
if you are going to color it you have to color both of those 4 sides so they are the same okay tiffany what do you think you agree or disagree who do you agree with i agree with group 2 you agree with group 2 now tiffany also colored in i like that tiffany keeps using graphic representations because it helps prove your point a little bit better
she colored in 4 tenths right she also colored in 40 hundredths where do they stop place yes so 4 tenths is still 6 tenths away from a whole and 40 hundredths is 60 hundredths away from a whole
2 alrighty and one more round ready i told you exxon is going to aruge it is a hard one it is a hard one because we have not talked about thousandths yet
okay now discuss with your groups what you are thinking is this a little tricky part 2
because if you add another 0 to the 222 hundredths and there is like a 5 over there and 5 is bigger than the 0
so i think it is like part 2 is bigger than part 2 wow what do you think i think it is closer to part 2 why
keep playing okay let us see which group is up 1st
1st what do you think can you speak louder tiffany we think it is part 2 because we think part 2 is what
2 what answer 00 i mean 220 is is bigger than 2200
why think about what tao said because if you add a 0 to 200 still the 5 will be bigger than 0 200 200000s and this would be 225000 which one of those is bigger
225000 225000 is bigger than 220000 right so you are correct part 2 is bigger and i like the way that you guys thought about it also so you are just bringing me on to what i was going to explain to you so let us go back to these 2 decimals that we talked about earlier
sometimes you do not even need a graphic representation to help you figure out how to compare decimals the 1st thing you do is you line up your decimals so that they are one on top of the other compare then we look at our ones place
what are the numbers in our ones place glendy and place and
and what is the number in my tenths place no what about in the 100s place magnolia 11 and compare yes or no
bigger 7 or 5 ritchie 7 the 7 is bigger than 5 so 27 hundredths is bigger than 25 hundredths okay
board 37 hundredths and 4 tenths i want you to tell me if it is less than greater than or equal to in your notebooks by yourself
0.37 how do we say that number 37 hundredths hundredths good it is greater than 4 tenths and 4 hundredths and 4 hundredths it is greater than 0.37
you said 0.37 is greater than 4 tenths is that what you mean to say so you think this number is bigger than this number exxon i respectfully disagree because if you put the 7 to the 4 that will be bigger
mind i said that 4 hundredths is bigger than 0.37 you know what you said at 1st that 0.37 is bigger than 4 tenths day so you are correct
37 hundredths is smaller than 4 tenths you know what i saw when i came around bigger and she said 4 tenths is bigger because 4 is bigger than 3
so this is number 312 recording today is february 8th is that right and it is 11 30 this is math time
okay let us see so i think you still remember this and we are just going to quickly go over what we have covered last time or yesterday okay does anyone remember what jackie said about these numbers comparing these 2 neighborhoods
cole the white cells you add up the yes and the no for a total and that would be equal to 100
100 okay so what makes this easier for us to compare percent kevin because what about the denominator they share the same denominator they share the same denominator right okay so this is 100s this is also okay in 100s and which one is larger now
do you remember per percento percent right so what percent is this 31% this is 31% okay and dylan 34% this is 34% of the people who said yes right compare yes this is very easy to compare right
yes so this neighborhood had more people who said yes okay but if you just look at the numbers 31 17 it is very easy to say 0 yeah of course this is more 31 17 okay but in fact you have to look at the whole thing right
okay so remember this and this is one strategy when you compare percents or change fractions into percents this is one way okay maybe i will have you write down some methods or strategies in your notebook okay
strategy okay can someone explain this percent or how do we turn these numbers you know 31 out of the total into a percent selina we divide the denominator by the numerator okay did we divide
okay so we make a fraction that has a denominator of what
okay a fraction with a denominator of okay 100 right so this is for converting for making a percent okay
one so as long as we can get a denominator to be equal to 100 and we have the equivalent fraction then we have the percent okay here here is another fraction what happened there we made an equivalent fraction right we made an equivalent fraction okay
so how should we word this okay like make equivalent fraction right and what about that equivalent fraction
down i do not know if you have heard of this okay this is called scale or scaling scale up scale down it is like you know simplifying finding equivalent fraction okay
so here the example would be okay we scaled 17 over 50 up to 34 over 100 sense okay why do you think we use the word scale
made okay the large ones you scaled them down to smaller versions right happens do you change the shape or the you know the color
when you scale something down it still looks the same as the original but smaller okay so when we scale the fraction up what does that mean it is still the same fraction but you know it kind of it looks larger but it is not really larger when you look at the ratio so if this is maybe i can give you an example
one to 2 we can scale it up to how can we make a percent percent remember per 100 okay we want a numerator denominator of 100 right
okay now we scale this up to 50 over 100 but if you look at the relationship this is a one to 2 this is half of that right that yes they are still the same they are still equal okay okay scale up scale down okay mean let me give you an example okay
so 15 over 18 okay maybe divide it by 6 okay so this is scaling down right
okay and sometimes actually this is not a good example we will look at it in a few minutes sometimes you will have to scale down okay in order to scale up to go to 100 but this actually does not this is not a good example
works no how about how about this
so how can we turn this into 100 or is it possible or is it not possible
yes so scale down and then scale up okay okay sometimes you will have to do that you simplify it and then you will be able to find the 100 okay as the denominator in this case okay it does not work and we will come back to this okay that and that will be actually our strategy number 3 okay so 12 and we will come back to this okay
now yesterday you also did a fraction bar or a percent bar okay so let us take a quick look at number one and what is the total what is the 100% what number for yao ming
7474 no what is the number attempts 371371 right is that right yeah okay and for shaquille 0 neal the total 725725 okay
so can we just kind of look at this and figure out a strategy for estimating or calculating the percentage of free throws okay
so how many did yao ming make 301 301 okay and how many did shaquille make 451451 so by just looking at the numbers can we say 0 of course shaquille 0 neal is a better is better at free throw
yes and this is out of 771 and you said that the gap you mean the difference between these 2 this okay all right do you agree or disagree so when we look at these numbers we can not just say 0 451 is more you know
okay so what are some strategies for estimating strategies we want to find out the the percent right yes how about using a benchmark number how about using landmark or benchmark numbers right okay so how do you what what is a good number to to round to 300 is this close to 300
yes and we say well let us try 300 okay of now remember we have to find numbers that are easy to work with okay close so we have 370 350 400
350 let us try 350 okay now 300 out of 350 okay so what can we divide this into okay lawrence we divide it into sevenths okay does that work sevenths yes so 123456 sevenths okay
and where would the 300 be 6 sevenths well if we divide this into 3 sevenths the 1st one would be 300 okay and this is 350 so it would be somewhere over here right yes okay so let us put a star here
number what numbers can we use 50 okay does 450 work over 7 750 okay now remember we we want to find numbers that are easy to work with 750 okay
750 can we okay 7 720
720 i think that is a very good number to use i said 720 because it is a multiple of a number 720 is a multiple of a number number a multiple of 566 129
right we want to be able to find you know to to scale it down or up 99 is that a multiple of 9 yes 9 yes 5 so does that mean we can do 9s okay i am not very good at 9s but .
0 that does not work 9s by the thirds thirds very good then into thirds again right
okay so where is 7 where is 720 450 if these are 9s you divide 720 by 9 so each one is 505090908080 right
be number 44 right there 40480 right in the middle of the 480 right in the middle of the 100 around here okay all right let us get the rest of these
and 64640 right so where is 450 180 right there somewhere over there okay it is 140 all right okay so it is closer all right it is closer to 100
okay so i i think these are very close estimates and can we tell by just looking at the 2 lines that yao ming is actually closer to 100% than shaquille 0 neal okay strategy you make a fraction bar or a percent bar okay
now what about the let us see strategies you say i am not going to do rounding maybe i will do halves i will do use benchmark fractions work so let us say this is yao this is yao ming is 371 shaquille is 725
benchmarks so here says what would be 50% 50% that is half be about about 118518185180 is that about 185
okay and what about here 36360 about 3622 okay help now we know half way is about 150 185 and then that is about 360
help can that help us figure out you know where each person was no what are we trying to find right where does 301 belong on this line
no well can we at least say that it is on this side or it is on this side right and how about shaquille it is also on the right
half half of that okay 92 and this is about 180 so 184 okay how about over here you want to be exact okay all right how about over here another 4292 to that right
272270 272 and here 5454340 wow okay now can does this help
301 half and a half it would be between 272 and 371 right 451 in between yeah it would be between these 2
between one half and 3 fourths so so does this help us okay yes i was exact right okay so if you use benchmark numbers you should be able to okay
let us say if this does not work then we can break it down into even smaller parts right but this strategy works okay bar okay let us let us take a look at that that last one and i think that is a very good question
disagree okay this person alicia said yao ming made 301 free throws and shaquille 0 neal made 451 so shaquille 0 neal has the better record
hand marlene i disagree because shaquille 0 neal had an elbow but not shaquille so so you disagree that means what does that mean that yao ming has a better record yes
okay does anyone disagree with marlene is statement and that means you agree with alicia is in other words can we say that shaquille actually has the better record no so you all agree with marlene yes okay but what is the difference if you look at these 2 numbers
just the ones in purple not the denominator just the what are these numbers right so he made yao ming made that many shaquille 0 neal made that many is it possible to argue that he is better he has a better record
yes because you it depends because you do not know the denominator okay all right because you do not know the denominator because well we do know do not we know okay yes but it you know we do know the denominator so yes
2 hundered and 76 okay so you are saying that shaquille missed many more shots than yao ming so he is better
okay the lower the denominator then the cole the denominator yeah and the numerator 0 and the numerator the higher the percentage it is
lower so how about fraction like 13rd these are low right does that mean it is a higher percentage what determines i think cole brought up a good point okay
what determines the the higher a higher percentage percentage just by looking at the numerator and the denominator tell yeah rachel a higher numerator because then no the numerator should be very high because it has to be like close to the numerator to the denominator say that one more time for me
it has to be of course the numerator to the denominator okay so can we say that when the numerator is very close to the denominator that the percentage is higher point okay so what i would like you to think about now is the other strategies that you wrote down
3rd okay so this is one strategy right down estimate rounding
okay maybe we can write this down too okay so this is not finding the exact percentage but we can estimate right
what yes by rounding and using benchmark numbers yes
okay all right so this is a strategy for estimating not finding the exact okay so let us think about what see what i wrote up here okay
so i will i will transfer this over okay you all set with this
use fraction or percent bars right
okay let us say there is a fraction but you can not round the 100 you cannot scale up or down you know to get to 100 and and then you cannot estimate because you want the exact answer okay then what do you do example how about one out of 3
can we scale this up or down to make this 100 into 100 how does this work boys and girls no we can have 26s 39s one over 30 but how do we get to a 100
we can not not example now what happens when you need to make a percent you you can not estimate then it is that is a problem okay and this is when the next strategy comes in handy okay
down divide a denominator before yes what do you get when you do that you have a decimal right
okay so when you have the decimal and then what how do you make it into a percent a percent okay and we will we will practice okay
did you write this down okay so when you cannot do any of the other use any of the other strategies you use this one okay and and it always works okay with this one you divide a numerator by the denominator okay example they are all one over 3 okay so it is 3 divided by one so it is 33%
33 well one out of 3 how can that be 3% right that does not make sense because you do 3 divided by one are we dividing 3 by one no okay i know it does not look very it does not look right but we remember this when we did this
dylan yeah one divided one over 3 and what does this symbol mean divide on the keyboard the computer keyboard that means divide right so when you write you can write it like this so this is the same as that same as that right
yes so how do you divide one by 30 and i think we did this okay put a 0 put a 0 so this is one and 0 tenths 3 goes into 10th that how many times
no so this is 110th if we do the standard way then what happens after a while you notice that it repeats right okay so whenever it repeats then you do not have to go on because it will not stop okay
and we put the little line okay above this and that means it repeats okay so 13rd is the same as 0.30.3 with that bar notation okay at the top now that is only a decimal so how do we turn the decimal into a percent
we move the decimal if you do not put you move 2 spaces back which is it is 0.33 that is 33 but since it is only .3 you put 13rd into it
so since it is all over here there is 0.33 and behind the decimal points it also makes a percent so we need to move that okay and that is what we did i think last month instead of writing the decimal especially when it repeats we made we did not use the remainder right
marlene so we turned that into a fraction a fraction do you put the 13rd at the top here right
and 3rd so this decimal is and is it should we do 0.3 and a 3rd no or 3333 okay 33 because we as jackie said you have to move the decimal point how many spaces
right okay so that means over okay so this is the exact decimal right that is not estimating that is not rounding and you turn it into a percent
33 okay and of course you think about it does it make sense 13rd is that about 33% 333333 that is about a 100 right okay all right so let me have you practice
a referee calls a technical foul on each coach so each coach has to choose one player to make the free throw attempt the winning team may be determined by the free throw and the question is you know who does the coach choose right statistics so for angela angela is history okay when you know she made the free throw
so she made 12 out of 15 free throws 20 christina 13 out of 16 so which player should the coach select to make the free throw attempt and explain your reasoning okay so i want you to do this in your notebook i want you to figure out you know each one and maybe what is the strategy
how do we i mean can we just look at these numbers and say 0 this is the best person in free throw do we have to show our work okay you show your work show your thinking but how do you determine you know who okay so you will have to do some math to find percent right or equivalent fraction so you can compare
lawrence can you make them so they have numerators of a 100 okay you can try to make them so that they all have a 100 you know as a numerator denominator or numerator
okay so go ahead and do it in your notebook okay and let me know if you have any questions
okay okay isabella why are you multiplying this by 20
because 150 probably 15 equals 4 and to get one a denominator of 100 you have to multiply by 20
so when you multiply something by 20 does it get 20 times as much up okay i see what you are doing but if you write it like this that means you multiply this by 20 more so what is the what is the right way to write that
you multiply this by 20 and you multiply this by 20 also like a numerator and how is that different 20 versus 20 over 20 because that shows that you are multiplying each one by 20 if you do that you are just multiplying that whole thing 20 times
okay why do you think christina is the best at free throw yeah because they are both the same because the quickest way to do it that i found out was 3 +3 equals 16
that is 2 it is the easy way if you use if 13 goes into 16 even if these 2 have 3 she had more time to go for free throws than 13 so she got 13 out of 16 and it would be a little it would just be a little bit the percentage would just be a little bit more than this because this has a more because she had more time and then she had 13
okay they had different right that is very good thinking but if you look at the the numbers of attempts okay they all did different they they they used different numbers right yes so how can you figure out the exact percent for angela the exact for emily
can you use any of those strategies you could divide the denominator by the denominator okay now before you do that can we use the other strategies sometimes those are easier okay than dividing right remember we are trying to find fractions that have a denominator of of 150 or like a benchmark 25
yes so can you turn that into a 100 15 maybe you can write it down and yeah put it on this page so we can see
does 15 go into 100 evenly no right so that 1st strategy okay that does not work up if you scale it up it would be 24 over 30
100 try to scale it down and see if that works so do 12 over 15 equal
yeah that is okay because 15 goes into 106 times is it exactly 6 times numbers is there another way to remember the strategies that we talked about
like 15 to 10 and then yeah can you try to scale it up scale it down
okay now why is that a 3 because 12 times 4 okay and a 3 times 4 equals 12 20 okay check this 12 over 15
this is dividing by 3 right this is dividing by 3 so when you divide 15 by 3 it is 5 when you divide 12 by 3
0 so 4 does that work so how many percent is that 80% good so that is an example of scaling down okay in order to go back up right
good okay how did you do this one ming the common factor okay
that 15 out of 20 fraction in other words you turn that into a fraction 15 i made this 20 because if it is rounded down it will be 10
200 and now now we can not round okay why not estimating can you write that fraction here 12 over 15 equal and we are trying to find a fraction that has a 100 at the bottom right
good so then so let us try those strategies one by scaling can you scale down scale down that means make these 2 numbers smaller but yet they still equal the same okay good
good okay 12 and what times 12 12 did you get that exactly and what percent is that
80% so this is a case when you have to round that not round but scale them before you can get to 100 right good so so angela that is 80%
20 so these are common factors they both have 5 good so 15 times 5 equals 75 so i turn it into a fraction 20 times 5 equals 100 so i turn this into a fraction okay and then 75 out of 100 that is 75 good are you trying to use the same way to find emily or are you using a different strategy
okay i am using a all right remember i used the i did it see so this one is both and this one is okay what do you mean both me because 15 out of i put equal because if i round it all up to the 20 so i put 15 +5 will equal 20 so i put 12 +5 now why did you round up
round remember when we do you need this i am all set you are set there yeah thank you ms fong so why do you why why do you need to round
here so this is not estimating okay fraction it is not the same 12 over 15 good it is 2 away and can you use any of those strategies scaling up and down turning the denominator into a 100
did that work
did cause 12 over 15 equals 4 fifths 15th equals 8 over a 100 good and then now do you know the percent 8% good now okay so that is the 2nd strategy what is the last one
divide the numerator okay i need you to show your work
shots so she missed 5 shots 3 so .
so you are trying to say that this person missed the least therefore no because angela also missed 3 but christina had more free throws and angela had less so christina would have had a better chance okay now how about someone who missed one free throw do you think that would be like even better than christina
one does that mean i am better than christina no no 0 that does not yeah so what does that mean can we can you determine by these numbers the number that they missed carmen carmen or bobby carmen not right now dylan okay
just wait please does that work do you need to find the 8 out of 10 exact percent right percent 18 out of 10 attempts can you go back and yep
15 can you write 12 over 15
exactly you see that is a fraction out of this not out of the whole okay we are going to take a few more minutes boys and girls but i one thing i need you to do is to make sure that you write the fraction you show your work okay you that you do not estimate okay
we are not estimating so you need the exact fraction percent one all right so how many percent is this
know because i changed it into a fraction which is 3 fourths right so what is re this is 3 fourths how did you make that into a 34th i i scaled it to 66 over i believe 8 all right now 6 that is half of that right that no
estimating yes okay so we can not use anything that is close to but i think you have the you have the right idea lewis so can you scale it differently okay maybe you can just write the fraction here and try to reduce it try to scale it
down yes or simplify simplify it down to 6 okay okay does that work that is half of that and i do not think so 15 is that an even number
that try another number you can do let us see 4 okay okay divided by 3 good so that is worth this right now does that help
percent how accurate are these parts is this exactly the same as that 80% okay good because these are very close and how do you know if you did these lines accurately
you can tell that she is a little bit better than angela right evenly that this is not a little bit more than that okay now since these are so close can you try to use some numbers to figure out
okay boys and girls we have a couple more minutes let me have your attention okay just for a minute up here
okay so for angela okay since we are not estimating okay i need you to find the exact number okay so what is the what is the fraction there how many out of how many kevin all right and you want to find a remember those strategies
100 yes okay so if 15 does 15 go into 100 evenly no okay if not then we will have to use another strategy right
to okay does that work divided by 3 divided by 3 and then can you scale it up 5 can go into 100 right okay and now we have a fraction alphonsus okay
now for the other 2 people you need to do the same thing so emily and christina one okay can we use the same strategy down can we scale up
100 now that means strategy one does not work strategy 2 does not work and we can not estimate that strategy 3 so we have to go to the last one right
thank you thank you very much this is turned on too right yesterday so we are going to add 2 days starting with to our number line
school and today is the 110th day of school
and we are going to spend just about 10 minutes doing calendar we may not get to everything show me the fraction that tells us how many days we have been in school so far that they are both even they are both even so you know they are going to be divisible by 2
while we are doing this do any of our numbers need part
think if we can reduce more 10 how many more circles will i have before the end of this school year
hexagon no
it so a 109 did not get anything 110 had 2 factors anybody i think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms
was i see a lot of equivalent fractions what would you guys get go 11 over 1811 over 18 that was pretty interesting could you show me the fraction of the days we still ha .
already that is pretty what fraction tells us how much to go do reduce it
remember i see a lot of 35 over 90 so what i want you to do is to look both at 35 and at nintey see if it can be .
year that is what i got too 7 eighteenths and 11 eigteenths those were the 2 numbers them using a less than greater than or equal to symbol compare the fraction that is showing the days we have already done the days we have left m kay good deal alright let us take a look at a couple new things i want to show you
the 1st thing i want us to do is we are going to add see a couple different ways that we could write it we can create an equivalent decimal look at what i am doing
10 colored another 10 number what about using a decimal one and 10 hundredths we also have one one which is one and 110th i see some fractions good job
can you show me the percent what would the percent be
here and i have some new pictures
tomorrow but let us take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month 1st we are going to do it for yesterday and for today
yet valentine is day it is a smile and a heart maybe it is part of the pattern it is it is going to be related to the pattern but we have not seen enough yet joey what did you tell your par .
0 boxes can be shaped like a cube what else can boxes be shaped like can what other shape can boxes be made into
today gary your eyes should be up here this is a rectangular prism same how are rectangular prisms and cubes the same way i like how matthew has his hand raised quadrilateral huh quadrilateral well they are not quadrilaterals but they are faces maybe dimensional so how many faces are there
6 think of a dice or a box how many sides are there else what else luke they have the same number of edges they have the same number of edges of corners
else they have the same number of vertices vertices which is another word for what bottom nobody should be writing anything right now pictures girls your eyes should be looking at my 2 pictures vertices is the same thing as points points corners also they have the same number of faces which are going to be your flat surfaces alright do we have enough really to be able to talk about what our pattern is going to be
see what could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month audrey each heart could be an odd number but tell me what you think the picture is going to be solids alright the next thing we are going to do is we are going to play a game that number crunch went away for a little bit we are going to play a probability game
spins and what we are going to do is i have 2 spinners up here and every day we are going to take the spinner chart who has a prediction about what the .
experiment what do you think luke take a couple of predictions yellow will mostly likely get the most tallies okay yellow let me put this back up here so that you can see point if i see you with your whiteboard i will think that you are not with me you so that you can look up here luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most
okay and i am just going to do a few predictions today because i want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of most going to need someone to help me with this okay who has another prediction josh
will i think red will be the be the best since once you spin it and you probably spin it at the red or the blue it will probably go around and minute hey luke why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most cause it has 2 squares yeah let us take a look at this folks i want you to look at .
say the yellow part is 2 fourths yeah we could say that 2 fourths of it is shaded no okay so we could say one half or 2 fourths are shaded yellow 4th so do you see where luke may have gotten that prediction in a spinner game he thinks that more than likely will land quite a bit there
most because you guys just jinxed it
way not necessarily jinxing and stuff like that blue will have the most i am going to take one more i want a lady this time
madison i think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins 0 good prediction said okay i said i was only going to take one more so put your hands down we got to move on blue plus red .
yellow okay let me find someone who has been on task boy alright and do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner do put your hand down please i am going to take it to a hard surface can i see someone does anyone have a pencil closeby
bud alright what you are going to do is you are going to take it to a flat surface spinner put it or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner count you will let me know how many yellows you had how many reds and how many blues okay alright let us see .
you do your 6 maybe those boys can help you count and i think i am going to let laura do this spinner okay alright so watch watch whoever is closest to you g 0 goodness i almost got you
tallies 1234 and then you strike across brandon if you need to go and do the blinds he got yellow yellow sit down sit down
4 yellows one red one blue 4 yellows okay let us look at what he got 4 yellows 1234 blue okay laura is spinner yours 3 yellows okay so you are going to go strike across
232 reds 2 reds look right now we have 56789101112 we have done 12 spins 0 actually i think we were only supposed to do 20 to do 6 a day
monday we got excited alright so we have 567 yellows
okay i was going to say that red and blue for he predictions i was going to say that red and blue have the same amount red and blue will have here there is one more game that i want to teach you but we need to move on to what we are going to do in math today there is going to be another game where we are adding ounces each day
ooh m kay so we will catch up tomorrow if we add an ounce a day about how many ounces will we have tomorrow we will have about 3 we will have 3 ounces tomorrow okay so we will talk a little bit about that please and when you back to your seats you are going to hold on to your whiteboards hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute i am going to see if you can kind of help me out on the number line
 and then we will put them away when we go to our partner game okay
miss eunice can you throw this away for me you whoops thank you mister for letting me borrow that sweetie i am going to slide behind you
thank you alright get to a place where you can see please we are going to spend a couple minutes here together game that i think i might pick the partners we will have to think about that for just a minute do we have everybody here today from both classes right
we have nobody out okay so we have all 25 that means we will have to have one group of 3 jose is out okay so we do have an even group alright lines i am actually going to put a 3rd one up there but we were kind of running out of room
ones alright what we are going to do is we are going to take a look at a decimal number and think about where it would go on 3 different number lines segment but i want you to show me where do you think you would put this number numbers on my number line 1st of all let me erase this real quick okay
me 3 and 73 hundredths 3.733 and 73 hundredths looking at one looking at num line number one where would you put that number 10 what 2 numbers would that come between
3 and 4 and who thinks they can come and show me where it would come come what we are going to work on today is refining the ability to compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line it okay who agrees with that
yours yes question if we were going to round this number 4 and i was telling my my science class that i will not be here on monday because of jury duty but this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is you will be thinking about rounding so i think it is kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today
bit but 3.73 is closer to 4 line which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer is not it alright now what i am going to do is i am going to erase this guy for just a minute and i am going to erase these numbers cause we are going to use this .
line we will call it number line 2 what is different about the 1st one that we just looked at david it was going by ones and this one is going by 5s okay so this one is kind of going by halves that is why my last number is a what
where would this number fall on this number line numbers because now you are not just looking at the whole number well so show me what 2 numbers it would come in between
line where would it fall on this one so now you are having to compare .73 with another number she put it between 3.5 and 4 who agrees with that
ready i am going back up to the 1st one better what is different about this number line
what i forgot to put my last point alright so what are my 2 whole numbers
show me on your whiteboard where you think 3 and 73 hundredths would fall that because 3.7 and then you just need to go up 3 more and then you have it
kn he knew it was going to be bigger than 3.7 so he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this and i knew it was going to be less than 3.8 and he knew it was going to be less than this said he said in this case he had to look at the hundredths place if i wanted to round 3.73 boy we could just play with this number all day could not we
have we are just going to do a couple more things with this number
that means you are going to have .00.00 here so is it going to be closer 44 what is it closest to if it is right here
4 okay can you round it to the closest 10th yes is it closer to 3.7 or 3.8 where would it fall 3.7 it would be the same thing as 3.7 i mean 3.70 well it would not be the same thing but it would round well right it would round to 3.7 okay and could you round it to the closest 100th what would that look like
 that that that would not really make any difference it would still be 3.73.70 alright we are going to play a partner game kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day where we were using the decimal cards and you were .
you are going to have a recording sheet and you are going to have numbers and to use your great than less than and equal to symbols kay
i had to get you one that was more challenging to be able to play
transitioning okay the 1st thing that you are going to do is i want you to take a look at your recording sheet you are going to play 5 rounds david can you slide up sweetie you are going to play 5 rounds of this game
and i want you to be thinking is this game going to be more luck or strategy
yourself where is the extra papers
you 0 my goodness my helpers you did not think to make things more efficient necessarily i make it more okay does everybody have a recording sheet for this game yes moment the 1st thing you are going to do is you are going to roll the dice you and your partner yet okay i roll i got a 3 she got a 3
this you want to play class against miss courson for a couple of rounds yes alright sh 2 so who got less you right i have less so what i am going to do is how many circles are on my recording sheet
all the way down my paper i am going to go less than less than less than yes go ahead and you guys put greater than 5 times 5 times
game and you are going to you are going to be one person and i am going to be the other person me m kay alright so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who is going to go 1st
 the highest number wins or the lowest number wins by the way 1st just simply because i got to teach you the game anyway right so this is what huh did you cheat watch alright let us listen go ahead and write this all the way down your paper as well
thans now it really does not matter who rolls the dice 1st just whoever you star with you need to stick with times alright i got a 2 and watch what i am doing when i roll the dice i am putting it in the order okay so a strategy game would be i would have to maybe decide where to put it
alright now roll the other 26 yes do not say yes yet works is that number sentence true
happen what whose paper is this a true sentence on yours so guess who gets the point you aw point because that made an accurate and true number sentence 2 and 26 hundredths is less .
watch now listen though shh way so i want you to and if you take your paper home and your mom is like did your teacher tell you that was right it would be difficult to explain so i want you somewhere on your paper to write it the correct way
2 do you see what i mean by this is luck
okay you ready garett we are going left to right 4 times challenging 44 okay so we need 0112 yay we got a point is that a correct state .
yes do not forget to correct it on your paper wait it is already correct on our paper 0 that is right i need to correct it
likelihood of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than you want a turn baby or you have a question i guess i want a turn okay you know what though i think i get to go fir .
alright and what i want to show you is for friends who might need who may not if it is really close and you are not sure what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it picture so on your whiteboard listen to what i am sayin
put your hand down for just a moment on your whiteboard i want you to draw a picture of that number sentence use your flats your longs and your units
tenths and your hundredths okay calendar this is the picture that matches no what i was recommending this for was if you got something like this
yes buddy what if they are equal well if they are 0 if they are equal it or a tie breaker or a tie breaker you could do that too
friends we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back okay so you got to make sure you get up the things you need to get up home i am going to put a prompt on the board i am going to have you write in your math notebook and then we are going to share at the very end of class after this game
okay let me stick it under her desk okay have you started working yet no okay let us go come on
and who writes the greater than down their paper and that does not change
alright and laura roll it again you are going to do the whole 1st .4 let us look at that
because hers is actually less than 2 and 44 hundredths so who gets that and i do not care where you guys try to write it somewhere on the paper so that means hers it correct yours is not
okay 0 i like that a tally chart that works okay who is my greater than and .
you all are going to have the same numbers going across it is just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence the other one will not be
so what do you have to do if he got that point that means yours is not right you have to correct it
m kay let us do number 3 then i am going let me help you
okay did you write down the 1st 6
and one of these is correct the other one is not
yeah so what you are going to do .
who is your partner fatima fatima is
okay alright boys and girls as you come to a stopping point hey you all boys and girls eyes on me please boys friends on the floor aria
board 3.7 or 3.653 point explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words write we are going to share these in about 8 minutes so a quick write means you are sitting down you are getting it done
home hurry put my clipboards away please put my dice away
i am also going to pass out your homework for tonight it is a review of what we have done
which number is larger 3.7 or 3.65 explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words and also symbols and i will write your homework on the board p pass this down to brandon and audrey please the game sheet that you guys had today you could take that home with you
now and i think someone might be missing their math notebook because it has been up here on the table i think that is that is colby is i think it is
larger 3 and 7 tenths or 3 and 65 hundredths explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words minutes keep writing pw i put ps nintey 6 because you see they have named it differently
book yeah that is why it says ps 96 not pw
pictures maybe similar to what we did back before the game part madison the way i know 3.7 is greater than 3.65 is because if you added 0 to 770 is greater than 65 yes that is correct
one audrey 3.7 is farther on the number line so it is larger it is farther on the number line if we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class it would be down a tad would not it
lumber in the number line and it is also no the 7 is maybe 700 yeah look at said he compared the tenths place and he knew that 7 was greater than what 6 yeah brandon what would you get
3 and 7 tenths is larger than 3 and 65 hundredths i know this because 10 times 10 is 100 so 7 times 10 is 70 and 70 is greater than 65 okay josh i think 3 3.7 is bigger becau .
pictures using x is or a 100s chart or dots
okay i did take one minute and share to the person to the right or to the left or across from you but turn to your elbow partner let them see your math thinking make sure you have your homework packed up tomorrow listen guys for just a 2nd daily grade on this skill tomorrow cause i think we are good with it
arrows yeah very nice friends we are also going to try to work on our bridges tomorrow kay again it is time for us to start testing the trucks to see if they can fit across how is it a truck i i do not see anything this has to be able to go across your bed and this has to be able to go under your bridge kay
i am shooting for our ceremony being on february 16th that is that thursday the bridge breaking ceremony
numbers all right now kirby could you give me a big big large number 1012 now where do you get that is it 1000 a large number or extra large extra large 1000 yeah because our our focus was in how many how much is a 1000 so that is a large number
how much is a 1000 how many 10 do we have in a 1000 how many 100 do we have in a 1010 we have 2000 good job 1000 in a 1000 and we did our we did our what did we do to the chart of or book of 1000 all right okay pretty soon pretty pretty soon when we finish that set
the section 2 pretty soon today we are going to kind of have people helping people because some people i walked around the other day and see some people have difficulties completing the last section of unit 2 2 the section 2 is really asking you to either add and these vocabularies kirby these vocabularies
question look at the vocabularies and tell me what question do they ask you when you are adding
how much is it all together or how many by now there is another question when they ask you to either add or take away or subtract see all these vocabulary words subtract now one question ingrid they always ask one question when you need to take away take away
subtract subtract they ask you that question and we said we learned that you could do it both ways ingrid look at the vocabulary words and tell me which which word do you see more often very often to subtract now yeah when we subtract how many more
money so that probably i said 0 maybe i need to add that we learn how to do with both ways we could add or we could what that means when we landmark in that number and our landmark could be walk forward and or walk if you step back doing and some people show me that in that book when i check it some people say 0 i know what to do
whatever how much more do we need to get to a 1000 now the things that i would like to introduce today but we are not going to focus on it too much now if we if we if you just turn around for a minute just turn around face back with the place value chart that we have just turn around you do not need to get up just turn around thank you
all right now we have one 10 100 100 all right very good i have everyone looking at me then we have 1000 what do we have before that the comma 1000 we bet on so this is 1000 place and it is
2 no in the 1000 place we have 2 but 10000 100000 10000 100000 let us stop there let us stop there in the 1000 place let us see people who are really paying attention like reggie is doing good good kirby nick good job
all right now we we just stop in the 1000 but not just 1000 please but that is but not just 1000 please now i want to ask you a question in the 10000 place how many how many 10 do you think is in 10000
200 wait a minute 10000 place how many how many yes 2010 or no in the 10000 please 0 how many 100s are in in the 10000 or how many 10 is in in now let me break it simple
10000020000 that is the simple things now next next like tomorrow and next week we are going to work in the 10000 hey 10000 place 10000 chart 10000
how many now see what you are saying rebecca rebecca now you are answering her that is not good sorry thank you now listen how many 100s is in that 10000 110 100 or one 100
10100 100 that is all 100 time 100
same right now listen we learn today
okay okay all right well how much is it when are we going to learn about 1000000 that is a question i will answer later right now listen reggie reggie reggie and nick
now the page is that we still going to work how many 100 is in the 10000 was in here 0 yeah look at that on the board i put it how many 100 and we just learned that how many 10 is in 10000 10000 10000 so another thing
exactly see now i could tell some people have good strategy it is like 5 and 200 added to number 0 we add 2 more . equal to you now listen carefully i want to see people who are ready
book now i need i need to see people who can who are doing ingrid you do not have your math book on your desk desk math book math book
but the problem that is remaining a problem for everyone is the money problem how much more money and the decimal part of the money is the one that is giving some people a hard time when they ask you when they ask them what is your change what is the change that you should have is the one
so on page listen on page 23 check for me check for me is it page 23 that asks you for a money problem is it 23 or 21 check 2323 is a money problem 231 and 23
19 kirby is it 23 21
let us see if nick are you willing 0 all right 21 will be more let me see can i see can i see yours thank you 22 we are not in 22 we are looking into 23 which was a money problem
i do not know page 23
it rebecca 23 rebecca rebecca it is unit 5 landmark in large number and we are going to 23 very good
job right is it unit 5 23 good job now that page reggie could you read for me
now let me let me ask ismael to read the problem now now i want everybody everybody is following see he is not paying attention and he is not on that page job if you are on page 23 and for these people that are have already done it
us tara saved 11 . saved 143 from her baby sister 123 $123 good job
line all right tara saved $143 from babysitting and open . a bank account a bank account
$829 more i like to hear the word more remember we are focusing more something how much money does she have in the bank the bank of the year 0 this is an easy problem
it all right turn around turn around turn around let us see let us walk around and see those people that kind of did the good job and we will share the answer we will share the answer 0 please we will share the answer and i will give you a few minutes because you i know you are so good at adding
minute one minute let us give ismael one minute now i will give you a minute to solve it and do whatever they ask you to do do now you know what can i have this good job
check and see if you add right good job maybe i do not know right check and see check with your neighbor and see if you add right just check that is okay i will check with you
now could you ask that question again that last question they ask you how much money does she have in the bank in the bank did they at the end of the year now is it an altogether problem more that is what i was writing so it is either how much more or how much all together or how much in total
excellent how much how much yeah all right now you cannot move forward now you do not do that all right do not do it all right now next question next question let us move to problem 2 problem 2 number 2 number 2 daphka can you read that problem for us
okay almost a dollar good job you must expense to make a dollar that is what i always want . you make a one job now excuse me nick nick so she is done reading now your turn to continue
job all right keep going yep all right how much money did she spend spend how much money did she spend no we do not need the answer some people i am going to touch yeah no no
money everyone should have done how much money because i i hear a decimal how much money is the decimals in there yes yes it is almost a dollar but it is not yet 2.50 right 2.49 almost 2.50 is not there
my goodness see she is she is not really paying attention she is not paying attention to hers your answer probably is right but if you do not pay attention to the decimal dollar sign are you really paying attention to it you are not looking at yours okay that is the thing
you know what in your after you add you need to pay attention to that you what did you do with the decimal you add do you add the decimal while you adding did you add the decimal add the decimal see that is the thing you are not paying attention to me you do not add the decimal where are the decimals good job good job
you know you are not really you did not add it and if you add it in your result there would be where is the decimal did you additional did you add it yes where is it in the answer now where is the answer where is your answer look at your answer look at your answer that is the problem i feel people have
see you you see you add those decimal where did you put them 0 wow see she does not he does not add it
what was the 1st price the 1st price what was it
okay 799 hold on 799 and i put my dollar sign thank you $99 yeah it is 9 okay now what is my next one
$2.492 49 and that is my decimal and 49 almost ¢50 sign and you have to put that dollar sign thank you
so people start adding and you always start adding on the . one place ones place is always . 1st the left and the right side right hand side
way excuse me nick nick nick this is the ones place and we add on the right hand side hand see he is playing with the pencils he no him
one and then do i carry the one or what do i do
see he is not paying attention that person i am doing it for he is not paying attention when i say add the decimal and this is i add the decimal add the decimal no on one minute for your question add the decimal then what do i do continue carry the one carry the one yeah 88 +2 equals 10
yes yes that is 2 people rebecca is not paying attention she is talking to someone else i am showing you how to add the decimal down here
forget do never never forget to add your dollar sign and your decimal and it is so easy but some people it is easy that is why some people forget
yep you give us good feedback yeah now listen listen ismael listen need they asked me a question what else do i need to do about that question nick can you help me
sentence now check to see if you write a sentence for each of them let me see people who did write this and i know good job sentence some people did not and i know who but i am not saying anything and i am waiting for them to write that sentence down
but some people told me i am done i am done but i see i could tell and i see and that is why we go back for some people who already completed a lot of the work sentence i am correcting 0 you are correcting good job how about you kirby did you write a sentence
yes yeah what is your sentences he spend $10 to $28
all right now let us see he spent let me see what he spent . see you still did not did not i . i am glad i checked you did not add the decimal 0 it looked like . i did it because of you
yeah good job ah did you write your sentence let us see this sentence job sentence sentence see good job
do let me see job now why do the last question asks you what easy yeah yeah can i see if you do a good job
no see now kirby is adding dollar sign where he does not you need to pay attention problem money problem that kind of give people a hard time
money where and we will see number 4 about the decimal 3 things now let us put down 3 things we learn about money problem do rebecca rebecca rebecca i need your help 0 okay 3 things 3 things so money let us put down money problem
1st of all with that dollar sign good job careful and i will just put money problem be careful be careful we are not remember
let us put it in a sentence if you want to put it . remember in your learner is notebook today i rebecca control it
remember when we are doing money problem and then we are going to go over decimal sign decimal sign do not forget decimal sign decimal decimal is decimal a sign no it is end it is end decimal is called end end so could i put decimal and or decimal is also and when you are reading it
so reading number 2 all right now let me wait for let me wait for juliana yes juliana number 2 so we need to remember decimal to add decimal add decimal and it is end the dollar sign do not do not forget to add
and do not forget when you are doing dollar sign dollar sign see i just put it dollar sign
she asked me a question and it is maya that remind us decimal could be read as end end and this is something sometimes we skip it or we forget $5 and $5 and and $25 and you mean a and d and yeah or d and no not the end but and
plus the cents for example 2.49 $2.49 and we could read could be read as $2 and 40 and see the and $48 and 45 and ¢49
job all right now something we need reggie 3rd things we learn do not forget to add the dollar sign decimal and the cents and the cents and the same sign yeah but once you put the dollar sign mean you know where to add it
numbers so sometimes i put this sign for numbers reggie again yeah huh sometimes i put that sign for numbers all right look at that you are supposed to know how subtracting or adding now that is one thing that is in the problem but we are talking about after we add or subtract then things we need to remember
remember 11 me as we are adding or after we are adding
¢55 yep but you add a 0 next to 5 thank you that is another thing but 3 important things you say when you finish did i when i say revise your math rebecca when i say revise your math these are the things i say especially if it is money yeah if it is money
2626 we are on 26
so things you learned today 123 ah now let us see if daphka is with us on page 26 26 yeah okay now can you read for us
nick close one of the starting problem above use it to solve this problem okay
work if you are talking you are not raising your hand you can not talk to your neighbor and we need your participation away no no no notes away notes away notes away no no i do not want that no away yeah okay nick is the one that is reading and he is going to help us
on the top this is 9 94 $5 so they said this one they call it a starter problem mean do not want you to go through stuff thank you it is a beginning or it is a start problem and that problem could help you solve the next one
how many people understand that the starter mean yes they give me a problem to start with or they give me something that i could look up to now what is the starter problem juliana 0 i got you wrong juliana what is the starter the starter problem tell me the starter problem is a problem no no you do not need to repeat just tell me what is it on page 26 that we are going to start with
problem it is a money problem $9949 $5 $9 and i put the dollar sign do not forget $994909949 and 94 yes $9.94 cents thank you
9 and 94 $5 one person please 11 rebecca rebecca you are not really helping us if you are not really wait for your turn to talk rebecca yes
see people who are paying attention watch my mistake
did not they say $9 $5 so it is $14 now how does this starter problem will help now let me wait for rebecca rebecca is really up yeah they give me 2 more starting problems rebecca rebecca yes now what is the next problem they give me
the next problem is to choose one of the 3 problems above and use it to solve this problem that they give you i know but what is the next $9 wait a minute we did this one no that is it
okay $9.94 $5.16 that is not the next one that is not the next one that is the next one fine $9 $5 we did that
help $9 $9 $4 so we take away the 94
away yeah we take away the 94 and one so we take away 194 and that gives us what only $5 left is it take away it is addition take away it is addition thank you
but that is $5 this is a 5 yes
let us see if they really choose it is a dollar sign okay i just now i am glad
see ismael is working . did you do this one plus okay ooh
it you have not done this one you know you could all right shirley could you give her a hand sure let us see see can i see
no i know 15 okay we will find some more things to 0 good job that is not true she was covering too i am already done okay i did not do that one
okay that is you do not have to you do not need to do this one i can help you all right now listen 2526 that is what we did i want you to check 27 check 27 and 2827282728272827282728 good job
let us see 27 it is the 1st number on this is very and you have to time it by 101027 good job
now i want you to see you did not finish this could you help him with this good job for a minute okay help him you may turn over now wait here you may turn over give him a hand right here and right there
when i come back i am going to check and see thank you reggie a ¢100 is a dollar right yeah so if you can not but why do not you put why do not you put the dollar you did not put the dollar sign sign the dollar sign 0 that is 11 no dollar sign good job
and where is the decimal that we talked about decimal where is the decimal it is a dollar one one so it is one it is right behind the one thank you good job now if you add a dollar to $14 you get $15 and there is ¢10 left i got a pen no this one she did this one did she do a good job there she did not do the 1st one
okay so do the 1st one let us see people who are really see i am taking this i am really taking it i need to ask
it i just did not do it because i was working my 1000 but do not worry no you are not doing this we need you 0 you did this 0 you also did this okay good
god rebecca could you check with daphka and see if she really gets it sure thank you it just check daphka daphka rebecca is going to give you a little bit of help
do you really need i really do not huh thank you
one minute good job
doing she is good okay good how is ismael doing job decimal decimal is there a decimal there now
job victoria good job you and then we will all right good helpers friend helping friends reggie sit down
okay shirley thank you rebecca thank you let us check together all right let us see
now could you tell us what he did not get help what help did you give him him rebecca rebecca rebecca i need you to listen to him yeah all right hold on
hold on we are really some people are not listening let us wait for rebecca again
job now we are sharing what kind of help did that person need so that person gets it and moves on know but some people miss a few victoria i need your help when it is time to do our final sharing coming together see what we learned
again i helped with this and showed the numbers that he can not add 0 he could not add a few numbers it he can not add he could not but now he could listen it all right how about somebody else
he did not know how to use to break it apart break it apart just to use another problem to help solve the other problem good job right because that one asked you to use the starter problem to help
again because when one is talking we need to have everyone listening so she kind of helped her with use that starter problem they already did for you to start you started and then use it to solve the next problem which is similar but they make it a little bit different
shirley she had money and she did not know how to break the numbers ingrid did you learn something yes okay what did you learn now add the money
yes but i do not know the way you were talking i thought you knew when i looked at the 1st problem we did about money you told us so much that was helpful so how do you feel now
maggie yes we are talking here we need you she got the things but she just needed somebody to check them good job so you checked the dollar yeah yeah did you the dollar and of the decimal she is kind of like keep on forgetting about them but all the answers are right very good how do you feel daphka you get .
okay so the thing that we learned today what one now we need kirby to tell us one number one you number one do you need your paper for that no you we need you to sit down i learned about large number huh i know
but we did not stay and say . hm hm number i do not know what is the number i wanted to are you reading are you reading for him number what did you learn about large number what did we do we did we broke it apart all right hold on willing we broke it apart i have a problem we got to the 1000
no large number what did we do 1st things what did we review what did we review about large number 1000 thank you thank you yeah how many 1000s in 10000 10000 how many 10s on 10000
thank you that is just she is still talking times and i hear your voice and when we are doing our final sharing i want everybody to go home and tell their parents you thank you what we learned now what else so large number that is what we reviewed and you were telling me .
me yeah 1000 is a large number
let us wait if juliana wants to tell me i am waiting and everybody is getting there what else paper okay you can not all right go ahead
more how many like how may more how many more are similar money it could be cookies it could be anything when they ask you how many more and we could add or we could take away to figure it out
all right but it is your own strategy that counts one things exactly 0 i know how to do it people tell me a lot of times 0 i will do it this way i will do it that way how about ingrid that person the other thing that we have learnt huh is when you do your money problem hold on hold on
back what do you need to put in a money problem like a decimal point decimal point in the money problem
sign decimal decimal line up numbers line up numbers line up numbers correctly correctly so you could when you add in the decimal that is a vocabulary also all right that is a vocabulary wait
word there are many vocabulary words we do not even put up there yeah so which one do you say we should have put up there no no
what else do we know about fractions the top number is the .
okay we are going to talk about what the top number is called and what the bottom number is called go ahead isaac what do you know about fractions .
who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape
whole okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute is valid or what what we are saying is true have there is a certain way to write the okay alright lots of information
thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction is a fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay
whole we could call it a region
okay it is part of that whole or region a fraction is also a part of a group of things or we could call it a set of things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group
that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it fractions you are going to take an equal part set okay so i want equal parts here my whole
how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want i want to cut something in half one line in the middle right in the middle okay i want an equal amount on one side side so i just did what to that hole
in half half so i am going to label that half a half okay and how i label it number of pieces i cut this into how many pieces 22 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the .
denominator denominator okay or the bottom number some of you told me right that is the denominator the number of pieces i shaded in .
ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see half one half and one half right one half here one half here 2 okay this is my group
set how many are there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 6 and i say these are jellybeans and i am hungry this afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans
kay that is my fraction what is the numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry alright so my nu 6 i colored in 3 out of 6 i am going to eat 3 out of 6 i am going to get fat
okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in number is the one that you shaded in pieces or the number in the set or the group
top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about and the denominator is the .
6 alright so that is just some of your vocabulary numerator and denominator if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards match your vocabulary word with what it means with its meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish
it is kind of like go fish i would like you to play concentration with them 1st down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match
yep numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction
here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
not so 3 sixths is the same as one half one half they are the same thing okay they are equivalent fractions i could do this with my region region whoops sorry here it is okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i
so now it is not halves i am talking about it is what sixths and how many did i color in
4 is half of 83 is half of 6 is ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then we have got one half 3 sixths somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is .
10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another one
51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job okay you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions that is the question i was going to ask what that if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent w .
no it is an equivalent fraction to one half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are area or they name the same part of a set
a a region or a whole that is not a fraction this is not a fraction this is that region of that whole piece that is not a fraction is it a equal lateral whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of .
but it has to be equal part you have to remember that okay equal part a mixed number is .
a fract a whole number and a fraction okay a whole number and fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number .
 and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number it is a whole number plus a fraction give me a mixed number one half good 5 and one half number and a fraction dante .
6 6 thirds i mean 3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good
caitlin 8 and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way number okay an improper fractions has a larger numerator over a smaller denominator 0
2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what what how many halves is it
2 let us count them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half
0 and there are 12345 halves these are the same yes okay i think the only other vocabulary words you need to know benchmark fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the .
definition okay because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year and then the last .
simiplest form that is another one i am going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions is there a problem right here
vocabulary cards look vocabulary cards okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here
you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice addition and subtraction there is extra paper right in the back okay this center right here can i just borrow that just the top part honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st
already turn the question around into your answers okay so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer okay jaylon you hold this one it goes right here
okay alright do not forget you are working .
ayana christian so put your name and date and i will be right with you okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper okay
somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that what is a fraction what is a fraction it is a .
whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay
did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart okay let us say that our hershey is bar .
it okay can you imagine that in your head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here close your eyes and think about it
3 and how do you know that cause this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but .
okay i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar 66 so the whole candy bar has how many pieces 6 so what do we call that number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in
now if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces 33 so what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3 yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word numerator say it
numerator one more time numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the of 6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
denominator you guys are getting these words really mixed up
do not star say it again the numerator michael you say it
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it
6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you
denominator good denominator denominator perfect so how many pieces are there in the candy bar
eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another 3 sixths equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes
for by 6 okay 4 times 6 or 4 by 6
no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy are in this candy bar 644 by 6
thank you michael thanks okay see when you are paying attention you are right on sit up straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6
right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie and only makenzie okay alright if i were to find w .
let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here
because 12 +12 equals 2424 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in
listen to the conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil take a pencil line right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares no we did not okay
am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount we are each going to get 12 small pieces okay now okay almost alright now i cut my candy bar in half and i gave half to makenzie so we are both going to get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay
now this is what i want you to do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units 24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way .
to give me 2 equal pieces i want .
way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar
see i want to see another way to make one half on your paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one i label this half and this half and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar
okay did you find a new way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing because if they are not something needs to be done about it
isaac what is wrong nothing okay okay let us see if we found a different way
there you need to write the the how many squares are in that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in
bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did good job you just labeled it wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
job makenzie let us see yours same way yeah i did mine diagonally did you label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job 0 d let us think about that would diagonal count let us let us think about it
that is a good question who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half what do you think do you have the same number on top and on bottom no yes absolutely good look at me nice job
in one half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half do you still have halves know i mean yes yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2 and there is 8 and there is and there is watch 2 how much do we have to split it in
sec ayana hold on a sec means stop okay okay take a look at what i did
absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles so what do you think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge i challenge you to make one more different way one more different half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other i challenge you
half i do not see that you separated this rectangle anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
did you guys go through the cards once yeah did you win no did savannah win yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time won 0 congratulations yeah i got like 4 okay i kept on guessing but i got it .
set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed it said something it said something that is on the top
i do not think it said that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator what is a benchmark well where are your what are your matches show me your matches we just put them down 0 you just put them down did everybody check each other is work yes okay you show me .
wash your hands with soap and water i will be right over
5 minutes what honey there are 4 centers i did not say you were going to do them all today 0 miss richards i found 2 ways ooh show me yay i did this show me see christian show us yours okay so 1st you know what i am just going to go over it with green so we can see it okay kay
did you check to make sure there is 12 in each yeah awesome and which which other ones 123456789101112 nice job christian woah did you say you did 2 more 0 well hold on to that one
everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana so right here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper you have made a half christian 2 halves make a .
whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals one see 123456789101112 nice job ayana
show everybody guys take a look at ayana is 12 good work did you do another one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you
you have made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay as many pieces as you cut your whole into christian no it is not because you have made .
look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece 0 it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
11234567891011 twelfths nice job say 12 square units one half you have made half this is way easy
you have got to take everything out except for the one line that you are using to cut your 4 by 6 rectangle in half go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit come over here okay i did one
i do not under i do not see the halves did you do this boom boom boom boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see no cause if you do .
alright you guys listen how many people i need you to sit down ayana but you know what cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table have a seat have a seat that is okay that is alright it is okay we are learning and sharing okay what do we do
that is only 6 square units not 12 this you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next nicholas are you all set
up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now i am going to challenge you and i am going to walk away your challenge put your hand down to fill the rest of these nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay listen listen listen 1st i will come over and look at yours in a sec
but do not we need different numbers listen if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2
cause the denominator is going to be 4 you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch watch you made halves like this right yes i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them 4 no
6 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into 6 and the number of square units is 6 that is right do we have a number yep we do alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me
hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them okay if you need more paper it is here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
see that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i .
new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 1234567891011120 right here okay i see that now
lovely i did it but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction adam are you all set no thank goodness scoot in
do you have to write how you figured it out or can you do it on this paper because it says to .
guy that is fourths good job yep okay i told this group to bring do you have all your matches together and you have all your matches together let us see if they isaac go have a seat
a number that has a whole number and a fraction a whole number and a fraction is that called a me is that called simplest form what is that called mixed number oops let us fix that one
so this is number 312 recording today is february 8th is that right and it is 11 30 this is math time
see so i think you still remember this and we are just going to quickly go over what we have covered last time or yesterday okay does anyone remember what jackie said about these numbers comparing these 2 neighborhoods
cole the white cells you add up the yes and the no for a total and that would be equal to 100 so it would be 3.01 over 100
100 okay so what makes this easier for us to compare percent okay kevin because what about the denominator denominator they share the same denominator right okay so this is 100s this is also okay in 100s and which one is larger now
do you remember per percento percent right so what percent is this 31% this is 31% okay and dylan 34% this is 34% of the people who said yes right compare yes this is very easy to compare right
yes so this neighborhood had more people who said yes okay but if you just look at the numbers 31 17 it is very easy to say 0 yeah of course this is more 31 17 okay but in fact you have to look at the whole thing right
okay so remember this and this is one strategy when you compare percents or change fractions into percents this is one way okay maybe i will have you write down some methods or strategies in your notebook okay
strategy okay can someone explain this percent or how do we turn these numbers you know 31 out of the total into a percent selina we divide the denominator by the numerator okay did we divide
okay so we make a fraction that has a denominator of what
okay a fraction with a denominator of okay 100 right so this is for converting for making a percent okay
one so as long as we can get a denominator to be equal to 100 and we have the equivalent fraction then we have the percent okay here here is another fraction what happened there we made an equivalent fraction right we made an equivalent fraction okay
so how should we word this okay like make equivalent fraction right fraction it has to have a numerator a denominator of .
down i do not know if you have heard of this okay this is called scale or scaling scale up scale down it is like you know simplifying finding equivalent fraction okay
so here the example would be okay we scaled 17 over 50 up to 34 over 100 sense okay why do you think we use the word scale
made okay the large ones you scaled them down to smaller versions right happens do you change the shape or the you know the color
when you scale something down it still looks the same as the original but smaller okay so when we scale the fraction up what does that mean it is still the same fraction but you know it kind of it looks larger but it is not really larger when you look at the ratio so if this is maybe i can give you an example
one to 2 we can scale it up to how can we make a percent percent remember per 100 okay we want a numerator denominator of 100 right
okay now we scale this up to 50 over 100 but if you look at the relationship this is a one to 2 this is half of that right that yes they are still the same they are still equal okay okay scale up scale down okay mean let me give you an example okay
so 15 over 18 okay maybe divide it by 6 okay so this is scaling down right
okay and sometimes actually this is not a good example we will look at it in a few minutes sometimes you will have to scale down okay in order to scale up to go to 100 but this actually does not this is not a good example
works no how about how about this
so how can we turn this into 100 or is it possible or is it not possible
so scale down and then scale up okay okay sometimes you will have to do that you simplify it and then you will be able to find the 100 okay as the denominator in this case okay it does not work and we will come back to this okay that and that will be actually our strategy number 3 okay so 12 and we will come back to this okay
now yesterday you also did a fraction bar or a percent bar okay so let us take a quick look at number one and what is the total what is the 100% what number for yao ming
7474 no what is the number attempts 371371 right is that right yeah okay and for shaquille 0 neal the total
725725 okay so can we just kind of look at this and figure out a strategy for estimating or calculating the percentage of free throws okay
so how many did yao ming make 301 301 okay and how many did shaquille make 451451 so by just looking at the numbers can we say 0 of course shaquille 0 neal is a better is better at free throw
of 771 and you said that the gap you mean the difference between these 2 this okay all right do you agree or disagree so when we look at these numbers we can not just say 0 451 is more you know okay so what are some strategies for estimating
strategies we want to find out the the percent right yes how about using a benchmark number how about using landmark or benchmark numbers right okay so how do you what what is a good number to to round to 300 is this close to 300 yes and we say well let us try 300 okay
of now remember we have to find numbers that are easy to work with okay close so we have 370 350 400
350 let us try 350 okay now 300 out of 350 okay so what can we divide this into okay lawrence we divide it into sevenths okay does that work
sevenths yes so 123456 sevenths okay and where would the 300 be 6 sevenths well if we divide this into 3 sevenths the 1st one would be
300 okay and this is 350 so it would be somewhere over here right yes okay so let us put a star here number what numbers can we use
450 okay does 450 work over 7 750 okay now remember we we want to find numbers that are easy to work with 750 okay
750 can we okay 7 720
720 i think that is a very good number to use i said 720 because it is a multiple of a number 720 is a multiple of a number 566 129
right we want to be able to find you know to to scale it down or up 99 is that a multiple of 9 yes 9 yes 5 so does that mean we can do 9s okay i am not very good at 9s but .
0 that does not work 9s by the thirds thirds very good then into thirds again right
okay so where is 7 where is 720 450 if these are 9s you divide 720 by 9 so each one is 505090908080 right
be number 44 right there 40480 right in the middle of the 480 right in the middle of the 100 around here okay all right let us get the rest of these so what is the next one
and 64640 right so where is 450 180 right there somewhere over there okay it is 140 all right okay so it is closer all right it is closer to 100
okay so i i think these are very close estimates and can we tell by just looking at the 2 lines that yao ming is actually closer to 100% than shaquille 0 neal okay strategy you make a fraction bar or a percent bar okay
now what about the let us see strategies you say i am not going to do rounding maybe i will do halves i will do use benchmark fractions work so let us say this is yao this is yao ming is 371 shaquille is 725
benchmarks so here says what would be 50% 50% that is half and what number would that be about about 118518185180 is that about 185
okay and what about here 36360 about 3622 okay 365 all right help now we know half way is about 150 185 and then that is about 360
help can that help us figure out you know where each person was no what are we trying to find right where does 301 belong on this line
no well can we at least say that it is on this side or it is on this side right and how about shaquille it is also on the right fourths now what would be half half of that
okay 92 and this is about 180 yeah close enough okay so 184 okay how about over here you want to be exact another 4292 to that right 272270 272
and here 5454340 wow okay now can does this help 301 half and a half it would be between 272 and 371 right
451 in between yeah it would be between these 2 between one half and 3 fourths so so does this help us okay yes i was exact right okay so if you use benchmark numbers you should be able to okay
let us say if this does not work then we can break it down into even smaller parts right bar okay let us let us take a look at that that last one and i think that is a very good question
disagree okay this person alicia said yao ming made 301 free throws and shaquille 0 neal made 451 so shaquille 0 neal has the better record
hand marlene i disagree because shaquille 0 neal had an elbow but not shaquille so so you disagree that means what does that mean that yao ming has a better record yes
okay does anyone disagree with marlene is statement and that means you agree with alicia is in other words can we say that shaquille actually has the better record no so you all agree with marlene yes okay but what is the difference if you look at these 2 numbers
just the ones in purple not the denominator just the what are these numbers right so he made yao ming made that many shaquille 0 neal made that many is it possible to argue that he is better he has a better record
yes because you it depends because you do not know the denominator okay all right because you do not know the denominator because well we do know do not we know okay yes but it you know we do know the denominator so yes
i just i recognize this right now but like you could say that yao ming has more because if you -3 72 301 then you only have like only like 70 left like any missed and then if you -125 or 451 you will have a lot more than okay how many 200
2 hundered and 76 okay so you are saying that shaquille missed many more shots than yao ming so he is better
okay the lower the denominator then the cole the denominator yeah and the numerator 0 and the numerator the higher the percentage it is
lower so how about fraction like 13rd these are low right does that mean it is a higher percentage what determines i think cole brought up a good point okay
what determines the the higher a higher percentage percentage just by looking at the numerator and the denominator tell yeah rachel a higher numerator because then no the numerator should be very high because it has to be like close to the numerator to the denominator say that one more time for me
it has to be of course the numerator to the denominator okay so can we say that when the numerator is very close to the denominator that the percentage is higher point okay so what i would like you to think about now is the other strategies that you wrote down
3rd okay so this is one strategy right down estimate rounding
okay maybe we can write this down too okay so this is not finding the exact percentage but we can estimate right
what yes by rounding and using benchmark numbers yes
okay all right so this is a strategy for estimating not finding the exact okay so let us think about what .
see what i wrote up here okay over okay you all set with this okay when you estimate you round
use fraction or percent bars right
okay let us say there is a fraction but you can not round the 100 you cannot scale up or down you know to get to 100 and and then you cannot estimate because you want the exact answer okay then what do you do example how about one out of 3
can we scale this up or down to make this 100 into 100 how does this work boys and girls no we can have 26s 39s one over 30 but how do we get to a 100
we can not not example now what happens when you need to make a percent you you can not estimate then it is that is a problem okay and this is when the next strategy comes in handy okay
down divide a denominator before yes what do you get when you do that you have a decimal right
okay so when you have the decimal and then what how do you make it into a percent a percent okay
okay did you write this down okay so when you cannot do any of the other use any of the other strategies you use this one okay and and it always works okay with this one you divide a numerator by the denominator okay
example they are all one over 3 okay so it is 3 divided by one so it is 33% 33 well one out of 3 how can that be 3% right that does not make sense because you do 3 divided by one are we dividing 3 by one
no okay i know it does not look very it does not look right but we remember this when we did this dylan yeah one divided one over 3 and what does this symbol mean divide on the keyboard the computer keyboard that means divide right so when you write you can write it like this
so this is the same as that same as that right yes so how do you divide one by 30 and i think we did this okay
put a 0 put a 0 so this is one and 0 tenths 3 goes into 10th that how many times no so this is 110th if we do the standard way then what happens after a while you notice that it repeats right
okay so whenever it repeats then you do not have to go on because it will not stop okay and we put the little line okay above this and that means it repeats okay so 13rd is the same as 0.30.3 with that bar notation okay at the top
now that is only a decimal so how do we turn the decimal into a percent we move the decimal if you do not put you move 2 spaces back which is it is 0.33 that is 33 but since it is only .3 you put 13rd into it
so since it is all over here there is 0.33 and behind the decimal points it also makes a percent so we need to move that okay and that is what we did i think last month instead of writing the decimal especially when it repeats we made we did not use the remainder right
marlene so we turned that into a fraction a fraction do you put the 13rd at the top here right
and 3rd so this decimal is and is it should we do 0.3 and a 3rd no or 3333 okay 33 because we as jackie said you have to move the decimal point how many spaces
right okay so that means over okay so this is the exact decimal right that is not estimating that is not rounding and you turn it into a percent
33 okay and of course you think about it does it make sense 13rd is that about 33% 333333 that is about a 100 right okay
page and remember sometimes okay you have to scale up scale down and if it does not work then you use this last strategy okay on page 57 the portland tigers are playing the cold water colts colts in basketball
the game is tied 58 to 58 but in the excitement both coaches step onto the court just as the buzzer sounds a referee calls a technical foul on each coach so each coach has to choose one player to make the free throw attempt
the winning team may be determined by the free throw and the question is you know who does the coach choose right statistics so for angela angela is history okay when you know she made the free throw so she made 12 out of 15 free throws
20 christina 13 out of 16 so which player should the coach select to make the free throw attempt and explain your reasoning okay so i want you to do this in your notebook i want you to figure out you know each one and maybe what is the strategy
how do we i mean can we just look at these numbers and say 0 this is the best person in free throw do we have to show our work okay you show your work show your thinking but how do you determine you know who okay so you will have to do some math to find percent right or equivalent fraction so you can compare
lawrence can you make them so they have numerators of a 100 okay you can try to make them so that they all have a 100 you know as a numerator denominator or numerator
okay so go ahead and do it in your notebook okay and let me know if you have any questions
because 150 probably 15 equals 4 and to get one a denominator of 100 you have to multiply by 20
so when you multiply something by 20 does it get 20 times as much up okay i see what you are doing but if you write it like this that means you multiply this by 20 more so what is the what is the right way to write that
you multiply this by 20 and you multiply this by 20 also like a numerator and how is that different 20 versus 20 over 20 20 if you do that you are just multiplying that whole thing 20 times
okay why do you think christina is the best at free throw same because the quickest way to do it that i found out was 3 +3 equals 16
2 it is the easy way if you use if 13 goes into 16 even if these 2 have 3 she had more time to go for free throws than 13 so she got 13 out of 16 and it would be a little it would just be a little bit the percentage would just be a little bit more than this because this has a more because she had more time and then she had 13
okay they had different right that is very good thinking but if you look at the the numbers of attempts okay they all did different they they they used different numbers right yes so how can you figure out the exact percent for angela the exact for emily
can you use any of those strategies you could divide the denominator by the denominator okay now before you do that can we use the other strategies sometimes those are easier okay than dividing right remember we are trying to find fractions that have a denominator of of 150 or like a benchmark 25
yes so can you turn that into a 100 15 maybe you can write it down and yeah put it on this page so we can see
does 15 go into 100 evenly no right so that 1st strategy okay that does not work up if you scale it up it would be 24 over 30
100 try to scale it down and see if that works so do 12 over 15 equal
okay because 15 goes into 106 times is it exactly 6 times numbers is there another way to remember the strategies that we talked about
like 15 to 10 and then yeah can you try to scale it up scale it down
3 because 12 times 4 okay and a 3 times 4 equals 12 20 that is not 20
so how many percent is that 80% good so that is an example of scaling down okay in order to go back up right good okay how did you do this one ming
the common factor okay 20 so what is that 15 out of 20
fraction in other words you turn that into a fraction 15 i made this 20 because if it is rounded down it will be 10 200 and now now we can not round okay why not
estimating can you write that fraction here 12 over 15 equal and we are trying to find a fraction that has a 100 at the bottom right good so then so let us try those strategies
one by scaling can you scale down scale down that means make these 2 numbers smaller but yet they still equal the same okay good good okay
works yeah so i have 100 times 12 12 i have 100 times 12 did you get that exactly and what percent is that
80% so this is a case when you have to round that not round but scale them before you can get to 100 right good so so angela that is 80%
20 so these are common factors they both have 5 good so 15 times 5 equals 75 so i turn it into a fraction 20 times 5 equals 100 so i turn this into a fraction okay and then 75 out of 100 that is 75 75% very good are you trying to use the same way to find emily or are you using a different strategy
okay i am using a all right remember i used the i did it see so this one is both and this one is okay what do you mean both me because 15 out of i put equal because if i round it all up to the 20 so i put 15 +5 will equal 20 so i put 12 +5 now why did you round up
round remember when we do you need this i am all set fong so why do you why why do you need to round
here so this is not estimating okay fraction it is not the same 12 over 15 good it is 2 away and can you use any of those strategies scaling up and down turning the denominator into a 100
did that work can you tell me what you did
cause 12 over 15 equals 4 fifths 15th equals 8 over a 100 good and then now do you know the percent 8% good now okay so that is the 2nd strategy what is the last one
divide the numerator okay i need you to show your work
shots so she missed 5 shots 3 so .
so you are trying to say that this person missed the least therefore no because angela also missed 3 but christina had more free throws and angela had less so christina would have had a better chance okay now how about someone who missed one free throw do you think that would be like even better than christina
one does that mean i am better than christina no no 0 that does not yeah so what does that mean can we can you determine by these numbers the number that they missed carmen carmen or bobby carmen not right now dylan okay
please does that work do you need to find the 8 out of 10 exact percent right percent 18 out of 10 attempts can you go back and yep
15 can you write 12 over 15
exactly you see that is a fraction out of this not out of the whole okay we are going to take a few more minutes boys and girls but i one thing i need you to do is to make sure that you write the fraction you show your work okay you that you do not estimate okay
we are not estimating so you need the exact fraction percent one all right so how many percent is this
know because i changed it into a fraction which is 3 fourths right so what is re this is 3 fourths how did you make that into a 34th i i scaled it to 66 over i believe 8 all right now 6 that is half of that right that no
estimating yes okay so we can not use anything that is close to but i think you have the you have the right idea lewis so can you scale it differently okay maybe you can just write the fraction here and try to reduce it try to scale it
down yes or simplify simplify it down to 6 okay okay does that work that is half of that and i do not think so 15 is that an even number
that try another number you can do let us see 4 okay okay divided by 3 good so that is worth this right now does that help
yes how do you go from here to the percent parts is this exactly the same as that 80% okay good because these are very close and how do you know if you did these lines accurately
you can tell that she is a little bit better than angela right evenly that this is not a little bit more than that how about using some numbers
okay now since these are so close can you try to use some numbers to figure out okay boys and girls we have a couple more minutes
let me have your attention okay just for a minute up here okay so for angela okay since we are not estimating okay i need you to find the exact number okay so what is the what is the fraction there how many out of how many
kevin all right and you want to find a remember those strategies 100 yes okay so if 15 does 15 go into 100 evenly
no okay if not then we will have to use another strategy right to okay does that work
divided by 3 divided by 3 and then can you scale it up 5 can go into 100 right okay and now we have a fraction alphonsus okay now for the other 2 people you need to do the same thing
so emily and christina what do you notice about the last one down can we scale up
100 now that means strategy one does not work strategy 2 does not work and we can not estimate that strategy 3 so we have to go to the last one right for something like this you will have to divide okay
so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0
1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20
right so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say 0 my account is negative that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had
so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30 $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game golf but also like video games sometimes right
i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative it will say minus the point or minus however many points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true
so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah there are negative numbers on a thermometer we talked yesterday about the thermometer right so we looked at it 2 different ways right this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right this side has fahrenheit and celsius
and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right what were some of the landmark numbers we talked about remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what do you remember what the celsius is when it is 32 degrees fahrenheit it is what temperature in the celsius
temperature freezing temperature of water that is right 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and we talked about what was that temperature 212 i think it was 212 boiling water boiling of water
okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home do any of you notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right but some people still have these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you
some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water it it shows the temperature there right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers
you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer during what season winter right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers
so going back to the chart it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer we just talked about that in golf there are scores with negative numbers so how many of you watch golf do any of you or play golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3
easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole score what did you say one because there it was expected you would need 4 strokes hitting the ball 4 times to get the ball in the hole one and the more the higher your negative number the better you are doing because that is how many strokes under par
so if you did exactly 4 strokes if it took you 4 times hitting the ball to get it into the hole you would be on par which means your score would be 0 if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game
so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right
and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right where do we expect warmer temperatures all year long location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long arizona because it is closer yep
temperatures where did we notice the coldest temperatures no matter and the poles right pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time
off so i am going to start out by showing you the game board so this game is called number line tug of war
this think about what you think the object of the game might be yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game look at the spinner at your table talk to a partner
game what do you think but how how are you going to win
go to table 4 isaiah come over here segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
all you need is a pencil aaron michael can you go see if they are at the end of the hallway because i accidentally just pressed something and i do not know if i turned it off yes 0 let us wait 12nd so .
i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again is that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something so i just want to make sure it is still working so .
nothing uhh so look at the game board again i am going to remind you what you are thinking about 2 you see stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no
do where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working let us just keep going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what
less than 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do
you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay
no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place what positive number 10 right negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right you are trying to get to the end
ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right okay one of the things that we need to do on here
line a number line right so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light
game well yes but i am talking about with the number line yeah label it right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10
you got to pay attention isaiah now we are going to label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right the numbers that are greater than 0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers
here -one -one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0
and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10 so what kind of numbers are they hoping to spin on the spinner -negative numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right
so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner see it fits really well right it lines up paperclips so we start team one at 00 you always have to keep in mind your goal
10 team 2 is trying to get to -10
question so yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2 negative they are at -4 now they still have to move back up
you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right
way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10
bradley and isaiah you need to be focused and paying attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop all right so i think we will just divide the class in half
up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right so he is at 0 to 3 so you can move right on the line very good so i need someone from team 2
nicely so now what should your team be thinking -negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left next yep 0 +3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to
okay alexander your hand came up 1st so you are thinking -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place all right michael come on up
all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are bradley come on up
remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game 0 +3 so which way do we have to move so you would go 0 that is 112 okay good job remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right
game noisha come on over be a positive okay +one there you go okay jasmine come on up
he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012 okay makes sense all right who has not come up yet kobe come on up
there is lots of people whose hands are raised you have to be patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you yes win 33 +3 let us see
one the front group is going to be team 2 so what is your goal now positive 10 wait a minute stop for a minute if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line we are +10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal -10 right where do we need to start both team pieces at
0 okay so team one
that was nice of you bobby to point out who did not go so remember you are thinking negative right +3 hold on no wait a minute that is team one you are team 2 now yet orion come on up hi
game so +one do yeah so wait a minute you are on -3 they are moving one so you are at -2 okay who has not come up on this side
so you are going to move where no +2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment so right now let us stop for a minute
to negative not -10
all right alicia did you come up yet yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down get 33 then you just move up one and you have won
okay that was a good question miguel come on up see we are both kind of in the wrong place right now right team one is in the negative they want to be in the positive team 2 is in the positive they want to be in the negative table 4 orion you need to be paying attention the whole time
on wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 very good okay who has not come up yet on this noisha do you come up yet
up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is
up uhh i hope everyone is listening 0 up let us see
let us try to quiet down and focus remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up
arnina and davina i know 0 and aaron ready so you are going to try and get a -3 very good you are at 5 so where are you going to go to up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening -2 so you are at 0 so now where do you have to go
hey all right bobby come on up
excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now so +2 come over here you have to move hey kobe come on up
he went up once now we are on everyone is 2nd turn so remember what number you are trying to get -one all right wait a minute kobe you are going to move the game piece very good okay 0 tire will be next all right alicia come on up
not -one +one up table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3 wait a minute yes so you are at -3 where do you need to go to
up can not move that yep +3 hold on you are going to move it up i like the way jasmine is sitting quietly i like the way some people are sitting up
nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts 2 go ahead very good okay nathan come on up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward he had +one
yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward he did it at 1st and then he went back and fixed it
up come on rocco so +one
come here michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that
so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom segala come on up 0 that is okay okay noisha come on up
you had 712 okay it is almost 10 0 and at that time i wanted to start you playing partners so we have enough time for 2 more people to come up and spin one so anthony come on up
yes and then tire you can be the 2nd one so +2
go very good angel i mean tire sorry sorry angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin -2
now 7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here board we said we were stopping the game here
now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10 why is team one the winner alexandra cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so 3 how far is team 2 from their goal
18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner so does everyone understand how to play the game yes i think i think this game is rigged do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute that is something you can investigate when you are working with your partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns
time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips you are going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right since you are playing against each other what is the vocabulary term for that
what what do we call people who are playing against each other opponents that is right or foe yes another way you could say it is rival who just said that why would you do that why
yes anthony go give them and everyone has a game board you know who you are playing with right where do you need to start your game pieces goal what is their goal +10
goal i am asking you a question doing 0 bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line
some of you already did it
you are going to make sure be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
you know anything you should do go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet
let me hold it for now you finished who won 2 so now you are going to switch segala will be team one and you will be team 2
so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10
yes then we switch right team if you were team one now you will be team 2 if you were team 2 now you will be team one
how is it going on the bottom okay fine yeah this is our 2nd game your 2nd how many games have you played 3 who is won so far both times 0 you each won once when you are being +10 or -10
you were negative anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
but that shows that you can win when you are negative where are you you are moving in the wrong direction right now
so how many places away are you from your goal 20 10 if you have to go 10 to 0 and then -10 to -10
for i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at -0 my
paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers
what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair okay
okay so you are given kind of a big challenging problem at the bottom of the list and those those related problem sets those clusters are the those clusters are there to help you break down the bigger problem okay and in past experience nancy we have had to create our own problems right we have had to make arrays and break those larger problems down on our own and be creative and think about how to do that
but in this case you do not necessarily have to be as creative to even give us a list of problems to choose from so that was pretty helpful was not it
okay so we did set a together but i want to show you an example of something that you will be working on this morning you are going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner so here is my example i have chosen set a since we already solved a together on friday so what you are going to do is here is your list of directions i am going to give you and a partner a split and on that split is one of the sets on your sheet
the only one that is not represented is a because i am doing a for you so i took a out of the possibilities so you might get set b c all the way to f you do not know which set you are going to get
that is why i asked you to be prepared over the weekend and come in with them all finished already you are just going to add a little bit of some work to that today okay
yes so here is an example of what this will look like
he is making sense of breaking down the problems a little bit different is that okay to do is that okay yeah so if you are working with a partner on the same set is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem yeah
what do you think brian yeah do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses me pay attention pay attention who can answer my question who why because the 4 of us may think a different way
so i did set a 4 x 10 is 40 4 x 40 is 160 4 x 3 is 12 and 2 x 43 is 86
43 so what made sense for me when i was figuring out what to use to solve this was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 is it the only way i could have done it
all i have to do is what add the what chris what is that word with the p
the products right i have to add the products from each of these and it gives me the product for the final one so i did not really have to do any extra work did i
so that made sense for me are there other ways i could have solved it certainly but i only have to solve it in one way for this purpose madam yes
okay any other are there any other questions no
okay so i am picking partners when i pick your partners i want you to come to me and i am going to give you each a slip
you might end up sitting at other people is desks and that is fine with me just please be thoughtful of their belongings do not touch things that do not belong to you
but we are going to be working at desks so whatever partner you get with you need to find a desk to work at
you can not work on the same desk okay clear and like i always say your partner is your partner for now
get your slips one for each of you
edna nancy and josue alvin and edna catherine and mario and christopher and arlene s
and caroline and carlos you have 2 students absent and you are still even which is good carlos and caroline no
all right so are we settled and how are you working together i just want to get the answers all right so how are you working together okay so is 50 10 x 5
so the 50 is 10 x 5 so will this answer be 10 x 5 so how about 10 x 30 right okay so will this answer be 10 x this product so how will i get that product think about it
i will be back back up a little bit
i do not know where you are with this okay so you chose in order to solve 70 x 5 you chose this
so this is 5 +7 +7 equals 9 right and here i have 76 which is one so after you choose this one you choose this one
71 all right so right here so the other problem is 70 x 5 right how is 70 x 5 related to this you already know the answer to 70 x 5
it is 80 x this okay and then what is the difference between these 2 problems this is 70 x 5 and this is 5 +7
so how many more groups of 5 is this and then you change the number so if you do 70 x 5 you get this and if you do 6 more x 5 you get this all right that is it and you have to do it this way all right you are going to do it this way
it is not going to be hard anymore and so did you figure out the answers to your small problem yet
2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6 this is 2 groups of 58 right how many groups of 58 are there 2
how many x do i have to make this array to match this problem do you guys agree with me on this 3 x 3 x total or 3 more x why and i only have 2 here but there is 6
so there is 6 here if i were to make this 3 more x .
what do i do to all these to get to the answer so what i asked originally was what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
it just happened about how i need 2 more of those so i would say this is only 2 more x
that would mean that i have 4 of them with all of them amy what would you do with these 3 problems i agree why would you add them all
you yeah i agree with you each one is just too big to carry right so why would you add them all
when i add up all of the units of 116 how many units of 58 do i have 6 how many units 6
so you need to put your own symbol on the list so 50 x okay so you start with what is on the list and then you decide to make your own problem which is 8 x 6
okay i like that you did that and that this is definitely going to get you to the answer which is 8 x 6
however there is a multiplication here and so it is going to affect your result what is 8 x 6
4 are you going to use your partner can you use karla to support you
okay well let me tell you what this means for you
b yes okay and did you work together to solve the smaller problems yes
okay let us back up a little bit let me ask you this what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
how many 2s are in 53 so how many times would you have to do 58 x 2 to get to 58 x 33 and let us maybe we can draw an array and see if that works out
way all right so you and chris which sector did you choose 6
have a seat and i will come to you
did you each get the same answer of 248 and did you solve it the same way 58 caroline this 50 x 6 is different than what you were doing here you chose 58 x 2 earlier 58 x 2
this is what all this work represents 58 x 2 your array is here your equation is here your addition is here and then why did you start talking about a different problem there is it just a mistake what should this problem say
is it 50 x 6 that you used or 50 x 2 that you used 50 x 2 is what you used you could have used 50 x 6 but you did not did you
and just re read your explanation to make sure it is exactly what you wanted to say
you can still talk about fractions if you want to but 2 is not half
2 and what did you do with it and i how many x did you do 58 x 2
2 is 13rd of 62 +2 +2 is 6
it is complex is this on time or no time a couple minutes a couple minutes i want to pause you
and i do want to have a couple minutes of a debrief is there any could i have one group one partnership that is close to being finished to come up and kind of talk about what they did
we can have 2 groups if we have time arlene you sort of raised your hand
i know you are not fully done with your poster and that is fine but could you could you still come up could you still come up here and talk about it
on everybody else is pausing please caroline sit down all the way on the bottom i was working on set c okay what was the final problem you were going to solve 32 x 8
okay was there were there any other partners working on set c no okay so listen carefully think about whether you did it similarly differently or or what i used 32 x 8 okay so the main problem is 32 x 8 and you did 30 x 8
that because i needed to add 8 to what how many quarters of 8 do you need you did 30 you did 30 x 8 how many more quarters of a do you need for 32 x 8
all right all eyes up here let us tell barbie so your major problem is your final difficult problem is 32 x 8
8 what else would arlene need to do she did 30 groups of 8 how many groups of a does she need to have
32 so how many more groups of of 8 do you need 2 more groups of 8 right you still have to multiply this 2 by the 8
you did the 30 x the 8 but you have to multiply all the parts of this number by this number so i still need the 2 x 8
so you have this answer right which is what 240 and so how many more or how much more do you have to add with 2 x 8 you so what happens when you combine 30 groups of 8 +2 groups of 8
what do you get as a total 256 very good very good thank you one more group one more partnership caroline do you want to come up
it you did a lot of work over there come on up you have no problem speaking up right okay what was your set
b okay set b which is what but what is the final problem carlos what is the final problem in set b 6 who else did set b
any other partners adrian are you paying attention are you paying attention it does not look like it can you show me that
into i broke it into 6 the 6 yeah so caroline took the and caroline and carlos took the 6 and they broke it into 32s 246 and then so what was 58 x 2
x does that make sense okay usually we take the big problem and we make 2 smaller problems but with caroline she made it made more sense to her to do 3 problems because she used the 58 x 2 and what did you get as your answer so all these groups of 2 add up to the 6 and the 58 of 30348 who else did group set b
and abraham and aiden what did you get 348 is your answer all right so we are going to pause on that i know that none of you know their poster
okay she likes to be sat in closets all right things we talked a little bit about the area model on friday today okay some of the kids had trouble in the other class simple okay hand down maneli
and then we are going to also use estimation to help us get in the right ballpark as far as our answers go okay way so let us talk about estimation 1st take out your math notebooks and let us copy this problem down
25 x 84 okay
why is it why is it a good strategy to do bella because it makes it easier because you will have even numbers okay but how is it going to help us like why why are we estimating why am i estimating right now before why do not why do not i just solve the problem
know because it might help us how is it going to help us us maneli it is going to help explain what you are thinking or .
patrick it is going to help us because it makes it easier okay i need something a little more clearer than that benny like it it makes it easier how does it make it easier
patrick to to make an estimation and make an estimation and get close to the answer okay it is going to help us get close to the answer which will help us do what if we estimate it is going to help us get close to the actual answer
why is that important why is that important so you can find the answer so we can find the answer because what i have been seeing a lot okay so let me do another problem right here what i have been seeing a lot is when people are multiplying okay when people are multiplying say i have a problem and i am doing it this way
22 x 46 what i am seeing a lot is that people are not multiplying accurately so you are not doing say you did 80 instead of 800 well your answer is going to be way off so you need to recognize that you know what i need to add one more 0 there to make it 800
and i have seen it in the previous class i saw it a lot at the beginning and i am and i see it in this class as well so if i estimate if i take 22 x 46 and i estimate that if i round the numbers up to 20 x 50 i know that my answer is going to be somewhere around a 1000
so whittler if i did make a mistake and i forgot to add a 0 and i did have 80 hopefully when i am done adding my products up i say to myself something is not right my estimate my estimation my estimate i am going to be close to a 1000
over but i know i am not going to get an answer of say 220 so it is going to help you realize that when you are computing when you are multiplying your partial products together that you know what i think i might have left out a 0
mistake so it will help us become more accurate 84 when we estimate we round we have 2 digit numbers 10 25 30 30 good so let us put it underneath i like to write an e for estimate for an estimate just so you know
30 okay 84 80 80 good ah multiplying with 0s right
0s 2400 so i know i am going to be somewhere around 2400 okay one of the kids at the end of the class in the previous class one of the word problems on that paper that you have excuse me
when he when he did it his estimate was actually the same as the actual answer will not so i know i am going to be 30 x 80
friday okay let us go kyle solve it any way we want solve it any way you want rectangle okay that is the way we were practicing us okay that is just to help us
25 x 84 i see ella is already working there now 25 x 84
84 25 x 84 good 0 thank you
one okay is it all coming back to you now
go good just be accurate with your multiplication 2400 all right so let us 25 84
20 x 80 0s 16 are all . how many 0s are in the equation how many 0s
22 1600 right 20 x 4 48 and add a 0 right 80 okay now we go to the bottom
0 400 5 x 4 is yes and then this will be the answer that will be the answer yes just do not add up the numbers on the outside
there okay 0 bottom right
see 0 wait no you you made the boo boo right there i did too no you were good do you recognize the boo boo recognize the mistake 40 last time i checked 5 x 8 is 40
good good i will be right there good good yeah no there you have got to add all these up
good ah mistake right here right 84 is the number right that i know 0 i love it
i see the same mistake all the time and this is why i am going to show you the area model 840 no 0 you copied it different okay let me see yes you are right you are right good all right
let us have okay 4 x 2 huh 8 4 x 2
488 so that should be 8 right all right whittler let me see
wrong bring your bring your paper up answer okay whittler tell us what you multiplied
80 yes and what did we get as an answer 1600 1600 somebody refresh my memory about what the estimate was sara 2400 2400 i am going to just write that up here
estimate okay what did we multiply next we multiplied 5 x 4 we got 20 continue then we multiplied 5 x 80
good then we multiplied 20 x . 20 x what 20 x 4 and you got 8
2400 are we in the right ballpark yes right now this is what i saw a lot today this is what i saw from at least 3 different people
you did 5 x 80 and you put 40 8 you did not add the 0 from the 80 to get 400 okay so that is a mistake that a lot of people make just because you are going and sometimes you forget well if we look at the area model here i know i talked a little bit about it on friday
somebody refresh my memory about how the area model you can go back to your seat you actually keep your notebook there for a 2nd i will give it back to you you can sit down so you can see this how the area model here is different from the strategy on the board
how is the area model different from the strategy on the board
patrick can you answer the numbers are probably like 20 will be bigger and 10 times will be smaller okay he is on the i know what he is saying but let us get it exact means but let us say it exactly the way it should be
bella you did 30 going down and you did so that means you did one going down right 5 yes so would it be like area basically the length and the width are going to be i am looking for a word precise that begins with an a
exact no that is an e but that is another word what the length and the width are going to be accurate accurate accurate yes the length and the width are going to be accurate the rectangles inside the area model are going to show what they are really supposed to look like
so when i multiply with this one they do 38 x 26 so when i do 30 x 20 the answer is 600 the value of that product is going to look bigger than the other ones because i am multiplying the 2 biggest numbers together
with this one up here okay this one is kind of like what they call the partial product okay we just write the equations now we do it in that rectangle because you guys and gals were having a hard time figuring out what numbers to multiply so that is a strategy that helps us organize the partial product okay this one is showing how big the rectangles inside the area should be
so when i am doing 30 x 20 hopefully if i put 60 there i realize that whoa that rectangle is way too big to be 60 0 well this little one i am going to know where to put that equation of 8 x 6
8 x 6 is by far the smallest equation there so it better go in the small rectangle right in the bottom right today okay and if you like the area model you can continue using it if you do not like it you can go back to using the partial product accurate you have to recognize your mistakes when you make one
so if i left out a 0 i know that i have to add that 0 okay that yes okay let me show you an example of what one of the kids did in class this i am not sure why
counting so our goal today is to make the area model as you can see up here now this is an area model of 38 x 12
okay and if we get the hang of this then i will break you up into your groups you can solve the word problems on your desk in your groups and then you can have all the work if we have time well so look at what one of the students did
12 okay so the length they did 30 right 38 i am just going to make a little line there
notation so they counted 30 alana and tiana 30 down with one color and then 8 down with another so we separated the 10s place from the ones place there
good you would be surprised at what i saw last class all right 12 so again she separated according to place value she did 10 across and then 2 across okay now i used grid paper for this to help us out boxes all you do is you make a line
so if the number is 38 i do 30 with one color and then 8 with another and then i can use the same 2 colors for the width or i could use 2 different colors matter and i went 10 across and then she went 10 across and then 2 across now the reason why we use 2 different colors
where the 10s place and ones place meet is right here this section right here separates the 10s place from the ones place there and that will help us get the correct areas for each equation that we multiply
so when she did 10 x 8 say you did not know your facts at all but you could make the area model 10 x 8 there is going to be 80 little squares in here them 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and you can get your answer okay and it is going to help you because if you get stuck and you are like mister
porter i do not know what numbers i have to add would it make sense if you did 8 x 10 in this rectangle right here 16 if you came up here and you counted that there would be 16 boxes
now the horizontal line where the 2 different colors meet is where you draw your line that i had kids just to warn you i had kids making the line the vertical line anywhere they wanted to
here so when they went to go do it it did not look right accurate if i counted those squares there should be 80 squares here if we counted this there should be 300 squares in that rectangle right there because that is the area rectangle there should be 60 squares here
so this is going to be a lot more accurate than doing it with the partial product in the rectangle okay problems i am going to pass out this type of paper okay understand yes okay we are going to do the 1st one together if i feel like we are getting it and we can do it then i am going to break you up into your groups
okay and you are going to use the area model to help you solve the word problems and some of you i have different word problems for different groups okay
too once we do it with the centimeter paper here okay once we are done with that then we can move on to doing it without it just using a regular piece of paper right so let us see
everybody emily i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody so everybody should have 2 pieces of paper okay
because we are going to do one problem per side
the goal is to be so good at making the area model you can do it as quick as making the other rectangle okay now i am going to show you when i do it on the board i am not going to use any graph paper to help me
make sure you do not forget benny in the back okay so take out 2 colored crayons 32 x 24 let us write the problem at the top of your paper
paper sara can you give them another one you is that for whoever is like watching us
down they are watching me more than they are watching you what they are watching me teach more than they are watching you they are not watching the program they are showing how i teach okay okay so 32 x 241st before we even begin we are going to estimate
because when we estimate it is going to help us get in the right ballpark help us know where our answer should be round not exactly so 32 alex what am i going to round 32 to what number 30 30 good 24 chris 20 200 that is nice and easy
and once you get good at estimating it is something that you can just do in your head can some of you might take a little more practice 62600 see how quick you did that right question is it going to be smaller or larger than 600
why why is our answer going to be smaller or larger than 600 why jasmine we have not heard from you all day jasmine why is our number is our actual answer going to be smaller or larger larger
i only rounded the 10s so you said i only rounded the 10s and you have to round the ones alex we rounded down with both of the numbers there you go are 32 come on people 32 so they are larger
larger so of course our answer is going to be larger okay our actual numbers 32 and 24 are both larger than 30 and 20 so our answer is going to be greater than 600 if you had an answer smaller than 600 that should raise a red flag okay goodness i should have the camera emily who is also well behaved
24 so what you are going to do is you are going to take a color you are not going to color in any of the squares there it and my rectangle that i make my area is going to look just like yours we are going to do 30 down so count 30 draw a line and then label it
and then you are going to take a different color and you are just going to do 2 because that would represent the ones place 32 now you can do this without actually drawing without using graph paper once you get the handle of it
now obviously 30 is going to be a lot greater than 2 okay go is it like this is it 30
down yes sure okay 30 2 and write 2 now my only question is you did it so far over here i do not think you are going to have room to draw 24 going in a horizontal line right
left you do not look like you where do you want to go i did not . where is 30 30 down 30 down a line 30 down can you count 30 down ahead start at yeah there you go
30 that is not 30 honey yes okay that does not look like 30 to me my dear
13 you have 14 there 30 i want a line of 30 and then with another color a line of 2
it let me see yes why why are you coloring that in 30 i can walk by and i notice that she has a line of 32 any concerns right now
who can not draw a line count by 30 going down 30 okay because i am not seeing it 30 it looks okay from the yeah 20 yeah now what bella is going to do is she is going to take a color and the number is 24
20 not 15 not 10 not 19 20 stop she is going to use another color to count 4 yes go ahead thank you thank you you can still do it
20 that looks more than 30 on 123456 is that 20 there now with another color make 4
place from right extended perfect okay so that is what ella just did okay
32 then she has 20 across and then 4 across right now all ella has to do she is basically done is she just has to close up the area model so she just takes any color she wants and she is going to close up the rectangle
so she is going to take a color she is going to draw up and over so now we have a rectangle that yes okay make it happen you have a question anybody we are doing 20 on the bottom yeah we are doing 24
24 array basically okay did you have enough room good is that 20
now you have to do another 4 square yeah because we are doing the number 24 24 even though i think that is more than 30 buddy but that is okay
yes there is 10 20 there is 30 right there be so there is 30 here is 2
here okay you see that you see that okay once you have made your rectangle close it up no 241 number
21234 okay now i have chris is paper right here now all right that is what we are doing is we are making an array
now the reason why i had you use different colors is so you know where to draw the lines here so where his orange and red vertical line meet he is going to draw a line going across is hopefully he will draw it straighter than i just did
hey hey hey that was not good so he is going to draw it across on the line and then where his horizontal line is is where the 20 meets the 4 here okay let me write it up okay right here counted he is going to draw a line going up
now if he solves it rightly if he counted this he will be able to accurately know the product for each equation that he is going to make that yes okay so draw you are going to draw a horizontal and a vertical line if you do not know good perfect
yours vertical and horizontal okay vertical astronaut remember astronauts sleep because in space because of . gravity no gravity
there now when she multiplies i hope she is going to realize where she puts 2 x 4 right and if you put 2 x 4 in this rectangle right here we have some . big problem we have a little bit of concern right so this is going to help us accurately find the answer to the product to each of the rectangles
rectangles so you are going to have 4 equations you can write the equation right inside each of them maybe not that one because it is so small okay there you go calista i will be right back is this perfect yes perfect
together you made a loop you are not going to be and you can still get the answer but you do not have 32 here 31 see that how you only have one right there see how he has 2 rows right 0 yeah
who ellis emily is this is emily is yes that is ellis and this is emily is perfect okay multiply them together here draw a line here all the way across
here okay you got it count 2468 is my answer right perfect perfect it solve it
alex alex wrote 24 on the top and the bottom helps kyle can you look here so we can do it right bud right so he did 30 x 20 now if i wanted to torture alex which i might later on i might have him count every single square here and if he counted every single square there would be 600 because 30 x 20 is 600
awesome 600 i like how he wrote the equation inside the inside the rectangle perfect so he has 4 arrays here 20 then below this he wrote 20 here look he is going to do 2 x 20 and he is going to have 40
if he counted each of those squares there would be 40 squares there 40 so unlike using the rectangle or the box some people call it right which just has 4 even rectangles this is giving us the actual answer for each equation okay
so if you did 30 x 20 and you forgot to add a 0 and you said 60 you should know that you made a mistake is then 2 x 4 is a small equation and we have a small answer and we have a small rectangle there we have a small array right here 8 and then the last one 30 x 4
okay 30 x 4 is 120 array does everybody see that yes yes
over if you used both sides already then just get your other paper papers huh okay i know mister porter okay so the next one
smaller let us do 20 28 x 12 now before we begin we are going to estimate i always want you to yes we are going to do that
estimate so write down the actual problem and then we are going to estimate you should always estimate before you solve the problem some of you chris i feel pretty confident that you could do that in your head right 2nd so 28 chris rounded is what 30 30 10 i mean 12 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
what is 30 x 10 down so we know that 28 x 12 is going to be somewhere around 300 so if we have an answer like 3000 we know that we did something wrong and if we can do the area model correctly we know that we are going to be extremely accurate
12 so that means 28 x 120 the pen do not feel me now his button is flashing is it
me i can not do that tapping thing there it goes okay 12 i am going to separate the 28 into a 20 +8 right
color so the 10s place is going to be a different color than the ones place line once you get the hang of it you will not have to do that okay so 20 with one color
red so i am going to count down 20 right go ahead ella with a crayon 20 and then a different color
place 8 not color but draw a line number i am just separating the 10s place and the ones place okay
12 make sure you count it that like this just like if that is 28 then you did it right questions horizontal line
12 so i might use the same 2 colors time notice that my 10 here is a lot smaller than the 20 paper you still want to be fairly accurate
and then 2 for the 12 smaller okay so i have my l array it does not matter what color it is
okay now where your 2 lines meet you are going to draw 2 lines line and i am going to draw my vertical line
now even though i did not use graph paper i bet you your array that you just made is going to look a lot like mine
here and theirs looks a lot like mine except the lines are straighter right
equations okay okay label 28 good we will draw a line here and draw a line here
perfect and if you get stuck you can count there it does not matter good when you have your area model set up solve the equation people okay you are going to have to rely on jasmine to help you out here
i like friday is friday is my favorite okay instead of just making a rectangle like we did last week what we are doing is we are doing an area model so this is going to be the arrays are going to be exact
there 20 x 10 there is going to be 200 squares right here okay accurate when we do this right all the rectangles are the same yeah i am good okay before the camera leaves let us solve this problem
somebody john tell me an equation 10 x 8 equals 80
8 does it matter if i do 8 x 10 or 10 x 8 no no it does not okay here it goes 80 somebody tell me another equation
prosper 10 x 20 equals 200 it good 20 x 10 equals 200 left 2 more arrays calissa huh 2 x 8 and which one is that going in
bottom right bottom right excellent and then i have one more jordan there is one more array and what is 2 x 20
40 we add up our answers 3 okay and we are all set again 300 300 let us see what we get
56 336 our estimate was 300 our actual answer is 336
and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys yes so they can hear you also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color
3rd i do not have marker colors to match everything i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
again deanthony you have not raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything better who can tell me which color i need to pull out next raise your hand if you can tell me
5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th what do we do now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
really nicholas all the little noises need to stop
please and one 8th is purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths
okay and white is one 6th out one 6th
what hand raised please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking 12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th
one whoa whoa all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things all eyes up here please all hands empty we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again
we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip so you have another way to really see what you are doing when you are adding and subtracting your fractions and we are also going to use them to model multiplication which we have not really done before
in the past few days or probably a week i have asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply if i am doing 3 times 2 what is another way to describe that problem i am multiplying 3 times 2 what are 2 ways to solve that problem
i can just multiply and i know it is 3 times 2 but what is another way paige adding 3 add so multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add 3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times
so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition to figure out how to multiply those fractions
alone so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with so let us try one 12th times 3
how could you solve the problem one 12th times 33 what does that mean 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem
i used i used one of these 12s okay and use all my 3s okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s 3 how many 3s did we need 11
22 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need many okay when we do 3 times 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need 3
31 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please 31 12 ths akasia please share with kyla or share with colby actually 3 or 21 12 ths
2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths nicholas okay is it
show me please show me please i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk it and especially share with jabari paige has her 31 12 ths those line them up next to each other please deshanique do you have your 31 12 ths
desk umm okay got it
one 12th times 3 equals what what is it kendall 3 12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3
if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan thank you
you boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths
i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please 3 12 ths show me on your desk is that it
way maybe it is definitely 14th all right akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths no 14th 14th 14th show me please
me 4 times 3 right here does 14th equals 3 12 ths
yes yes it does 14th equals 3 12 ths yes deshanique umm i would like to find please find how many 16 ths are equal to 14th show me on your desk please
okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to .
this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th 4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th
okay so 14th 0 there it is it is brighter 14th equals okay 16 ths so what kind of multiplication problem could we write .
that 14th times something equals 4 16 ths
ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times .
use i am sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault i wrote that very wrong so 4 16 ths 0 yes here one 16th
girls too many of us are not following the rules i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering this is what it should sound like
malcolm akasia go ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this .
4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths
4 16 ths +one 4th
it 4 16 ths +14th you can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator colby and deanthony stop
i am just trying to get your 4 16 ths +14th akasia you got it figured out already
no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out out panther pride panther pride thank you that is better i am glad you are excited but it is way too noisy
4th i will try to help you get it off the camera it is okay everybody has them in front of them anyway go ahead share with your classmates so how we figured this problem out is empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk
adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla 1st 1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what 4 times 4 equals 6
16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be 4 fourths 4 what right there yep
88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction
it okay so one half also equals everybody everybody 8 16 ths
you okay because you are playing with that i was they were not it does not matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary
here eyes jabari if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions
you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be one 16th times 3 please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3
kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it try good kendall is working it out i got it
it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try too maisie has got it 0 i did it
panther pride ophelia i still see you talking akasia one 16th times 3 equals .
6th one 16th times 3 where are you showing me on your desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
3 16 ths may i have panther pride ian thank you i see that you are quiet
away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths did and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one
okay one times 3 equals 33 and then thank you deshanique thank you ian thank you kendall and nicholas and malcolm okay 16 times one is 16
now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please why did i put the one down here
let us think too though about what 3 divided by one means remember that fractions also represent division problems what 333 divided by one equals 3 so if i write 3 in my numerator and one in my denominator i am really still just writing the number 3
but i can see that when i multiply or add one 16th 3 times i have 3 16 ths kyla turn around please get focused again one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
problem how about 14th times 3 me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip
i do not have a 3rd so i can not show you
easy 14th times 3 deshanique has it fall 3 fourths that is important jabari please show me 14th times 3
me is this 3 fourths right here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths
so jabari what did we figure out
14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction thank you
one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right me too
how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore
try 2 sixths times 4
you 2 sixths times 4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers show me
what is the problem no show me 2 sixths times 4 turn around show me
okay it is not 8 12 ths ian you are going to have to cooperate with these 2
we need to share because 2 sixths times 4 did you make a substitution or
ian thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually
jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
up kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening
2 let me see if i can help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please your classmates are not ready deshanique ophelia we are listening
malcolm you must listen to each other seat kyla put both of your feet on the floor and listen
how did you get those 8 sixths though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening getting better
down put your hands down and pay attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place
many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari
here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down what 2 6 ths times 44 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then
2 sixths times 4 equals 26 times right here nicholas 26 times 4 equals is what 6 ths okay do you see that akasia 1234567
okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction okay
how much whatever you are how many parts 0 parts equal parts how many equal parts
now can i go to the bathroom what was that
yeah of course akasia get started go throw that tissue away
01 half times what please stop chitter chatting they are breaking down yep looks good
i need my bag you do not need your bag
is this wrong miss is this wrong it is wrong what would 3 thirds be
not right now you could do that
you can work it up that way or you can work it up with a strip akasia
spend the next few minutes working without talking kyla akasia already
deshanique we are silent kendall they are here i am sorry nicholas wow
minute paige it is silent time right now
and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys yes so they can hear you also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color
3rd i do not have marker colors to match everything i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
and i am hearing a lot of talking again deanthony you have not raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything better who can tell me which color i need to pull out next raise your hand if you can tell me
what color is next akasia one 5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th what do we do now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
really nicholas all the little noises need to stop all and it disturbs other people around you
please and one 8th is purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths ian how wait where was number one why was that one there
okay and white is one 6th out one 6th yes nicholas uhh
what is one half of one 6th what hand raised please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking
12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th and one 12th is what color blue red red actually it was supposed to be brown blue okay this is one 16th
is yeah okay so red is one
whoa whoa all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things all eyes up here please all hands empty
we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip

3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again
so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition
so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with so let us try one 12th times 3 how could you solve the problem one 12th times 3
3 what does that mean 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem i used i used one of these 12s okay
and use all my 3s okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s 3 how many 3s did we need 111 how many 3s did we need 222
2 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need how many okay when we do 3 times 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need 3
31 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please 31 12 ths akasia please share with kyla or share with colby actually 3 or 21 12 ths what was that 2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths
nicholas okay is it show me please show me please i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk
it and especially share with jabari paige has her 31 12 ths malcolm has has 31 12 ths malcolm can you organize those 12 ths put them in front of you on your desk
12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3
if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan thank you
thank you boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths
i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please 3 12 ths show me on your desk is that it
way maybe it is definitely 14th all right akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths
no 14th 14th 14th show me please
yes yes it does 14th equals 3 12 ths find how many 16 ths are equal to 14th show me on your desk please
okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to .
this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th 4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th
so what kind of multiplication problem could we write that 14th times something equals 4 16 ths
be akasia go ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times 4 fourths is it 4 fourths yes 14th times how many one fourths did we use
sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault i wrote that very wrong so 4 16 ths 0 yes here one 16th
too many of us are not following the rules i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering
malcolm akasia go ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this .
4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths
4 16 ths +one 4th it 4 16 ths +14th
no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out out panther pride panther pride thank you that is better i am glad you are excited but it is way too noisy
12nd let me see if your classmates are listening to you empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk chair deanthony and colby you are listening you are not whispering at all
go ahead so how we solved the problem was we put 16th right here and 14th right here did you put 16th right here how many sixths did you put here how many 4 4 16 ths +14th equals one half can you show me please
adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla
1st 1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what 4 times 4 equals 6
16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be
4 fourths 4 what right there yep
stand up and walk please all right kyla is going to prove to us malcolm and kendall that 14th +4 16 ths equals what kyla
88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction
good okay let us prove it okay so one half also equals everybody everybody 8 16 ths thank you
okay because you are playing with that i was they were not it does not matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary here eyes jabari if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can
it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be
one 16th times 3 please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3 kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it
try good kendall is working it out it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try too maisie has got it
0 i did it panther pride ophelia i still see you talking akasia one 16th times 3 equals one 6th
one 16th times 3 where are you showing me on your desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
3 16 ths may i have panther pride ian thank you i see that you are quiet
away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 0 well the 1st way i knew is because we did it before and did and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one
okay one times 3 equals 33 and then thank you deshanique thank you ian thank you kendall and nicholas and malcolm okay 16 times one is 16
now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please why did i put the one down here
let us think too though about what 3 divided by one means remember that fractions also represent division problems what 333 divided by one equals 3
so if i write 3 in my numerator and one in my denominator i am really still just writing the number 3 but i can see that when i multiply or add one 16th 3 times i have 3 16 ths kyla turn around please get focused again
one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths problem how about 14th times 3 me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip
3 it is easy 14th times 3 it paige has it malcolm has not done it yet
show me please you show me what 14th times 3 looks like did any fall 3 fourths that is important jabari please show me 14th times 3
me is this 3 fourths right here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths
out 14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction thank you one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions
you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right me too how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore try 2 sixths times 4 how would we do that
you 2 sixths times 4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers
2 sixths times 4 turn around show me jabari show me
12 ths ian you are going to have to cooperate with these 2
we need to share because 2 sixths times 4 did you make a substitution or
what thank you ian
thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
up kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening jabari i see you pretty ready
2 let me see if i can help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please your classmates are not ready
deshanique ophelia we are listening malcolm you must listen to each other
how did you get those 8 sixths though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening getting better
down put your hands down and pay attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place
many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari
here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down what 2 6 ths times 44 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then
equals 26 times right here nicholas 26 times 4 equals is what 8 6 ths okay do you see that akasia 1234567
okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction okay
okay so one and 2 sixths once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed mixed number they had one and 2 sixths so jabari how many sixths does it take to make 11 how many sixths does it take to make one how many sixths does it take to make one jabari
us what does the denominator of a number tell us colby
how much whatever you are how many .
yes you may now can i go to the bathroom what was that
01 half times what please stop chitter chatting they are breaking down yep looks good
i need my bag
you do not need your bag
now you could do that
spend the next few minutes working without talking kyla akasia already yes leila umm
akasia please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit
what was that
deshanique we are silent kendall they are here i am sorry
nicholas wow minute paige it is silent time right now
much this is turned on too right yesterday so we are going to add 2 days starting with to our number line
baby the 1st thing you are going to do is write a fraction showing how many days we have been in school so far and we are going to spend just about 10 minutes doing calendar we may not get to everything show me the fraction that tells us how many days we have been in school so far
2 while we are doing this do any of our numbers need part
10 how many more circles will i have before the end of this school year
anything 110 had 2 factors anybody i think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms was i see a lot of equivalent fractions
go 11 over 1811 over 18 that was pretty interesting ha so we could say we have had 11 eighteenths of our school year already that is pretty what fraction tells us how much to go do reduce it
reduce it and they are both divisi and do you remember i see a lot of 35 over 90 so what i want you to do is to look both at 35 and at nintey see if it can be .
year that is what i got too 7 eighteenths and 11 eigteenths those were the 2 numbers them using a less than greater than or equal to symbol compare the fraction that is showing the days we have already done the days we have left m kay good deal alright let us take a look at a couple new things i want to show you
the 1st thing i want us to do is we are going to add days and i wonder if you see it we can create an equivalent decimal
10 colored another 10 number what about using a decimal one and 10 hundredths we also have one one which is one and 110th
can you show me the percent what would the percent be
tomorrow but let us take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month 1st we are going to do it for yesterday and for today
cube turn to your elbow partner and tell them something about a cube yet valentine is day it is a smile and a heart maybe it is part of the pattern it is
it is going to be related to the pattern but we have not seen enough yet
else what else can what other shape can boxes be made into box a rectangle rectangular prism
raised quadrilateral huh quadrilateral well they are not quadrilaterals but they are faces maybe dimensional so how many faces are there 6 think of a dice or a box how many sides are there
else what else luke they have the same number of edges they have the same number of edges of corners corners m kay else they have the same number of vertices vertices which is another word for what
pictures girls your eyes should be looking at my 2 pictures vertices is the same thing as corners also they have the same number of faces which are going to be your flat surfaces do we have enough really to be able to talk about what our pattern is going to be see what could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month
audrey each heart could be an odd number but tell me what you think the picture is going to be solids alright the next thing we are going to do is we are going to play a game game the name of this game is going to be 120 spins
here and every day we are going to take the spinner chart who has a prediction about predictions yellow will mostly likely get the most tallies okay
yellow let me put this back up here so that you can see point if i see you with your whiteboard i will think that you are not with me here luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most
okay and i am just going to do a few predictions today because i want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of most going to need someone to help me with this okay
who has another prediction josh since you just jinxed it i think red will i think red will be the be the best since once you spin it and you probably spin it at the red or the blue it will probably go around and minute hey luke why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most
cause it has 2 squares yeah let us take a look at this folks say the yellow part is 2 fourths yeah we could say that 2 fourths of it is shaded no okay so we could say one half or 2 fourths are shaded yellow
4th so do you see where luke may have gotten that prediction in a spinner game he thinks that more than likely will land quite a bit there but josh says red will have the most because you guys just jinxed it
most okay make your predictions based on what you know about math and spinner games blue will have the most
too madison i think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins 0 good prediction said okay i said i was only going to take one more so put your hands down we got to move on blue plus red .
boy alright and do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner please i am going to take it to a hard surface bud alright what you are going to do is you are going to take it to a flat surface
spinner put it or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner count you will let me know how many yellows you had how many reds and how many blues okay
count and i think i am going to let laura do this spinner okay alright so watch watch whoever is closest to you you you guys remember how to make tallies 1234 and then you strike across
blinds he got yellow yellow sit down sit down brandon you can go get it out of your eyes blinds okay
yellows 1234 let me get someone else to help me blue okay yours 3 yellows okay so you are going to go strike across
232 reds 2 reds look right now we have 56789101112 we have done 12 spins
excited alright so we have 567 yellows
 okay i was going to say that red and blue for he predictions i was going to say that red and blue have the same amount red and blue will have here there is one more game that i want to teach you but we need to move on to what we are going to do in math today there is going to be another game where we are adding ounces each day
tomorrow if we add an ounce a day about how many ounces will we have tomorrow we will have about 3 we will have 3 ounces tomorrow okay please and when you back to your seats you are going to hold on to your whiteboards hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute i am going to see if you can kind of help me out on the number line and then we will put them away when we go to our partner game okay
you whoops thank you mister for letting me borrow that
you thank you alright get to a place where you can see please we are going to spend a couple minutes here together partners we will have to think about that for just a minute do we have everybody here today from both classes right
out okay so we have all 25 that means we will have to have one group of 3 lines i am actually going to put a 3rd one up there but we were kind of running out of room
ones alright what we are going to do is we are going to take a look at a decimal number and think about where it would go on 3 different number lines segment but i want you to show me where do you think you would put this number numbers on my number line
quick okay me 3 and 73 hundredths 3.733 and 73 hundredths looking at this why do not we just call this line number one looking at num .
10 what 2 numbers would that come between 3 and 4 and who thinks they can come and show me where it would come
come what we are going to work on today is refining the ability to compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line yours yes question if we were going to round this number .
4 and i was telling my my science class that i will not be here on monday because of jury duty but this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is rounding so i think it is kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today bit but 3.73 is closer to 4 line which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer is not it
alright now what i am going to do is i am going to erase this guy for just a minute and i am going to erase these numbers cause we are going to use this line we will call it number line 2 what is different about the 1st one that we just looked at david
it was going by ones and this one is going by 5s okay so this one is kind of going by halves me where would this number fall on this number line numbers because now you are not just looking at the whole number
you are having to look at parts of the decimal as well so show me what 2 numbers it would come in between
line where would it fall on this one so now you are having to compare .73 with another number she put it between 3.5 and 4 who agrees with that
ready i am going back up to the 1st one better what is different about this number line
 show me on your whiteboard where you think 3 and 73 hundredths would fall that because 3.7 and then you just need to go up 3 more and then you have it
kn he knew it was going to be bigger than 3.7 so he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this and i knew it was going to be less than 3.8 and he knew it was going to be less than this said he said in this case he had to look at the hundredths place if i wanted to round 3.73 boy we could just play with this number all day could not we
that yes 3.73 if i wanted to round this to the nearest whole number have we are just going to do a couple more things with this number
here so is it going to be closer it is it closer to 3 point 3 or 44 what is it closest to if it is right here okay can you round it to the closest 10th yes is it closer to 3.7 or 3.8 where would it fall 3.7 it would be the same thing as 3.7 i mean 3.70 well it would not be the same thing
round well right it would round to 3.7 okay and could you round it to the closest 100th what would that look like that that that would not really make any difference it would still be 3.73.70 alright we are going to play a partner game
kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day where we were using the decimal cards and you were and you were putting them in order game alright another fun partner game and let me show you how it works today you are going to have a recording sheet and you are going to have some more opportunities to compare numbers
kay goodness we have already been in class about 30 minutes alright what we are going to do is i am going to pass this around this is your recording sheet
baby can we put up our whiteboards wait hold on and we will do the whiteboards when we are going to get partners and transitioning okay the 1st thing that you are going to do is i want you to take a look at your recording sheet rounds david can you slide up sweetie you are going to play 5 rounds of this game
and i want you to be thinking is this game going to be more luck or strategy numbers it can be the one through 6 yourself where is the extra papers
extra extra read all about it
helpers you did not think to make things more efficient necessarily i make it more okay moment the 1st thing you are going to do is you are going to roll the dice you and your partner yet okay i roll i got a 3 she got a 3 so let us do this
you want to play class against miss courson for a couple of rounds 2 so who got less less so what i am going to do is how many circles are on my recording sheet
all the way down my paper i am going to go less than less than less than
game and you are going to you are going to be one person and i am going to be the other person me m kay alright so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who is going to go 1st again okay i got 3 she got 3
 the highest number wins or the lowest number wins by the way 1st just simply because i got to teach you the game anyway right so this is what .
thans now it really does not matter who rolls the dice 1st just whoever you star with you need to stick with times alright i got a 2 and watch what i am doing when i roll the dice i am putting it in the order .
okay so a strategy game would be i would have to maybe decide where to put it alright now roll the other 2 class 6 yes do not say yes yet works is that number sentence true
happen what whose paper is this a true sentence on aw okay so point because that made an accurate and true number sentence 2 and 26 hundredths is less that is why you all were like yeah and i was like 0 no see i knew i would beat you already
way so i want you to and if you take your paper home and your mom is like did your teacher tell you that was right it would be difficult to explain so i want you somewhere on your paper to write it the correct way
2 do you see what i mean by this is luck
okay you ready garett we are going left to right 4 times challenging 44 okay so we need 0
one what oops 22 yay we got a point is that a correct state yes do not forget to correct it on your paper wait it is already correct on our paper 0 that is right i need to correct it okay so we get a point okay you got a point i got a point
one okay so round 3 this is fun is not this a luck game it is a luck game it just depends .
of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than question i guess i want a turn okay you know what though i think i get to go fir i think actually it was my turn and then i will to you kay alright real easy to set up too
not if it is really close and you are not sure what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it moment on your whiteboard i want you to draw a picture of that number sentence use your flats your longs and your units
now 0 on the whiteboard we are supposed to draw the 3rd one what i am demonstrating right now is i am showing how if you needed more support and if you were not sure especially if you had something like one.20 and one.02 i do not get this at all
tenths and your hundredths okay no what i was recommending this for was if you got something like this and if it was tricky and if you needed the picture
game yes buddy what if they are equal well if they are 0 if they are equal hm you would have to probably redo it or a tie breaker or a tie breaker you could do that too okay when you go with your partner you are going to put your whiteboards away for me friends we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back okay
up you could take this page home board i am going to have you write in your math notebook and then we are going to share at the very end of class after this game partners just do not bump the camera
brandon joey who is your partner okay get started
minute do not forget what is the 1st step of this game
the 1st step is you have to roll the dice and decide who writes the less than symbol all the way down their paper and then that does not change and who writes the greater than down their paper and that does not change 1st figure out who is less than and greater than
dice you only needed one dice ladies so which one are y okay that is fine okay so laura you are less than all the way down
too alright and laura roll it again you are going to do the whole 1st .4 let us look at that okay so 2.24 is going to be less than something
than something that is going to be tricky who do you think is more than likely going to get this point based on the 1st 2 numbers
alright look at your number whose is correct laura is is because hers is actually less than 2 and 44 hundredths so who gets that point paper so that means hers it correct yours is not
okay 0 i like that a tally chart that works and and less than boys i am greater than okay
we are going to do the prompt on the board in just a minute in our math notebook you went really fast huh you want to play a couple more points you can play a couple more points so is this my number he is going to finish rolling all the way across
across it is just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence the other one will not be
okay and now he will do the next 4 rolls for the 3rd point
minutes you have a math notebook prompt on the board so you need to go to your next available page what is wrong bud
score you all both got one.14 and one.14
hers okay roll it again
okay so she rolled a 6311 and one of these is correct the other one is not
boom okay do not forget if yours was incorrect you have got to fix it on your paper so you do not take home the wrong information yes who is your partner fatima fatima is okay alright boys and girls as you come to a stopping point .
please boys friends on the floor aria board 3.7 or 3.653 point explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words you are going to do a quick write we are going to share these in about .
minutes so a quick write means you are sitting down you are getting it done home hurry away luke why do not you walk around and be the helper okay
back to your seat madison do you mind walking around pushing in chairs so we will be ready after lunch
container madison is already started
here i am also going to pass out your homework for tonight it is a review of what we have done
write i already see eunice she has her math notebook out which number is larger 3.7 or 3.65 explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words and also symbols and i will write your homework on the board
please the game sheet that you guys had today now and i think someone might be missing their math notebook because it has been up here on the table i think that is that is colby is i think it is
does everybody have a homework for tonight miss courson i do not get it larger 3 and 7 tenths or 3 and 65 hundredths explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words minutes keep writing pw i put ps nintey 6 because you see they have named it differently
book yeah that is why it says ps 96 not pw normally we put pw 960 it says ps on here too it says ps on the paper .
i like how i see kashish writ pictures maybe similar to what we did back before the game
madison the way i know 3.7 is greater than 3.65 is because if you added 0 to 770 is greater than 65 yes that is correct audrey 3.7 is farther on the number line so it is larger it is farther on the number line if we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class it would be down a tad would not it
 the 7 is maybe 700 yeah look at said he compared the tenths place and he knew that 7 was greater than what get 3 and 7 tenths is larger than 3 and 65 hundredths i know this because 10 times 10 is 100 so 7 times 10 is 70 and 70 is greater than 65 okay
josh i think 3 3.7 is bigger becau because it is the same thing as 3 3.70 okay saying 3 and 7th tenths is just another way of saying 3 and 70 hundredths that is why i think 3 and 7 tenths is greater than 3 and 65 hundredths did anyone draw a picture
pictures using x is or a 100s chart or dots
okay i did take one minute and share to the person to the right or to the left or across from you but turn to your elbow partner let them see your math thinking up tomorrow 2nd daily grade on this skill tomorrow cause i think we are good with it
share with aria cause i saw you having some great pictures there you could share with me too
nice friends we are also going to try to work on our bridges tomorrow kay the trucks to see if they can fit across i i do not see anything this has to be able to go across your bed and this has to be able to go under your bridge kay
i am shooting for our ceremony being on february 16th that is that thursday the bridge breaking ceremony under it has to fit because remember it has to be a certain amount of inches off the ground
100 okay so what makes this easier for us to compare percent okay kevin because what about the denominator they share the same denominator they share the same denominator right okay so this is 100s this is also okay in 100s and which one is larger now
this is very easy to compare right yes so this neighborhood had more people who said yes okay but if you just look at the numbers 31 17 it is very easy to say 0 yeah of course this is more 31 17 okay but in fact you have to look at the whole thing right everything okay
this so how do you turn this fraction into a percent or how do we turn these numbers you know 31 out of the total into a percent selina we divide the denominator by the numerator okay did we divide we did not divide yeah so what did we do
so as long as we can get a denominator to be equal to 100 and we have the equivalent fraction then we have the percent okay here here is another fraction what happened there we made an equivalent fraction right we made an equivalent fraction okay so how should we word this
okay like make equivalent fraction right and what about that equivalent fraction it has to have a numerator a denominator of .
and can you write this word down i do not know if you have heard of this okay this is called scale or scaling scale up scale down
it is like you know simplifying finding equivalent fraction okay so here the example would be okay we scaled 17 over 50 up to 34 over 100 sense okay why do you think we use the word scale
fall maps maps right remember those maps you made okay the large ones you scaled them down to smaller versions right so that is kind of scaling and when you scale what happens
one to 2 we can scale it up to how can we make a percent percent 10 over 20 does that help us make the percent 100 okay we want a numerator denominator of 100 right
okay now we scale this up to 50 over 100 but if you look at the relationship this is a one to 2 this is half of that right that yes they are still the same they are still equal okay right so kind of get used to this word okay scale up scale down okay
mean let me give you an example okay so 15 over 18 okay maybe divide it by 6
okay so this is scaling down right it is like simplifying okay and sometimes actually this is not a good example we will look at it in a few minutes
so scale down and then scale up okay okay sometimes you will have to do that you simplify it and then you will be able to find the 100 okay as the denominator in this case okay it does not work and we will come back to this okay so we will talk about that
and what is the total what is the 100% what number for yao ming 7474 no what is the number
301 301 okay and how many did shaquille make 451451 so by just looking at the numbers can we say 0 of course shaquille 0 neal is a better is better at free throw no
yes and this is out of 771 and you said that the gap you mean the difference between these 2 okay it is bigger than this okay all right do you agree or disagree so when we look at these numbers we can not just say 0 451 is more you know but we have to look at the total right the total okay
so what are some strategies for estimating what are some strategies we want to find out the the percent right so what are some strategies yes how about using a benchmark number how about using landmark or benchmark numbers right okay so how do you what what is a good number to to round to 300 is this close to 300
yes and we say well let us try 300 okay out of now remember we have to find numbers that are easy to work with okay not just numbers that are very close 400 okay so what is a what is a good number to use
350 how about 350 let us try 350 okay now 300 out of 350 okay so what can we divide this into okay lawrence we divide it into sevenths okay does that work sevenths yes so 123456 sevenths okay and where would the 300 be
6 sevenths well if we divide this into 3 sevenths the 1st one would be 5050 right okay 12 350 200 300 300 okay and this is 350 so it would be somewhere over here right yes okay so let us put a star here okay what about this number
use i said 720 because it is a multiple of a number 720 is a multiple of a number what number a multiple of 56
one we want the same multiple right we want to be able to find you know to to scale it down or up
9 yes 5 so does that mean we can do 9s yes 0 yeah okay i am not very good at 9s but 0 that does not work so what what is what are some strategies remember we talked about making 9s by the thirds thirds very good
then into thirds again right yes okay so where is 7 where is 720 it would be right here what about 450 if these are 9s you divide 720 by 9 so each one is
505090908080 right 8 times 9 is 7 72
be number 44 right there 40480 right in the middle of the 480 right in the middle of the 100 around here okay all right let us get the rest of these so what is the next one
56560 and 450 between 400 and 40 and 180 140 all right okay so it is closer right it is closer to 100
okay so i i think these are very close estimates and can we tell by just looking at the 2 lines that yao ming is actually closer to 100% than shaquille 0 neal okay so there is another strategy you make a fraction bar or a percent bar okay now what about the let us see
strategies you say i am not going to do rounding maybe i will do halves i will do use benchmark fractions does that work so let us say this is yao this is yao ming is 371 shaquille is 725 can we use some benchmarks so here says what would be 50%
50% that is half and what number would that be 118518185180 is that about 185 yes okay and what about here 36360 about 362
2 okay 365 all right so how does this help now we know half way is about 150 185 and then that is about 360
help can that help us figure out you know where each person was no what are we trying to find we are trying to find a spot for that number right where does 301 belong on this line
us no well can we at least say that it is on this side or it is on this side right and how about shaquille it is also on the right
okay so now let us do fourths now what would be half half of that
so 184 okay another 4292 to that right 272270 272
and here 5454340 wow okay now can does this help 301 half and a half it would be between 272 and 371 right yes
451 in between yeah it would be between these 2 between one half and 3 fourths so so does this help us yes yes okay yes i was exact right okay so if you use benchmark numbers you should be able to okay
let us say if this does not work then we can break it down into even smaller parts right but this strategy works okay so we use a fraction the percent bar okay let us let us take a look at that that last one and i think that is a very good question
disagree okay this person alicia said yao ming made 301 free throws and shaquille 0 neal made 451
so shaquille 0 neal has the better record okay agree disagree okay raise your hand marlene i disagree because shaquille 0 neal had an elbow but not shaquille so so you disagree that means what does that mean
record yes okay does anyone disagree with marlene is statement and that means you agree with alicia is in other words can we say that shaquille actually has the better record
no so you all agree with marlene yes okay but what is the difference if you look at these 2 numbers just the ones in purple not the denominator just the what are these numbers these are the free throws that they made right so he made yao ming made that many shaquille 0 neal made that many
is it possible to argue that he is better he has a better record yes because you it depends because you do not know the denominator okay all right because you do not know the denominator because well we do know do not we
we do know okay yes but it you know we do know the denominator so yes i just i recognize this right now but like you could say that yao ming has more because if you -3 72 301 then you only have like only like 70 left like any missed and then if you -125 or 451 you will have a lot more than okay how many 200
2 hundered and 76 okay so you are saying that shaquille missed many more shots than yao ming so he is better right yeah in terms of okay
okay the lower the denominator then the cole the denominator yeah and the numerator 0 and the numerator the higher the percentage it is lower so how about fraction like 13rd
it has to be of course the numerator to the denominator okay so can we say that when the numerator is very close to the denominator that the percentage is higher yes okay okay i think that is a very good point okay so what i would like you to think about now is the other strategies that you wrote down
okay the 2nd and the 3rd okay so this is one strategy right
we actually did we write that down estimate rounding okay maybe we can write this down too okay so this is not finding the exact percentage but we can estimate right
what yes by rounding and using benchmark numbers yes
okay all right so this is a strategy for estimating not finding the exact okay so let us think about what .
let us see okay so i will i will transfer this over okay you all set with this
use fraction or percent bars right okay what happens when you have .
any any of these strategies okay let us say there is a fraction but you can not round the 100 you cannot scale up or down you know to get to 100 and and then you cannot estimate because you want the exact answer okay then what do you do
let me give you a simple example how about one out of 3 can we scale this up or down to make this 100 into 100
yes okay how does this work boys and girls no we can have 26s 39s one over 30 but how do we get to a 100 we can not not .
example now what happens when you need to make a percent then you you can not estimate then it is that is a problem okay
so when you have the decimal and then what how do you make it into a percent you turn it into a .
percent okay and we will we will practice okay did you write this down okay so when you cannot do any of the other use any of the other strategies you use this one okay and and it always works okay with this one
you divide a numerator by the denominator okay then you look at this let us look at the same example they are all one over 3 okay so it is 3 divided by one so it is 33% no it is 33 well one out of 3 how can that be 3% right that does not make sense because you do 3 divided by one are we dividing 3 by one no
okay i know it does not look very it does not look right but we remember this when we did this when you write the fraction this way dylan yeah one divided one over 3 and what does this symbol mean divide on the keyboard the computer keyboard that means divide right so when you write you can write it like this
so this is the same as that same as that right yes or no
yes so how do you divide one by 30 and i think we did this okay put a 0 put a 0 so this is one and 0 tenths 3 goes into 10th that how many times
no so this is 110th if we do the standard way then what happens after a while you notice that it repeats right okay so whenever it repeats then you do not have to go on because it will not stop okay and we put the little line okay above this and that means it repeats okay so 13rd is the same as 0.30.3 with that bar notation okay at the top
now that is only a decimal so how do we turn the decimal into a percent we move the decimal if you do not put you move 2 spaces back which is it is 0.33 that is 33 but since it is only .3 you put 13rd into it
instead of writing the decimal especially when it repeats we made we did not use the remainder right what happened marlene so we turned that into a fraction a fraction okay now this repeats so this is a remainder
do you put the 13rd at the top here right and 3rd so this decimal is and is it should we do 0.3 and a 3rd no or 3333 okay 33 because we as jackie said you have to move the decimal point how many spaces 2
right okay so that means over okay so this is the exact decimal right
that is not estimating that is not rounding and you turn it into a percent 33 okay and of course you think about it does it make sense
13rd is that about 33% 333333 that is about a 100 right okay all right so let me have you practice
okay take a look at the next page and remember sometimes okay you have to scale up scale down and if it does not work then you use this last strategy okay
christina 13 out of 16 so which player should the coach select to make the free throw attempt and explain your reasoning okay so i want you to do this in your notebook i want you to figure out you know each one and maybe what is the strategy how do we i mean can we just look at these numbers and say 0 this is the best person in free throw so what do you do
because 150 probably 15 equals 4 and to get one a denominator of 100 you have to multiply by 20 so when you multiply something by 20 does it get 20 times as much no it stays the same because we are scaling up okay i see what you are doing but if you write it like this that means you multiply this by 20
that means you make this 20 times more so what is the what is the right way to write that you multiply this by 20 and you multiply this by 20 also like a numerator and how is that different 20 versus 20 over 20 because that shows that you are multiplying each one by 20
if you do that you are just multiplying that whole thing 20 times 20 times right okay why do you think christina is the best at free throw yeah because they are both the same because the quickest way to do it that i found out was 3 +3 equals 16
way if you use if 13 goes into 16 even if these 2 have 3 she had more time to go for free throws than 13
so she got 13 out of 16 and it would be a little it would just be a little bit the percentage would just be a little bit more than this because this has a more because she had more time and then she had 13
okay they had different right that is very good thinking but if you look at the the numbers of attempts okay they all did different they they they used different numbers right yes
yes so can you turn that into a 100 is that 12 out of 15 maybe you can write it down and yeah put it on this page so we can see 1515 can you turn 15 12 over 15 into something over 100
no no right so that 1st strategy okay that does not work can we try the try the other one try to scale it up up if you scale it up it would be 24 over 30
100 try to scale it down and see if that works so do 12 over 15 equal so scale it down that means simplify it right okay are you trying to use a percent bar yeah that is okay because 15 goes into 106 times is it exactly 6 times no
okay but we want exact numbers is there another way to remember the strategies that we talked about like 15 to 10 and then yeah can you try to scale it up scale it down yeah sometimes you will have to go down before you can go up
see that good because 5 times 20 equals yes 60 okay now why is that a 3 because 12 times 4 okay and a 3 times 4 equals 12
so what do you mean tell me more what do you mean common factor is that emily 15 out of 20 see can you do a fraction line a fraction bar
so you see a fraction in other words you turn that into a fraction does that work little boy i did 20 out of 15 out of 15 i made this 20 because if it is rounded down it will be 10
200 and now now we can not round okay not we need the exact number right okay so when you round you estimate so we are not estimating can you write that fraction here 12 over 15
equal and we are trying to find a fraction that has a 100 at the bottom right it is not a factor of a 100 it is good so then so let us try those strategies how about the 2nd one
by scaling can you scale down scale down that means make these 2 numbers smaller but yet they still equal the same okay
okay do you think that works yeah that exactly and what percent is that
80% so this is a case when you have to round that not round but scale them before you can get to 100 right that is good so so angela that is 80% okay can you explain this to me
20 so these are common factors they both have 5 good so 15 times 5 equals 75 so i turn it into a fraction 20 times 5 equals 100 so i turn this into a fraction okay and then 75 out of 100 that is 75
good are you trying to use the same way to find emily or are you using a different strategy okay i am using a all right remember i used the i did it
see so this one is both and this one is okay what do you mean both
me because 15 out of i put equal because if i round it all up to the 20 so i put 15 +5 will equal 20 so i put 12 +5 now why did you round up
when do we round remember when we do you need this i am all set you okay i am going to recycle that okay thanks ms fong so why do you why why do you need to round we are not rounding are we when are we estimating here so this is not estimating okay
so you can not round but can can you write it as a fraction ms
okay so 12 out of 15 make a fraction it is not the same 12 over 15 good it is 2 away and can you use any of those strategies scaling up and down turning the denominator into a 100 did that work can you tell me what you did
one divide the numerator okay
does that mean i am better than christina no no
you need to find the 8 out of 1010 exact percent 18 out of 10 attempts can you go back and yep
so angela is a 12 out of 15
you that you do not estimate okay we are not estimating so you need the exact fraction percent okay where is the 1st one
75 okay and how did you know because i changed it into a fraction which is 3 fourths right so what is re this is 3 fourths how did you make that into a 34th i i scaled it to 6
6 over i believe 8 all right now 6 that is half of that right is 8 half of that
to but i think you have the you have the right idea lewis so can you scale it differently okay maybe you can just write the fraction here and try to reduce it try to scale it okay can you scale it down yes or simplify simplify it down to 6
okay okay does that work that is half of that and i do not think so 15 is that an even number no
no so we can not do that try another number you can do let us see 4 okay okay divided by 3 good so that is worth this
yes how do you go from here to the percent how accurate are these parts is this exactly the same as that
how about using some numbers this is a good strategy okay
now since these are so close can you try to use some numbers to figure out okay boys and girls we have a couple more minutes let me have your attention okay just for a minute up here
all right we let us look at the problem okay so for angela okay since we are not estimating okay i need you to find the exact number okay so what is the what is the fraction there kevin all right and you want to find a remember those strategies
can we find a fraction that has a 100 yes okay so if 15 does 15 go into 100 evenly no okay if not then we will have to use another strategy right down so we can scale this down listening please simon scale it down to .
okay does that work divided by 3 divided by 3 and then can you scale it up 5 can go into 100 right okay and now we have a fraction eyes up here alphonsus okay now for the other 2 people you need to do the same thing
so emily and christina what do you notice about the last one
yeah yeah the sooner we get math done the sooner we get through everything else the more chance that free time starts at 2.35 time free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45 see it means you get extra free time that is a good thing all right shhh is it looking at you right now on we are going to try to pretend it is not here please counting down from 5 4 3 2
you shush you shush too i am going to pick 5 prize winners today and they are going to get to pick from the prize box and the 1st person i pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box so it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can
say yes jamari did not i get picked out yes you can pick later for that too jamari okay so let us get started so that we can get to work on all right somebody want to read our objective for today i do
josea what is our objective for today students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly polygon okay stop there jamari to do okay something else to learn maybe to .
to learn okay answer no and you need to not call out what does det lala determine mean to know the word of what it is
decide to figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon right anyone know what a polygon is me because i want to know that you knew and you will get extra points for that
you know where they are
you can write it down now what we are going to start with is i want you to see is listen listen i know what a polygon looks like this is one minute off of free time shut up
man i i understand that it is different having a video camera in here but
go now again guys this is a video camera no big deal okay what we usually do not act like that since when we are doing math when the camera is not here
no well well that is what i am saying this is not how we normally act during math so let us try to make it normal pretend it is not even here okay okay now we are going to talk about no
not i will wait no one is even talking you know what guys i will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether if somebody is talking and is not supposed to i will take care of that no
on i just want you to look at this for a 2nd 0 this did not get turned on please do not whistle so sorry but there is a camera okay and again camera should not make any difference done no
red okay so let us wait and see if it comes on or not okay freeze it is coming on okay hit the 1st 2 lights please no it is not yes it is
how do you know okay you guys are right again wait a 2nd yeah just 2 just half you no so boring you know what okay sorry sorry you are not going to be famous okay
all right until i get this on let us take a look at the paper in front of you
so what i want you to do while i get this fixed is i want you to look and try to figure out head what is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons in your head only that is not a polygon no in your head only polygon no i am right now i can not spell right now
ms jensen maybe the plug is not working the kind of plug 0 you know what 0 wait the thing is not on xavier you get 10000 points that might be the problem not what hey he did not do that because he saw the plug unplugged all right everybody stand up
mom i will take care of it do not worry about it
okay now everybody look at the camera make a funny face seat okay now sit down okay okay come on now sit down now we need to forget that it is even there okay now i will wait
do okay maybe the battery maybe it is the plug up up there hold on a 2nd yes can we pause this only because i am having major technical difficulties with my board and .
so the kids are all silly anyway we could turn it back on in a 2nd i just okay let us fix so someone let us start and somebody read our content objective again me
again students can students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon polygon or not a polygon okay so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon okay
and we just said that we that determine means to figure out or decide so we are going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or is not a polygon okay now someone read the language objective xavier students 0 wait students will be able to define a polygon students will be able to define a polygon
okay so not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or is not a polygon but before you can do that you have to know what a polygon is right i have heard of it before you have heard of it before anybody else heard of it before nope no okay well we are going to talk about them today the paper in front of you and up here has 3 shapes that they are telling us are polygons okay and the bottom 5 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so the 1st thing i want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons what might be the same about them it because i am going to give you another sheet in a minute and you are going to work with .
you to try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons okay
so do you understand what i said richard yeah repeat what i said for me please repeat what i said you are going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons okay and you are going to work with a partner to do so so take a look at these again and notice what they have in common
those top 3 notice what they have in common comments i want to see how you guys do working this out on your own with your partner and and the bottom ones you are going to figure out why are they not polygons what is different from the ones on top okay so i am going to have richard nathan and jamari work together as a trio
i will take care of you in a 2nd xavier xavier you are going to work with josea and what you are going to do is if you think this shape is a polygon you are going to write a p on it if you think this shape is not a polygon you are going to write an n on it for not too nope because that already tells you
they already tell you there that is your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon isaiah and justin together please miguel and thomas together please marvin and isaiah together please you know what we work with partners as we are assigned in this class and you get rewarded when you work with no he is not you are not going to start trouble are you what am i doing you are working with marvin okay umm
me marvin work with isaiah please okay you know what isaiah can you bring your seat over here and work with no you are working by yourself if you do not work with him
did you hear what i said hey do you know what you are doing what is the matter what is the matter can you work with thomas at least or you do not want to work with thomas ms
out nope you write p if it is a polygon you write n if it is not a polygon all right n
well did you talk to your partner did you decide what makes a polygon and what does not yeah all right if it is a polygon are you guys talking to each other what makes a polygon what does not make a polygon i think a polygon is fully shaped fully shaped okay this is not a polygon okay well talk to your partners about that tell them i do not want you to just write something down i want you to talk about it
yeah that every one of them is the same he is not even done how could it be the same you guys need to talk to him
it we are going to do a little activity with this in a 2nd no it does not matter but does look it like it
yes i got my name so small okay that is fine make sure you and xavier have the same answers and i am going to tell you in a minute no worries if it is polygon you put the one okay that is a polygon i am asking you
it is not there no it does not that is just that is cool right it says polygon and then it says not a polygon you it means we are going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that are not that is so easy that is my name right here okay to your seat
okay i was getting ready for our next step xavier your seat is over here please be in it xavier not in 5 minutes right now but they are doing them wrong xavier listen to me
okay now the reason are you guys done isaiah and justin have you finished no okay hurry up and finish you got 30 more seconds or actually bring it back to your seats where you were that is fine after i want to talk about the next step
you i confused some of you and rightfully so because what i did was i drew 2 circles on the board and i put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other but what this means is we are going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet and the ones that are a polygon we are going to put inside this circle and the ones that are not a polygon we are going to put inside that circle
so i am not telling you this is a polygon this is not a polygon so that is why you were confused and it is good to be confused it means you were paying attention okay attention no it does not yes it does i will wait 3
one xavier xavier yeah please put that down now what do you want to tell me then because i am going to give this marker out for a 2nd and i am going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that is on your paper and put it in the right circle
so for example you could choose number one and if you think it is a polygon draw it in the polygon circle if you think it is not a polygon draw it in the not a polygon circle the one thing i am going to say is let us draw them about this size so that we have enough room okay
room we want them big enough so everyone can see them you can tell me in 12nd so miguel not right this 2nd who would like to put a polygon or not a polygon up there yes not i want to
way let us make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that so jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon thank you okay so jamari says this is a polygon okay if you disagree with him when it is your turn you can put a question mark inside his polygon
if you say nah that is not a polygon that is not a polygon then you could come up okay but you could come up and you could put a question mark inside
no your excitement all right so richard draw us a polygon or not a polygon i am not even doing nothing do you know what you are yes i know josea you have had how many good days in a row no so make some good choices for me okay yes yes can i go next possibly hold on
all right so richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite right
i would josea you had a chance right but everybody is going to get a chance 1st what is that
here turn this over it is a square i need you looking at this it this a square or is it not now that is perfect and they are not going to look exactly like they look in the picture what you can do
umm where is that marker please wait why did you give him the marker what number was yours josea mine it 9 what number is yours jamari mine is one
we will put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape 2 no that one is 2 that one is 2
okay that way we are all talking about the same shape okay isaiah would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon in your opinion or one that is not a polygon not okay go ahead not is over here do i have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon
justin put the number up there too okay so you are saying that is a polygon okay what number is it
number 8 we are discussing the paper what number is that on do you have one that is not a polygon i do
that is not a polygon i got one right yeah no i do not know which one have not you done one already let us let everyone have a chance 1st do you have one that is not a polygon ms on does anybody else wants wants a turn that has not had a turn i do i do i do i do
you just did one right nathan you want a turn do you have one that is not a polygon uhh no do you have one that is a polygon okay can i do it
yeah thank you not a polygon please yeah it belongs in there please no he messed up he did something wrong he has got the extra okay well copy it right off the paper he has the paper in front of him he can fix it
that looks like a state or something on the map it looks nothing like mpas where does it come out
that you forgot to write the number you are not showing no no no because all right let us take a look at
yes all right go put it up quick the the marker is already up there do about someone is up there thatt hey think ah i do not agree i do not agree i either think this is a polygon or i think it is not a polygon i think they got it mixed up think 3 of them okay
go put the question marks in them put that away now
why because it is not time to draw it is time to do math
why you know the rules richard you know the rules the same rules every day on do you have more that go up there or do you have a question about one
all right the way we are going to start xavier huh the right but right now i need you up here please okay thank you i appreciate that you are talking about math but right now we are going to have a whole group discussion about math okay
there i want your 1st thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not i want your 1st thoughts about polygons okay is there something that you notice about those 1st 3 polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have
yes that the ones the 31s on the top are like regular shapes like square a star so you are saying that they are regular shapes okay
all right well are not these regular shapes here too though yeah okay anybody have anything else that when they 1st look at these they think hey i know what these polygons might have in common i know one
so what richard is saying is that this is not together okay whereas this is together all of the line segments meet okay now richard when we talk about that in math when we talk about a shape like this that does not meet and a shape like this that does meet .
we are talking about a closed shape or an open shape okay now a closed shape all the line segments and it is hard sometimes with this but it is difficult sometimes with the pen but .
miguel i can take care of it myself thank you now an open shape could look something like this right difference this part of it is left open this it is all closed
say that polygons richard is theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes richard are they open or closed
closed closed i do not know why that is coming out red but so you know what
color we are looking for characteristics of polygons in math when we are talking about characteristics we are talking about attributes if i was talking about jamari one of the characteristics i could use to describe him is that he is kind and he is gentle
all right he is a good friend those are characteristics that would describe jamari right what we are doing now is we are coming up with characteristics that describe polygons okay another word for characteristics is attributes so what attributes do polygons have okay how would we describe polygons i could describe jamari as tall kind gentle right how would i describe a polygon
one way we are thinking to describe a polygon is that it is a closed wait a 2nd 12nd that it is closed okay figure okay and we know that that means all the even okay this needs to be recalibrated but
closed i did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot i did not give up i am just going to recalibrate it after math is over then we will be able to do it now so do you see how all 4 sides meet yeah that makes it a closed figure so a polygon is a closed figure
can you give me something else that is an attribute you think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons miguel the sides have to meet the sides have to meet miguel says what do you mean by that everything meets like in the corner ms
jensen sides meet at corners ms
jensen okay saying that excuse me now saying sides meet at corners miguel is different from lines of symmetry okay saying that sides meet at corners here we have sides meeting at corners right
here we have sides meeting at corners one corner 2345 corners right okay but that is different from lines of symmetry on 1st look there would not be any lines of symmetry to this figure okay so that is okay it is good thinking and this is actually you are on the right track here okay but i do not want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it does not really have to do with that okay
yes sides meet at corners okay some yeah okay so if we are not saying all and we are saying some do you think it has to mean the lines do the shape are like even
like this this is a polygon right this has the same height of this and then this okay so you are showing me so you are showing me on this paper here you are saying that this one has equal sides right yeah
no but they are telling us this is a polygon so this might have equal sides but it does not seem like you have to have equal sides does it no so that is something that some polygons might have but we are looking for things that all polygons are going to have
okay good thinking though nathan uhh pointy they all have points okay so you are saying it begins with an a
no problem you are saying she has been up for a minute because rocky needed the bathroom but she wants me to brush her hair do you have our spray right up there okay so these polygons here umm what was the question repeat repeat what you said nathan 0 they all have points okay what do we call this when we are talking about math do the corners corners okay
we are getting some great math vocabulary words here sides corners does anyone know and i used this word before this might be a new one for you what it is called when we have a straight line the part of a straight line
what we call that line segment line segment all right so we can say about polygons that they have sides right what line segments all the polygons have lines right
right so they all have line segments so sides are line segments now let us get back to what nathan said
right so we know that they have sides that are line segments that they meet at the corners okay anyone know the math term for when 2 line segments meet like that to form an angle
it right angle vertical they are called vertices okay where 2 line segments meet and make angle are called vertices okay
here you know miguel i am glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes lie now now you have to walk all the way over there that is okay that is okay i can handle it now so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure the sides meet at corners okay
and that the sides are line segments okay that is a good list that is a very good list can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that 1st page here sorry have that in common can we agree that they have corners yes
all right let us look at not jamari is very excited that he was right now let us hold on now not polygons let us think of our list all right closed figure open open figure they are always open
no no corners no corners meet okay so let us look at this if we have as our 3 characteristics i am going to write inside of this okay because this is polygons we have closed line segments vertices and vertices and i am abbreviating okay
we know it means that they all have line segments as their sides that those line segments meet i got one in the corners which are vertices and that it is a closed shape hold on
this big line segment here right that is extending out from this vertice okay so we know this is not a polygon what is wrong with this closed it has a line segment this vertice but not really right because what cut in half but not really because what
no yeah no a line segment is straight okay a line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this this is what this is if it is not straight it is circle not a circle oval it is not an oval but what is the what is the .
the line here is not straight so it is not a line segment it is curved right polygon what about this it is crooked it is crooked it is crooked it is not that it is crooked because this is a straight line one side is bigger than the other this is a straight line one is bigger than the other okay
on i want to go back to our 3 attributes that we came up with so far closed line segments and vertices does it have corners where it meets yes is it a closed figure not really no closed well yes let me let me take that back because we missed and this is my bad
we missed part of line segments the thing about polygons my fault is that the thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices but they do not cross
cross okay so they never cross that is the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon okay those line segments never cross
job great job let us go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see yes yep consensus is this a polygon yes yes is this a polygon yes is this a polygon no you it is curved they are not line segments right
so no closed yes does it have straight lines that do not cross
does it have straight lines that do not cross yeah does the do they meet at vertices do they all meet at corners yeah is it a polygon no is because i look kind of crooked it no these are in order you are getting confused in order for a line to be straight it does not mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way
it can be any way it just can not be curved okay closed yes is are they line segments that do not cross yes are they do they have vertices yeah is it a polygon yes yes let us go to
let us go to not a polygon is this not a polygon yeah correct how about this one why is it not a polygon it is a polygon because it has straight lines it has straight lines what else and it has line segments okay it has line segments that do not cross
it has corners and it is closed this is a polygon so who put the question mark up here jamari jamari did you you were right jamari that is well i should not put a correct mark because this is a polygon okay
one number 10 here isaiah you put this one up right not a polygon tell me you think it is not a polygon tell me why you think it is not a polygon isaiah because it does not have the the even sides it is curved right this is not a polygon right it is not a polygon what is wrong with this one
that has crooked like the lines okay take crooked take crooked out of your vocabulary right right it is not a polygon okay number 12 that is not a polygon i want to take a look at that 12 why is it not a polygon because it it is not even
even one of the sides is shorter than the other side did we say that the sides have to be equal over here no we have we said that the sides have to be line segments that do not cross are there any line segments that cross in that yeah where no no no no is it a closed figure or an open figure i was right on that one too closed yes you were
figure closed do they meet at corners do the line segments meet at corners is this a polygon yes this is a polygon you know what
much this is turned on too right yesterday so we are going to add 2 days starting with to our number line
school and today is the 110th day of school how many days until the end of the school year
baby the 1st thing you are going to do is write a fraction showing how many days we have been in school so far and we are going to spend just about 10 minutes doing calendar we may not get to everything show me the fraction that tells us how many days we have been in school so far
2 while we are doing this do any of our numbers need part
10 how many more circles will i have before the end of this school year
anything 110 had 2 factors anybody i think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms was i see a lot of equivalent fractions
go 11 over 1811 over 18 that was pretty interesting ha so we could say we have had 11 eighteenths of our school year already that is pretty what fraction tells us how much to go
do reduce it remember i see a lot of 35 over 90 so what i want you to do is to look both at 35 and at nintey see if it can be .
year that is what i got too 7 eighteenths and 11 eigteenths those were the 2 numbers them using a less than greater than or equal to symbol compare the fraction that is showing the days we have already done the days we have left m kay good deal alright let us take a look at a couple new things i want to show you
the 1st thing i want us to do is we are going to add days and i wonder if you see it we can create an equivalent decimal
10 colored another 10 number what about using a decimal one and 10 hundredths we also have one one which is one and 110th
can you show me the percent what would the percent be
here and i have some new pictures when is my next birthday in february
tomorrow but let us take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month 1st we are going to do it for yesterday and for today
turn to your elbow partner and tell them something about a cube yet valentine is day it is a smile and a heart maybe it is part of the pattern it is
it is going to be related to the pattern but we have not seen enough yet
can what other shape can boxes be made into box a rectangle rectangular prism
raised quadrilateral huh quadrilateral well they are not quadrilaterals but they are faces maybe dimensional so how many faces are there 6 think of a dice or a box how many sides are there
else what else luke they have the same number of edges they have the same number of edges of corners corners m kay else they have the same number of vertices vertices which is another word for what
pictures girls your eyes should be looking at my 2 pictures vertices is the same thing as corners also they have the same number of faces which are going to be your flat surfaces do we have enough really to be able to talk about what our pattern is going to be see what could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month
audrey each heart could be an odd number but tell me what you think the picture is going to be solids alright the next thing we are going to do is we are going to play a game that number crunch went away for a little bit we are going to play a probability game spins and what we are going to do is i have 2 spinners up here
and every day we are going to take the spinner chart who has a prediction about predictions yellow will mostly likely get the most tallies okay
yellow let me put this back up here so that you can see point if i see you with your whiteboard i will think that you are not with me here luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most
okay and i am just going to do a few predictions today because i want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of most going to need someone to help me with this okay who has another prediction
josh since you just jinxed it i think red will i think red will be the be the best since once you spin it and you probably spin it at the red or the blue it will probably go around and minute hey luke why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most
cause it has 2 squares yeah let us take a look at this folks say the yellow part is 2 fourths yeah we could say that 2 fourths of it is shaded no okay so we could say one half or 2 fourths are shaded yellow
4th so do you see where luke may have gotten that prediction in a spinner game he thinks that more than likely will land quite a bit there but josh says red will have the most because you guys just jinxed it
most okay make your predictions based on what you know about math and spinner games blue will have the most
too madison i think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins 0 good prediction said okay i said i was only going to take one more so put your hands down we got to move on blue plus red .
boy alright and do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner please i am going to take it to a hard surface bud alright what you are going to do is you are going to take it to a flat surface
spinner put it or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner count you will let me know how many yellows you had how many reds and how many blues okay
count and i think i am going to let laura do this spinner okay you you guys remember how to make tallies 1234 and then you strike across
blinds he got yellow yellow sit down sit down brandon you can go get it out of your eyes blinds okay
yellows 1234 let me get someone else to help me blue okay yours 3 yellows okay so you are going to go strike across
232 reds 2 reds look right now we have 56789101112 we have done 12 spins
excited alright so we have 567 yellows
okay i was going to say that red and blue for he predictions i was going to say that red and blue have the same amount red and blue will have here there is one more game that i want to teach you but we need to move on to what we are going to do in math today there is going to be another game where we are adding ounces each day
tomorrow if we add an ounce a day about how many ounces will we have tomorrow we will have about 3 we will have 3 ounces tomorrow okay so we will talk a little bit about that please and when you back to your seats you are going to hold on to your whiteboards hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute i am going to see if you can kind of help me out on the number line and then we will put them away when we go to our partner game okay
you whoops thank you mister for letting me borrow that sweetie i am going to slide behind you
thank you alright get to a place where you can see please we are going to spend a couple minutes here together partners we will have to think about that for just a minute do we have everybody here today from both classes right
out okay so we have all 25 that means we will have to have one group of 3 lines i am actually going to put a 3rd one up there but we were kind of running out of room
ones alright what we are going to do is we are going to take a look at a decimal number and think about where it would go on 3 different number lines segment but i want you to show me where do you think you would put this number numbers on my number line
1st of all let me erase this real quick okay me 3 and 73 hundredths 3.733 and 73 hundredths looking at this why do not we just call this line number one looking at num 10 what 2 numbers would that come between
3 and 4 and who thinks they can come and show me where it would come come what we are going to work on today is refining the ability to compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line
yours yes question if we were going to round this number 4 and i was telling my my science class that i will not be here on monday because of jury duty but this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is rounding so i think it is kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today
bit but 3.73 is closer to 4 line which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer is not it alright now what i am going to do is i am going to erase this guy for just a minute and i am going to erase these numbers cause we are going to use this look at the 2nd number line we will call it number line 2 what is different about the 1st one that we just looked at david
it was going by ones and this one is going by 5s okay so this one is kind of going by halves me where would this number fall on this number line
numbers because now you are not just looking at the whole number well so show me what 2 numbers it would come in between
line where would it fall on this one so now you are having to compare .73 with another number she put it between 3.5 and 4 who agrees with that
ready i am going back up to the 1st one better what is different about this number line
 show me on your whiteboard where you think 3 and 73 hundredths would fall that because 3.7 and then you just need to go up 3 more and then you have it
kn he knew it was going to be bigger than 3.7 so he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this and i knew it was going to be less than 3.8 and he knew it was going to be less than this said he said in this case he had to look at the hundredths place if i wanted to round 3.73 boy we could just play with this number all day could not we
that yes 3.73 if i wanted to round this to the nearest whole number have we are just going to do a couple more things with this number
that means you are going to have .00.00 you are rounding it to the nearest whole number here so is it going to be closer it is it closer to 3 point 3 or 44 what is it closest to if it is right here 4 okay can you round it to the closest 10th
yes is it closer to 3.7 or 3.8 where would it fall 3.7 it would be the same thing as 3.7 i mean 3.70 well it would not be the same thing round well right it would round to 3.7 okay and could you round it to the closest 100th what would that look like
 that that that would not really make any difference it would still be 3.73.70 alright we are going to play a partner game kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day where we were using the decimal cards and you were and you were putting them in order game alright another fun partner game and let me show you how it works today
you are going to have a recording sheet and you are going to have numbers and to use your great than less than and equal to symbols kay
i had to get you one that was more challenging to be able to play
transitioning okay the 1st thing that you are going to do is i want you to take a look at your recording sheet rounds david can you slide up sweetie you are going to play 5 rounds of this game
and i want you to be thinking is this game going to be more luck or strategy numbers it can be the one through 6 yourself where is the extra papers
helpers you did not think to make things more efficient necessarily i make it more okay
yet okay i roll i got a 3 she got a 3 so let us do this you want to play class against miss courson for a couple of rounds 2 so who got less less so what i am going to do is how many circles are on my recording sheet
all the way down my paper i am going to go less than less than less than huh 4 times i ran out of board
game and you are going to you are going to be one person and i am going to be the other person me m kay alright so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who is going to go 1st again okay i got 3 she got 3
 the highest number wins or the lowest number wins by the way 1st just simply because i got to teach you the game anyway right so this is what huh did you cheat watch alright let us listen go ahead and write this all the way down your paper as well
thans now it really does not matter who rolls the dice 1st just whoever you star with you need to stick with times alright i got a 2 and watch what i am doing when i roll the dice i am putting it in the order .
okay so a strategy game would be i would have to maybe decide where to put it alright now roll the other 2 class 6 yes do not say yes yet works is that number sentence true
happen what whose paper is this a true sentence on aw okay so point because that made an accurate and true number sentence 2 and 26 hundredths is less that is why you all were like yeah and i was like 0 no see i knew i would beat you already
way so i want you to and if you take your paper home and your mom is like did your teacher tell you that was right it would be difficult to explain so i want you somewhere on your paper to write it the correct way
alright the next one looks like this 2 do you see what i mean by this is luck
garett we are going left to right 4 times challenging 44 okay so we need 01 what oops 22 yay we got a point is that a correct state .
yes do not forget to correct it on your paper wait it is already correct on our paper 0 that is right i need to correct it okay so we get a point okay you got a point i got a point
one okay so round 3 this is fun is not this a luck game it is a luck game it just depends .
of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than question i guess i want a turn okay you know what though i think i get to go fir .
not if it is really close and you are not sure what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it if you need to have that picture sayin put your hand down for just a moment on your whiteboard i want you to draw a picture of that number sentence use your flats your longs and your units
tenths and your hundredths okay calendar this is the picture that matches no what i was recommending this for was if you got something like this and if it was tricky and if you needed the picture
game yes buddy what if they are equal well if they are 0 if they are equal it or a tie breaker or a tie breaker you could do that too okay when you go with your partner you are going to put your whiteboards away for me
friends we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back okay so you got to make sure you get up the things you need to get up home i am going to put a prompt on the board i am going to have you write in your math notebook and then we are going to share at the very end of class after this game partners just do not bump the camera
brandon joey who is your partner okay get started
minute do not forget what is the 1st step of this game
the 1st step is you have to roll the dice and decide who writes the less than symbol all the way down their paper and then that does not change and who writes the greater than down their paper and that does not change 1st figure out who is less than and greater than
dice you only needed one dice ladies so which one are y .
too alright and laura roll it again you are going to do the whole 1st .4 let us look at that okay so 2.24 is going to be less than something
2.24 is going to be greater than something that is going to be tricky who do you think is more than likely going to get this point
alright look at your number whose is correct laura is is because hers is actually less than 2 and 44 hundredths so who gets that point paper so that means hers it correct yours is not
okay 0 i like that a tally chart that works and and less than boys i am greater than okay
we are going to do the prompt on the board in just a minute in our math notebook you went really fast huh you want to play a couple more points you can play a couple more points so is this my number he is going to finish rolling all the way across across it is just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence the other one will not be
okay and now he will do the next 4 rolls for the 3rd point
minutes you have a math notebook prompt on the board
score you all both got one.14 and one.14
hers okay roll it again
okay so she rolled a 6311 and one of these is correct the other one is not
and now you will roll the next 4 numbers boom boom boom boom okay do not forget if yours was incorrect you have got to fix it on your paper so you do not take home the wrong information yes who is your partner fatima fatima is okay alright boys and girls as you come to a stopping point .
girls eyes on me please boys friends on the floor aria board 3.7 or 3.653 point explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words you are going to do a quick write we are going to share these in about .
minutes so a quick write means you are sitting down you are getting it done home hurry away luke why do not you walk around and be the helper okay
seat madison do you mind walking around pushing in chairs so we will be ready after lunch
container madison is already started
here i am also going to pass out your homework for tonight
out which number is larger 3.7 or 3.65 explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words and also symbols and i will write your homework on the board
p pass this down to brandon and audrey please the game sheet that you guys had today now and i think someone might be missing their math notebook because it has been up here on the table
tonight miss courson i do not get it larger 3 and 7 tenths or 3 and 65 hundredths explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words
minutes keep writing pw i put ps nintey 6 because you see they have named it differently this comes from a problem solving book pw normally we put pw 960 it says ps on here too it says ps on the paper .
i like how i see kashish writ pictures maybe similar to what we did back before the game
part madison the way i know 3.7 is greater than 3.65 is because if you added 0 to 770 is greater than 65 yes that is correct one audrey 3.7 is farther on the number line so it is larger it is farther on the number line if we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class it would be down a tad would not it
 the 7 is maybe 700 yeah look at said he compared the tenths place and he knew that 7 was greater than what get 3 and 7 tenths is larger than 3 and 65 hundredths i know this because 10 times 10 is 100 so 7 times 10 is 70 and 70 is greater than 65 okay
josh i think 3 3.7 is bigger becau because it is the same thing as 3 3.70 okay saying 3 and 7th tenths is just another way of saying 3 and 70 hundredths that is why i think 3 and 7 tenths is greater than 3 and 65 hundredths did anyone draw a picture
pictures using x is or a 100s chart or dots
okay i did take one minute and share to the person to the right or to the left or across from you but turn to your elbow partner let them see your math thinking 2nd daily grade on this skill tomorrow cause i think we are good with it
aria cause i saw you having some great pictures there you could share with me too
arrows yeah very nice friends we are also going to try to work on our bridges tomorrow kay the trucks to see if they can fit across i i do not see anything this has to be able to go across your bed and this has to be able to go under your bridge kay
i am shooting for our ceremony being on february 16th that is that thursday the bridge breaking ceremony
under it has to fit because remember it has to be a certain amount of inches off the ground
1012 now where do you get that is it 1000 a large number or extra large
the section 2 pretty soon today we are going to kind of have people helping people because some people i walked around the other day and see some people have difficulties completing the last section of unit 2
2 the section 2 is really asking you to either add and these vocabularies kirby these vocabularies when you adding they ask you what question look at the vocabularies and tell me what question do they ask you when you are adding
how much is it all together or how many by now there is another question when they ask you to either add or take away or subtract subtract now one question ingrid they always ask one question when you need to take away
subtract subtract they ask you that question and we said we learned that you could do it both ways ingrid look at the vocabulary words and tell me which which word do you see more often very often yeah when we subtract how many more how many more how many more miles how many more money how much more money
so that probably i said 0 maybe i need to add that we learn how to do with both ways we could add or we could what that means when we landmark in that number and our landmark could be walk forward and or walk if you step back if you know what you are doing and some people show me that in that book when i check it some people say 0 i know what to do
now if we if we if you just turn around for a minute just turn around face back with the place value chart that we have just turn around you do not need to get up just turn around thank you all right now we have one 10 100
me then we have 1000 what do we have before that the comma the comma that separates the 1000 we bet on so this is 1000 place and it is 2 no in the 1000 place we have 2 but 10000 100000 10000 100000 let us stop there let us stop there in the 1000 place
let us see people who are really paying attention like reggie is doing good good kirby nick good job all right now we we just stop in the 1000 but not just 1000 please but that is but not just 1000 please now i want to ask you a question
in the 10000 place how many how many 10 do you think is in 10000 200 wait a minute 10000 place how many how many yes 2010 or no in the 10000 please 0 how many 100s are in
in the 10000 or how many 10 is in in now let me break it simple how many 10 is in the 10000020000 that is the simple things now next next like tomorrow and next week we are going to work in the 10000 hey 10000 place 10000 chart 10000
how many now see what you are saying rebecca rebecca now you are answering her that is not good sorry thank you now listen how many 100s is in that 10000
same right now listen we learn today
10000 and i know 10000 yep okay okay all right well how much is it
when are we going to learn about 1000000 that is a question i will answer later all right good job
now the page is that we still going to work how many 100 is in the 10000 was in here 0 yeah look at that on the board i put it how many 100 and we just learned that how many 10 is in 10000 10000 10000 so another thing yes it does sound like a 1000
exactly see now i could tell some people have good strategy it is like 5 and 200 added to number 0 we add 2 more . equal to
thank you now listen carefully i want to see people who are ready we are going back into the math book now i need i need to see people who can who are doing ingrid you do not have your math book on your desk i need to see people with their math book on the desk
but the problem that is remaining a problem for everyone is the money problem how much more money and the decimal part of the money is the one that is giving some people a hard time when they ask you when they ask them what is your change what is the change that you should have is the one
so on page listen on page 23 check for me check for me is it page 23 that asks you for a money problem is it 23 or 21 check 2323 is a money problem 231 and 23
let us see if nick are you willing 230 all right 21 will be more let me see can i see can i see yours thank you
huh 23 page 23 i do not know page 23
it rebecca 23 rebecca rebecca it is unit 5 landmark in large number and we are going to 23 very good
now let me let me ask ismael to read the problem now now i want everybody everybody is following see he is not paying attention and he is not on that page job if you are on page 23 and for these people that are have already done it
us tara saved 11 . saved 143 from her baby sister 123 $123 good job
line all right tara saved $143 from babysitting and open . a bank account a bank account so what did she do with the money
$829 more i like to hear the word more remember we are focusing more so yeah 100 more keep reading and i know something how much money does she have in the bank the bank of the year 0 this is an easy problem is that it
now i will give you a minute to solve it and do whatever they ask you to do do now you know what can i have this good job
check and see if you add right good job maybe i do not know right check and see check with your neighbor and see if you add right just check that is okay i will check with you
now could you ask that question again that last question they ask you how much money does she have in the bank in the bank did they at the end of the year now is it an altogether problem 0 yeah altogether problem or how much more how much more how much more
excellent how much how much yeah all right now you cannot move forward now you do not do that all right do not do it all right now next question next question 2 problem 2 number 2
2.49 almost . $3 2.49 almost 250 almost 250 job all right keep going yep all right how much money did she spend spend how much money did she spend no we do not need the answer some people i am going to touch yeah no no
in here how much money how much money everyone should have done how much money because i i hear a decimal how much money is the decimals in there yes yet 25 2.49 almost 2.50 right 2.49 almost 2.50 is not there
spend all right somebody is adding and i am looking i am walking around to see
your answer probably is right but if you do not pay attention to the decimal dollar sign are you really paying attention to it
you are not looking at yours okay that is the thing you know what in your after you add you need to pay attention to that you what did you do with the decimal you add do you add the decimal while you adding did you add the decimal add the decimal see that is the thing you are not paying attention to me
you do not add the decimal where are the decimals good job good job you know you are not really you did not add it and if you add it in your result there would be
it yes where is it in the answer now where is the answer where is your answer look at your answer look at your answer that is the problem i feel people have see you you see you add those decimal where did you put them 0 wow
it you do not add it but just do it just do it that is decimal that is decimal add them to the answer
yes what was the 1st price the 1st price what was it
799 and i put my dollar sign thank you okay now what is my next one
$2.492 49 and that is my decimal and 49 almost ¢50 good job all right so what do i do
ho or dollar sign and you have to put that dollar sign thank you so people start adding and you always start adding on the . one on the ones place one and then on the ones place ones place is always . 1st the left and the right side right hand side
way excuse me nick nick nick this is the ones place and we add on the right hand side he no him need your attention good job
14 carry the one and then do i carry the one or what do i do
see he is not paying attention that person i am doing it for he is not paying attention when i say add the decimal and this is i add the decimal add the decimal on one minute for your question add the decimal then what do i do then i continue carry the one carry the one yeah 88 +2 equals 10
yes yes that is 2 people rebecca is not paying attention else i am showing you how to add the decimal down here rebecca are you being fresh no
and it is so easy but some people it is easy that is why some people forget
can i go to the bathroom is that a yes
yep you give us good feedback yeah now listen listen ismael listen now what do i need they asked me a question what else do i need to do about that question nick can you help me
check your paper and see if you add a sentence some people did not and i know who but i am not saying anything and i am waiting for them to write that sentence down but some people told me i am done i am done but i see i could tell and i see
and that is why we go back for some people who already completed a lot of the work job how about you kirby did you write a sentence yes yeah what is your sentences he spend $10 to $28 10000 10000 see you did not correct now this is 10000 or 1000
i . i am glad i checked you did not add the decimal 0 it looked like . i did it because of you p now fix your p please yeah good job
ah did you write your sentence let us see this sentence good job sentence sentence good job
job now why do the last question asks you what 0 this is too easy yeah yeah can i see if you do a good job
26 let us go on page 26 26 another money where and we will see number 4 about the decimal 3 things now let us put down 3 things we learn about money problem
do rebecca rebecca rebecca i need your help 0 okay 3 things 3 things so money let us put down money problem 1st of all with that dollar sign good job problem we need we need to be careful or be careful and i will just put money problem be careful be careful we are not remember
let us put it in a sentence if you want to put it . remember in your learner is notebook today i rebecca control it
remember ah reggie one thing we need to remember when we are doing money problem and then we are going to go over decimal sign decimal sign do not forget decimal sign decimal decimal is decimal a sign no it is end it is end decimal is called end end so could i put decimal and or decimal is also and when you are reading it
so reading number 2 all right now let me wait for let me wait for juliana 2 so we need to remember decimal to add decimal end the dollar sign do not do not forget to add
she asked me a question and it is maya that remind us decimal could be read as end end and this is something sometimes we skip it or we forget $5 and $5 and and $25 and you mean a and d
and yeah or d and no not the end $2.49 and we could read could be read as $2 and 40 and see the and $48 ¢49 good job good job
all right now something we need reggie 3rd things we learn do not forget to add the dollar sign do not forget to add the decimal and the cents and the cents and the same sign yeah but once you put the dollar sign mean you know where to add it how about line or column line them in column yeah because line sometimes you get confused you get messed up
numbers line up numbers so sometimes i put this sign for numbers reggie again yeah huh sometimes i put that sign for numbers all right look at that you are supposed to know how subtracting or adding now that is one thing that is in the problem but we are talking about after we add or subtract then things we need to remember
11 me as we are adding or after we are adding i did i
¢55 yep but you add a 0 next to 5 thank you that is another thing but 3 important things you say when you finish did i when i say revise your math rebecca when i say revise your math these are the things i say 6 we are on 26
okay very good so did people get this
so things you learned today 123 ah now let us see if daphka is with us on page 26 yes yeah you are on page 26
nick close one of the starting problem above use it to solve this problem okay
do the one on top rebecca i can not really work if you are talking you are not raising your hand you can not talk to your neighbor and we need your participation away no no no notes away notes away notes away
us on the top this is 9 94 $5 so they said this one they call it a starter problem so what is the starter problem starter mean what shirley what does starter mean do not want you to go through stuff thank you it is a beginning or it is a start problem and that problem could help you solve the next one
how many people understand that the starter mean yes they give me a problem to start with or they give me something that i could look up to now what is the starter problem juliana 0 i got you wrong juliana what is the starter the starter problem tell me
the starter problem is a problem no no you do not need to repeat just tell me what is it on page 26 that we are going to start with it is a money problem it is a money problem $9949 $5 $9 and i put the dollar sign do not forget
$994909949 and 94 yes $9.94 cents thank you 9 and 94 $5 one person please one
us if you are not really wait for your turn to talk rebecca yes
did not they say $9 $5 so it is $14 now how does this starter problem will help now let me wait for rebecca rebecca is really up
yeah they give me 2 more starting problems rebecca rebecca yes now what is the next problem they give me
it it is the same okay $9.94 $5.16 that is not the next one that is not the next one
one fine $9 $5 we did that no $9 $5 so how is this going to help $9 $9 $4 so we take away the 94
do and she said we take away yeah we take away the 94 and one so we take away 194 and that gives us what only $5 left is it take away it is addition take away
you but that is $5 this is a 5 yes
let us see if they really choose it is a dollar sign okay i just now i am glad you are the one telling me now i am going to walk around and see see choose one of the starter above to do this one right one of the starter to do this one right see i still see good job good job now you have not done this one all right work on this one
one it is plus okay ooh now could you give her a hand she does not get it one you know you could all right shirley could you give her a hand sure let us see see no i know 15 okay we will find some more things to 01 all right okay that is you do not have to you do not need to do this one
i can help you all right now listen 2526 that is what we did
see 27 it is the 1st number on this is very and you have to time it by 10 by 1010 all right sit down
job see you have not done now why are you doing this now i want you to see you did not finish this could you help him with this
him you may turn over now wait here you may turn over give him a hand right here and right there when i come back i am going to check and see
job now if you add a dollar to $14 you get $15 and there is ¢10 left i got a pen one she did this one did she do a good job there she did not do the 1st one
one let us see people who are really see i am taking this i am really taking it
it i just did not do it because i was working my 1000 but do not worry no you are not doing this we need you 0 you did this 0 you also did this okay good very good so you may do the other one
0 my god
rebecca could you check with daphka and see if she really gets it
it just check daphka daphka rebecca is going to give you a little bit of help do you really need i really do not huh
yep kirby kirby kirby in your seat one minute okay
together yeah that is fine okay how is ingrid doing she is good okay good how is ismael doing
job decimal decimal is there a decimal there now
job victoria good job you and then we will all right good helpers friend helping friends reggie sit down sit sit sit sit we are done all right so next time okay shirley thank you
you let us check together all right let us see see you kids over there all right i need your attention good job
you reggie now could you tell us what he did not get it you think he gets it does so what help what help did you give him
him rebecca rebecca rebecca i need you to listen to him on hold on we are really some people are not listening let us wait for rebecca again thank you
job now we are sharing what kind of help did that person need so that person gets it and moves on few victoria i need your help when it is time to do our final sharing coming together see what we learned
so tell us again i helped with this and showed the numbers that he can not add 0 he could not add a few numbers and did he get it he can not add he could not but now he could listen reggie now he can
it all right how about somebody else he did not know how to use to break it apart break it apart just to use another problem to help solve the other problem good job all right because that one asked you to use the starter problem to help
all right let us wait for reggie again because when one is talking we need to have everyone listening so she kind of helped her with use that starter problem they already did for you to start you to get you started and then use it to solve the next problem which is similar but they make it a little bit different right
yes all right how about you shirley she had money and she did not know how to break the numbers the numbers okay ingrid did you learn something yes okay what did you learn now
money yes but i do not know the way you were talking i thought you knew when i looked at the 1st problem we did about money you told us so much that was helpful so how do you feel now not better 0 you need you will probably next time i will have i understand good job all right now one thing maggie maggie yes
we are talking here we need you she got the things but she just needed somebody to check them good job so you checked the dollar yeah yeah did you
of the decimal she is kind of like keep on forgetting about them but all the answers are right very good how do you feel daphka you get okay so the thing that we learned today what
one do you need your paper for that no you we need you to sit down i learned about large number huh i know but we did not stay and say . hm hm what did you learn about large number i do not know what is the number i wanted to are you reading are you reading for him no no no
now large number what did you learn about large number what did we do we did we broke it apart all right hold on on some people are not willing we broke it apart i have a problem we got to the 1000
1st we reviewed a few things what did we review what did we review about large number 1000 10000 and how many 100 in 10s on 10000
you that is just she is still talking what you tell me sorry so many times and i hear your voice and when we are doing our final sharing i want everybody to go home and tell their parents thank you thank you what we learned now what else so large number that is what we reviewed and you were telling me .
all right but it is your own strategy that counts one things exactly 0 i know how to do it way how about ingrid that person the other thing that we have learnt huh is when you do your money problem hold on hold on
somebody is talking in the back what do you need to put in a money problem like a decimal point decimal point in the money problem do not forget something we should never forget decimal dollar sign decimal decimal line up numbers line up numbers line up numbers correctly correctly so you could when you add in the decimal that is a vocabulary also
that is a vocabulary wait so what would be the word there are many vocabulary words we do not even put up there yeah so which one do you say we should have put up there
okay all right this is what we are going to be doing today that is okay
she likes to be sat in closets all right today we are going to do a couple of things
we talked a little bit about the area model on friday we just touched upon it today okay some of the kids had trouble in the other class simple okay hand down maneli
and then we are going to also use estimation to help us get in the right ballpark as far as our answers go okay way so let us talk about estimation 1st take out your math notebooks and let us copy this problem down
bella because it makes it easier because you will have even numbers okay but how is it going to help us like why why are we estimating why am i estimating right now before why do not why do not i just solve the problem 84 why am i making you do this extra step know because it might help us
us i already said it at the beginning of the class how is it going to help us maneli it is going to help explain what you are thinking or no it is not going to help explain my thinking patrick it is going to help us because it makes it easier okay i need something a little more clearer than that
benny like it it makes it easier how does it make it easier patrick to to make an estimation and make an estimation and get close to the answer okay it is going to help us get close to the answer which will help us do what
if we estimate it is going to help us get close to the actual answer important why is that important so you can find the answer so we can find the answer because what i have been seeing a lot okay so let me do another problem right here what i have been seeing a lot is when people are multiplying okay
when people are multiplying say i have a problem and i am doing it this way 46 what i am seeing a lot is that people are not multiplying accurately so you are not doing say you did 80 instead of 800 well your answer is going to be way off so you need to recognize that you know what i need to add one more 0 there to make it 800
and i have seen it in the previous class i saw it a lot at the beginning and i am and i see it in this class as well so if i estimate if i take 22 x 46 and i estimate that if i round the numbers up to 20 x 50 i know that my answer is going to be somewhere around a 1000
so whittler if i did make a mistake and i forgot to add a 0 and i did have 80 hopefully when i am done adding my products up i say to myself something is not right my estimate my estimation my estimate i am going to be close to a 1000
over but i know i am not going to get an answer of say 220 so it is going to help you realize that when you are computing when you are multiplying your partial products together that you know what i think i might have left out a 0
mistake so it will help us become more accurate so let us go back to the original 84 when we estimate we round we have 2 digit numbers we are going to round to the nearest 10 25 30 30 good so let us put it underneath i like to write an e for estimate for an estimate just so you know
30 okay 84 80 80 good ah multiplying with 0s right
0s 2400 so i know i am going to be somewhere around 2400 okay one of the kids at the end of the class in the previous class one of the word problems on that paper that you have excuse me when he when he did it his estimate was actually the same as the actual answer
sometimes it happens okay sometimes not all the time most of the times it will not so i know i am going to be 30 x 80 want any way that we practiced on friday okay let us go kyle solve it any way we want solve it any way you want
rectangle okay that is the way we were practicing us okay that is just to help us 25 x 84 i see ella is already working there
84 that is what you are solving right now
84 good 0 thank you keep on
one okay is it all coming back to you now
go good just be accurate with your multiplication no no
how can it be 40000 when our estimate is 2400 0s 16 are all . how many 0s are in the equation how many 0s
48 and add a 0 right 80 okay now we go to the bottom 5 x 8 is
top now you have got to do the bottom yeah nice good 0 sara sara sara sara sara 0 yeah thank you
see 0 wait no you you made the boo boo right there i did too no you were good do you recognize the boo boo recognize the mistake you said 5 x 80 is 40 last time i checked 5 x 8 is 40
you have got to add that 0 right 84 is the number right you keep the numbers the same okay alright yeah there you go 0 okay you have got to redo that i know 0 i love it
i see the same mistake all the time and this is why i am going to show you the area model 840 no 0 you copied it different okay let me see
yes you are right you are right good all right let us have okay 4 x 2 huh
488 so that should be 8 right all right whittler let me see 0 you added wrong bring your bring your paper up
answer 1600 1600 somebody refresh my memory about what the estimate was what did we say the estimate was sara 2400 2400 i am going to just write that up here estimate okay what did we multiply next we multiplied 5 x 4 we got 20
continue then we multiplied 5 x 80 8 okay we added those up and the answer is 2100
2400 are we in the right ballpark right now this is what i saw a lot today this is what i saw from at least 3 different people
you did 5 x 80 and you put 40 8 you did not add the 0 from the 80 to get 400 okay so that is a mistake that a lot of people make just because you are going and sometimes you forget
well if we look at the area model here i know i talked a little bit about it on friday somebody refresh my memory about how the area model you can go back to your seat you actually keep your notebook there for a 2nd i will give it back to you this how the area model here is different from the strategy on the board
how is the area model different from the strategy on the board
patrick can you answer the numbers are probably like 20 will be bigger and 10 times will be smaller okay he is on the i know what he is saying but let us get it exact means but let us say it exactly the way it should be
bella you did 30 going down and you did so that means you did one going down right 5 yes so would it be like area basically the length and the width are going to be i am looking for a word precise that begins with an a
exact no that is an e but that is another word
what the length and the width are going to be accurate accurate accurate yes the length and the width are going to be accurate the rectangles inside the area model are going to show what they are really supposed to look like so when i multiply with this one they do 38 x 26 so when i do 30 x 20 the answer is 600
the value of that product is going to look bigger than the other ones because i am multiplying the 2 biggest numbers together with this one up here okay this one is kind of like what they call the partial product okay we just write the equations now we do it in that rectangle because you guys and gals were having a hard time figuring out what numbers to multiply
so that is a strategy that helps us organize the partial product okay this one is showing how big the rectangles inside the area should be so when i am doing 30 x 20 hopefully if i put 60 there i realize that whoa that rectangle is way too big to be 60
0 well this little one i am going to know where to put that equation of 8 x 6 8 x 6 is by far the smallest equation there so it better go in the small rectangle right in the bottom right so we are going to learn how to make the area model today okay and if you like the area model you can continue using it
if you do not like it you can go back to using the partial product accurate you have to recognize your mistakes when you make one so if i left out a 0 i know that i have to add that 0 okay that yes okay let me show you an example of what one of the kids did in class
this i am not sure why counting so our goal today is to make the area model as you can see up here
now this is an area model of 38 x 12 okay and if we get the hang of this then i will break you up into your groups you can solve the word problems on your desk in your groups and then you can have all the work if we have time
well so look at what one of the students did 12 okay so the length they did 30
right 38 i am just going to make a little line there i will do a plus sign 30 +8 is 38 right expanded notation so they counted 30 alana and tiana 30 down with one color and then 8 down with another
so we separated the 10s place from the ones place there counting yes good you would be surprised at what i saw last class all right 12 so again she separated according to place value
she did 10 across and then 2 across okay now i used grid paper for this to help us out boxes all you do is you make a line so if the number is 38 i do 30 with one color and then 8 with another and then i can use the same 2 colors for the width or i could use 2 different colors
matter and i went 10 across and then she went 10 across and then 2 across now the reason why we use 2 different colors where the 10s place and ones place meet is right here this section right here separates the 10s place from the ones place
there and that will help us get the correct areas for each equation that we multiply so when she did 10 x 8 say you did not know your facts at all but you could make the area model 10 x 8 there is going to be 80 little squares in here
them 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and you can get your answer okay and it is going to help you because if you get stuck and you are like mister add would it make sense if you did 8 x 10 in this rectangle right here
16 if you came up here and you counted that there would be 16 boxes now the horizontal line where the 2 different colors meet is where you draw your line
that i had kids just to warn you i had kids making the line the vertical line anywhere they wanted to here so when they went to go do it it did not look right it was not accurate if i counted those squares there should be 80 squares here
if we counted this there should be 300 squares in that rectangle right there because that is the area that is the length and the width of this rectangle there should be 60 squares here so this is going to be a lot more accurate than doing it with the partial product in the rectangle okay problems i am going to pass out this type of paper okay
understand yes okay we are going to do the 1st one together if i feel like we are getting it and we can do it then i am going to break you up into your groups okay and you are going to use the area model to help you solve the word problems and some of you i have different word problems for different groups okay
some of you i might give a bigger problem too once we do it with the centimeter paper here okay once we are done with that then we can move on to doing it without it just using a regular piece of paper okay so we will talk about that as well all right
now i am going to show you when i do it on the board i am not going to use any graph paper to help me make sure you do not forget benny in the back okay so take out 2 colored crayons 32 x 24
let us write the problem at the top of your paper paper sara can you give them another one thank you is that for whoever is like watching us
yeah they are watching you right now point down they are watching me more than they are watching you what they are watching me teach more than they are watching you they are not watching the program they are showing how i teach okay okay so 32 x 241st before we even begin we are going to estimate
because when we estimate it is going to help us get in the right ballpark help us know where our answer should be exactly so 32 alex what am i going to round 32 to number 30 30 good chris 20 200 that is nice and easy
and once you get good at estimating it is something that you can just do in your head can some of you might take a little more practice 30 x 62600 see how quick you did that right question is it going to be smaller or larger than 600
why why is our answer going to be smaller or larger than 600 why
me alex we rounded down with both of the numbers there you go are 32 come on people 32 so they are larger they are larger so of course our answer is going to be larger okay our actual numbers 32 and 24 are both larger than 30 and 20
so our answer is going to be greater than 600 if you had an answer smaller than 600 that should raise a red flag okay red flag people my goodness i should have the camera emily who is also well behaved all right 32 x 24 so what you are going to do is you are going to take a color
you are not going to color in any of the squares there it and my rectangle that i make my area is going to look just like yours we are going to do 30 down so count 30 draw a line and then label it
and then you are going to take a different color and you are just going to do 2 because that would represent the ones place 2 so i have 32 now you can do this without actually drawing without using graph paper once you get the handle of it
now obviously 30 is going to be a lot greater than 2 okay no 30 down honey you have got to count 30 down draw a line right on the line me 30 down do you have 30 down
down yes sure 2 and write 2 now my only question is you did it so far over here i do not think you are going to have room to draw 24 going in a horizontal line right
try it on the back and start on the left you do not look like you where do you want to go i did not . where is 30 30 down 30 down a line 30 down can you count 30 down go ahead start at yeah there you go
30 that is not 30 honey you are drawing a line yes okay that does not look like 30 to me my dear
13 you have 14 there
30 i want a line of 30 and then with another color a line of 2
30 i can walk by and i notice that she has a line of 32 any concerns right now who can not draw a line count by 30 going down hand i will be more than happy to help you here is my 30
30 it looks okay from the yeah 20 yeah now what bella is going to do is she is going to take a color and the number is 24 20 not 15 not 10 not 19 20 stop she is going to use another color to count 4
ahead thank you thank you yes 0 sorry we have to do 20 on 123456
20 yeah good so write 20 right there now with another color make 4 separating the 10th place from the one place from right extended yeah go good write 4 right there there you go
perfect okay so that is what ella just did okay 32 then she has 20 across and then 4 across
good yeah right now all ella has to do she is basically done is she just has to close up the area model so she just takes any color she wants and she is going to close up the rectangle so she is going to take a color she is going to draw up and over so now we have a rectangle can we do that
yes okay make it happen you have a question anybody we are doing 20 on the bottom yeah we are doing 24 24 array basically okay did you have enough room you did
good is that 20 now you have to do another 4 square yeah because we are doing the number 24 and you will be okay so do not worry about it
24 even though i think that is more than 30 buddy but that is okay no okay now you think it is more than 30 yes there is 10 20 there is 30 right there that is where 30 should be
so there is 30 here is 2 so this is where it should be right here okay you see that you see that okay once you have made your rectangle close it up no 241 number
21234 okay now i have chris is paper right here
now all right that is what we are doing is we are making an array now the reason why i had you use different colors is so you know where to draw the lines here so where his orange and red vertical line meet he is going to draw a line going across is hopefully he will draw it straighter than i just did
hey that was not good so he is going to draw it across on the line and then where his horizontal line is is where the 20 meets the 4 here okay let me write it up okay right here counted he is going to draw a line going up
now if he solves it rightly if he counted this he will be able to accurately know the product for each equation that he is going to make that yes okay so draw you are going to draw a horizontal and a vertical line if you do not know good perfect let me see yours
vertical and horizontal okay vertical astronaut remember astronauts sleep because in space because of . gravity no gravity there now when she multiplies i hope she is going to realize where she puts 2 x 4
yes right and if you put 2 x 4 in this rectangle right here we have some . big problem we have a little bit of concern right so this is going to help us accurately find the answer to the product to each of the rectangles notice how we have 4 rectangles
so you are going to have 4 equations you can write the equation right inside each of them maybe not that one because it is so small okay go calista i will be right back is this perfect yes perfect yes now multiply them together
you made a loop you are not going to be and you can still get the answer but you do not have 32 here you have 31 see that how you only have one right there see how he has 2 rows right 0 yeah you can still figure it out
dominic can i help you no dominic you do not do that huh who ellis emily is this is emily is yes that is ellis and this is emily is perfect okay multiply them together okay see what you have right here draw a line here all the way across and draw a line here okay you got it
4 watch if i do not know look i can count 2468 is my answer right yeah it is right there it is perfect perfect now solve it
alex alex wrote 24 on the top and the bottom that is okay helps kyle can you look here so we can do it right bud all right so he did 30 x 20 now if i wanted to torture alex which i might later on i might have him count every single square here and if he counted every single square there would be 600 because 30 x 20 is 600
yes awesome 600 i like how he wrote the equation inside the inside the rectangle okay perfect so he has 4 arrays here 20 then below this he wrote 20 here look he is going to do 2 x 20 and he is going to have 40
if he counted each of those squares there would be 40 squares there so 2 x 20 is 40 so unlike using the rectangle or the box some people call it right which just has 4 even rectangles this is giving us the actual answer for each equation okay
so if you did 30 x 20 and you forgot to add a 0 and you said 60 you should know that you made a mistake is then 2 x 4 is a small equation and we have a small answer and we have a small rectangle there we have a small array right here 8 and then the last one 30 x 4
okay 30 x 4 is 120 there is 120 squares right here in this array that yes question patrick yes yes okay i think we need to try at least one more
over if you used both sides already then just get your other paper that is why i gave you 2 papers huh okay i know i am walking around you do not have to show me
smaller let us do 20 28 x 12 now before we begin we are going to estimate i always want you to yes we are going to do that
estimate so write down the actual problem and then we are going to estimate you should always estimate before you solve the problem some of you chris i feel pretty confident that you could do that in your head right yes so i am going to put you to the test in a 2nd so 28 chris rounded is what 30 30 10 i mean 12 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
what is 30 x 10 down so we know that 28 x 12 is going to be somewhere around 300 so if we have an answer like 3000 we know that we did something wrong and if we can do the area model correctly we know that we are going to be extremely accurate
120 the pen do not feel me now his button is flashing is it
yeah the pen do not feel me i can not do that tapping thing there it goes okay 28 x 12 i am going to separate the 28 into a 20 +8 right color so the 10s place is going to be a different color than the ones place
okay so 20 with one color red so i am going to count down 20 right
go ahead ella with a crayon 20 and then a different color place 8 not color but draw a line
number i am just separating the 10s place and the ones place okay 12 make sure you count it that like this just like if that is 28 then you did it right
questions horizontal line 12 so i might use the same 2 colors i might use 2 different colors it does not matter i am going to do 10 this time
paper you still want to be fairly accurate and then 2 for the 12 smaller okay so i have my l
i am just going to finish making my array it does not matter what color it is okay now where your 2 lines meet you are going to draw 2 lines line and i am going to draw my vertical line
now even though i did not use graph paper i bet you your array that you just made is going to look a lot like mine i can look at bella is right now i can look at maneli right now here and theirs looks a lot like mine except the lines are straighter right okay so finish it off right here
finish it off up and over perfect perfect now write your equations okay okay label 28 good we will draw a line here and draw a line here okay right now you are good to go
perfect and if you get stuck you can count now do 10 and 2 up there and you can even do 10 and 2 down there it does not matter good
when you have your area model set up solve the equation i just got here 0 you just got here 0 instrument people okay you are going to have to rely on jasmine to help you out here
the array is going to be accurate when we do this right all the rectangles are the same yeah i am good okay before the camera leaves let us solve this problem somebody john tell me an equation
10 x 8 equals 80
8 does it matter if i do 8 x 10 or 10 x 8 no no it does not okay here it goes 80 somebody tell me another equation
prosper 10 x 20 equals 200 it good 20 x 10 equals 200 arrays calissa huh 2 x 8 and which one is that going in
bottom right bottom right excellent more somebody jordan
20 40 we add up our answers 3 okay and we are all set again 300 300 let us see what we get
280 40 +16 is 56 300 our actual answer is 336
okay she likes to be sat in closets all right things we talked a little bit about the area model on friday today okay some of the kids had trouble in the other class simple okay hand down maneli
and then we are going to also use estimation to help us get in the right ballpark as far as our answers go okay way so let us talk about estimation 1st take out your math notebooks and let us copy this problem down
25 x 84 okay
why is it why is it a good strategy to do bella because it makes it easier because you will have even numbers okay but how is it going to help us like why why are we estimating why am i estimating right now before why do not why do not i just solve the problem
know because it might help us how is it going to help us maneli it is going to help explain what you are thinking or no it is not going to help explain my thinking patrick
it is going to help us because it makes it easier okay i need something a little more clearer than that benny like it it makes it easier how does it make it easier
patrick to to make an estimation and make an estimation and get close to the answer okay it is going to help us get close to the answer which will help us do what if we estimate it is going to help us get close to the actual answer why is that important why is that important
so you can find the answer so we can find the answer because what i have been seeing a lot okay so let me do another problem right here what i have been seeing a lot is when people are multiplying okay when people are multiplying say i have a problem and i am doing it this way
22 x 46 what i am seeing a lot is that people are not multiplying accurately so you are not doing say you did 80 instead of 800 well your answer is going to be way off so you need to recognize that you know what i need to add one more 0 there to make it 800 and i have seen it in the previous class
i saw it a lot at the beginning and i am and i see it in this class as well so if i estimate if i take 22 x 46 and i estimate that if i round the numbers up to 20 x 50 i know that my answer is going to be somewhere around a 1000
so whittler if i did make a mistake and i forgot to add a 0 and i did have 80 hopefully when i am done adding my products up i say to myself something is not right my estimate my estimation my estimate i am going to be close to a 1000
over but i know i am not going to get an answer of say 220 so it is going to help you realize that when you are computing when you are multiplying your partial products together that you know what i think i might have left out a 0
mistake so it will help us become more accurate so let us go back to the original 84 when we estimate we round we have 2 digit numbers 10 25 30 30 good so let us put it underneath i like to write an e for estimate for an estimate just so you know
30 okay 84 80 80 good ah multiplying with 0s right
0s 2400 so i know i am going to be somewhere around 2400 okay one of the kids at the end of the class in the previous class one of the word problems on that paper that you have excuse me
when he when he did it his estimate was actually the same as the actual answer will not so i know i am going to be 30 x 80
friday okay let us go kyle solve it any way we want solve it any way you want rectangle okay that is the way we were practicing us okay that is just to help us
25 x 84 i see ella is already working there now 25 x 84
84 25 x 84 good 0 thank you
one okay is it all coming back to you now
go good just be accurate with your multiplication no how can it be 40000 when our estimate is 2400 all right so let us 25 84
20 x 80 0s 16 are all . how many 0s are in the equation how many 0s 2 1600 right 20 x 4
48 and add a 0 right 80 okay now we go to the bottom 80 yeah 0 400 5 x 4 is
yes and then this will be the answer that will be the answer yes there okay 0 bottom right
see 0 wait no you you made the boo boo right there mistake you said 5 x 80 is 40 last time i checked 5 x 8 is 40
good good i will be right there good good yeah no there you have got to add all these up
good ah mistake right here 8 you have got to add that 0 right 84 is the number right that i know 0 i love it
i see the same mistake all the time and this is why i am going to show you the area model 840 no 0 you copied it different okay let me see yes you are right you are right good all right let us have okay 4 x 2 huh
8 4 x 2 488 so that should be 8 right all right whittler let me see wrong bring your bring your paper up
yeah yeah add them up and you get your answer
80 yes and what did we get as an answer 1600 1600 somebody refresh my memory about what the estimate was what did we say the estimate was sara 2400 2400 i am going to just write that up here
estimate okay what did we multiply next continue then we multiplied 5 x 80
400 good then we multiplied 20 x . 20 x what 20 x 4 and you got 8
2400 are we in the right ballpark right now this is what i saw a lot today this is what i saw from at least 3 different people
you did 5 x 80 and you put 40 8 you did not add the 0 from the 80 to get 400 okay so that is a mistake that a lot of people make just because you are going and sometimes you forget well if we look at the area model here i know i talked a little bit about it on friday
somebody refresh my memory about how the area model you can go back to your seat 2nd i will give it back to you this how the area model here is different from the strategy on the board
how is the area model different from the strategy on the board
patrick can you answer the numbers are probably like 20 will be bigger and 10 times will be smaller okay he is on the i know what he is saying but let us get it exact means but let us say it exactly the way it should be
bella you did 30 going down and you did so that means you did one going down right 5 yes so would it be like area basically the length and the width are going to be i am looking for a word
a exact no that is an e but that is another word what the length and the width are going to be accurate accurate accurate yes the length and the width are going to be accurate the rectangles inside the area model are going to show what they are really supposed to look like
so when i multiply with this one they do 38 x 26 so when i do 30 x 20 the answer is 600 the value of that product is going to look bigger than the other ones because i am multiplying the 2 biggest numbers together
with this one up here okay this one is kind of like what they call the partial product okay we just write the equations now we do it in that rectangle because you guys and gals were having a hard time figuring out what numbers to multiply so that is a strategy that helps us organize the partial product okay this one is showing how big the rectangles inside the area should be
so when i am doing 30 x 20 hopefully if i put 60 there i realize that whoa that rectangle is way too big to be 60 0 well this little one i am going to know where to put that equation of 8 x 6
8 x 6 is by far the smallest equation there so it better go in the small rectangle right in the bottom right today okay and if you like the area model you can continue using it if you do not like it you can go back to using the partial product accurate you have to recognize your mistakes when you make one
so if i left out a 0 i know that i have to add that 0 okay that yes okay let me show you an example of what one of the kids did in class this i am not sure why
counting so our goal today is to make the area model as you can see up here now this is an area model of 38 x 12
okay and if we get the hang of this then i will break you up into your groups you can solve the word problems on your desk in your groups and then you can have all the work if we have time well so look at what one of the students did
12 okay so the length they did 30 right 38 i am just going to make a little line there
notation so they counted 30 alana and tiana 30 down with one color and then 8 down with another so we separated the 10s place from the ones place there
good you would be surprised at what i saw last class all right 12 so again she separated according to place value she did 10 across and then 2 across okay now i used grid paper for this to help us out boxes all you do is you make a line
so if the number is 38 i do 30 with one color and then 8 with another and then i can use the same 2 colors for the width or i could use 2 different colors it does not matter and i went 10 across and then she went 10 across and then 2 across now the reason why we use 2 different colors
where the 10s place and ones place meet is right here this section right here separates the 10s place from the ones place there and that will help us get the correct areas for each equation that we multiply
so when she did 10 x 8 say you did not know your facts at all but you could make the area model 10 x 8 there is going to be 80 little squares in here them 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and you can get your answer okay and it is going to help you because if you get stuck and you are like mister
porter i do not know what numbers i have to add would it make sense if you did 8 x 10 in this rectangle right here 80 8 x 2 is 16 if you came up here and you counted that there would be 16 boxes
now the horizontal line where the 2 different colors meet is where you draw your line that i had kids just to warn you i had kids making the line the vertical line anywhere they wanted to
here so when they went to go do it it did not look right accurate if i counted those squares there should be 80 squares here if we counted this there should be 300 squares in that rectangle right there because that is the area rectangle there should be 60 squares here
so this is going to be a lot more accurate than doing it with the partial product in the rectangle okay problems i am going to pass out this type of paper okay understand yes okay we are going to do the 1st one together if i feel like we are getting it and we can do it then i am going to break you up into your groups
okay and you are going to use the area model to help you solve the word problems and some of you i have different word problems for different groups okay
too once we do it with the centimeter paper here okay once we are done with that then we can move on to doing it without it just using a regular piece of paper okay so we will talk about that as well all right
see sarah i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody everybody so everybody should have 2 pieces of paper okay
because we are going to do one problem per side
the goal is to be so good at making the area model you can do it as quick as making the other rectangle okay
now i am going to show you when i do it on the board i am not going to use any graph paper to help me back okay so take out 2 colored crayons 32 x 24
let us write the problem at the top of your paper paper sara can you give them another one thank you is that for whoever is like watching us
down they are watching me more than they are watching you what they are watching me teach more than they are watching you they are not watching the program they are showing how i teach okay okay so 32 x 24
watch what i do 1st before we even begin we are going to estimate because when we estimate it is going to help us get in the right ballpark help us know where our answer should be round not exactly so 32 alex what am i going to round 32 to
good 24 chris 20 200 that is nice and easy and once you get good at estimating it is something that you can just do in your head can some of you might take a little more practice 62600 see how quick you did that right
question is it going to be smaller or larger than 600 why why is our answer going to be smaller or larger than 600 why jasmine we have not heard from you all day jasmine why is our number is our actual answer going to be smaller or larger
i only rounded the 10s so you said i only rounded the 10s and you have to round the ones alex we rounded down with both of the numbers there you go are 32 come on people 32 so they are larger
larger so of course our answer is going to be larger okay our actual numbers 32 and 24 are both larger than 30 and 20 so our answer is going to be greater than 600 if you had an answer smaller than 600 that should raise a red flag okay goodness i should have the camera emily who is also well behaved
24 so what you are going to do is you are going to take a color you are not going to color in any of the squares there it and my rectangle that i make my area is going to look just like yours we are going to do 30 down so count 30 draw a line and then label it
and then you are going to take a different color and you are just going to do 2 because that would represent the ones place 2 so i have 32 now you can do this without actually drawing without using graph paper once you get the handle of it
now obviously 30 is going to be a lot greater than 2 okay go is it like this
down yes sure okay 30 2 and write 2 now my only question is you did it so far over here i do not think you are going to have room to draw 24 going in a horizontal line right
left you do not look like you where do you want to go i did not . where is 30 30 down 30 down a line 30 down can you count 30 down ahead start at yeah there you go
30 that is not 30 honey yes okay that does not look like 30 to me my dear
13 you have 14 there
30 i want a line of 30 and then with another color a line of 2
30 i can walk by and i notice that she has a line of 32 any concerns right now who can not draw a line count by 30 going down 30 okay because i am not seeing it
30 it looks okay from the yeah 20 yeah now what bella is going to do is she is going to take a color and the number is 24 20 not 15 not 10 not 19 20 and then she is going to stop she is going to use another color to count 4
so can we all make an l please yes go ahead thank you thank you you can still do it 20 that looks more than 30
on 123456 there now with another color make 4 place from right extended
perfect okay so that is what ella just did okay 32 then she has 20 across and then 4 across right now all ella has to do she is basically done is she just has to close up the area model
so she just takes any color she wants and she is going to close up the rectangle so she is going to take a color she is going to draw up and over so now we have a rectangle that yes okay make it happen you have a question
anybody we are doing 20 on the bottom yeah we are doing 24 24 array basically okay did you have enough room
did good is that 24 square yeah because we are doing the number 24
24 even though i think that is more than 30 buddy but that is okay yes there is 10 20 there is 30 right there
be so there is 30 here is 2 so this is where it should be right here okay you see that you see that okay once you have made your rectangle close it up no 241 number
21234 okay now i have chris is paper right here now all right that is what we are doing is we are making an array
now the reason why i had you use different colors is so you know where to draw the lines here so where his orange and red vertical line meet he is going to draw a line going across is hopefully he will draw it straighter than i just did
hey that was not good so he is going to draw it across on the line and then where his horizontal line is is where the 20 meets the 4 here okay let me write it up okay right here counted he is going to draw a line going up
now if he solves it rightly if he counted this he will be able to accurately know the product for each equation that he is going to make that yes okay so draw you are going to draw a horizontal and a vertical line
yours vertical and horizontal okay vertical astronaut remember astronauts sleep because in space because of . gravity no gravity
there now when she multiplies i hope she is going to realize where she puts 2 x 4 right and if you put 2 x 4 in this rectangle right here we have some . big problem we have a little bit of concern right so this is going to help us accurately find the answer to the product to each of the rectangles
rectangles so you are going to have 4 equations you can write the equation right inside each of them maybe not that one because it is so small okay go calista i will be right back is this perfect yes perfect
together you made a loop you are not going to be and you can still get the answer but you do not have 32 here 31 see that how you only have one right there see how he has 2 rows right 0 yeah
who ellis emily is this is emily is yes that is ellis and this is emily is perfect okay multiply them together here draw a line here all the way across
here okay you got it count 2468 is my answer right perfect perfect it solve it
alex alex wrote 24 on the top and the bottom helps kyle can you look here so we can do it right bud right so he did 30 x 20 now if i wanted to torture alex which i might later on i might have him count every single square here and if he counted every single square there would be 600 because 30 x 20 is 600
brianna yes awesome 600 i like how he wrote the equation inside the inside the rectangle perfect so he has 4 arrays here 20 then below this he wrote 20 here look he is going to do 2 x 20 and he is going to have 40
if he counted each of those squares there would be 40 squares there so 2 x 20 is 40 so unlike using the rectangle or the box some people call it right which just has 4 even rectangles this is giving us the actual answer for each equation okay
so if you did 30 x 20 and you forgot to add a 0 and you said 60 you should know that you made a mistake is then 2 x 4 is a small equation and we have a small answer and we have a small rectangle there we have a small array right here 8 and then the last one 30 x 4
okay 30 x 4 is 120 array does everybody see that yes question patrick yes yes okay i think we need to try at least one more
over if you used both sides already then just get your other paper that is why i gave you 2 papers huh okay i know mister porter okay so the next one
smaller let us do 20 28 x 12 now before we begin we are going to estimate i always want you to yes we are going to do that you can do it here but do not do anything yet
estimate so write down the actual problem and then we are going to estimate you should always estimate before you solve the problem some of you chris i feel pretty confident that you could do that in your head right 2nd so 28 chris rounded is what 30 30 10 i mean 12 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
what is 30 x 10 down so we know that 28 x 12 is going to be somewhere around 300 so if we have an answer like 3000 we know that we did something wrong and if we can do the area model correctly we know that we are going to be extremely accurate 12 so that means 28 x 12
0 the pen do not feel me now his button is flashing is it
me i can not do that tapping thing there it goes okay 12 i am going to separate the 28 into a 20 +8 right
color so the 10s place is going to be a different color than the ones place line once you get the hang of it you will not have to do that okay so 20 with one color
red so i am going to count down 20 right go ahead ella with a crayon 20 and then a different color
place 8 not color but draw a line number i am just separating the 10s place and the ones place okay
12 make sure you count it that like this just like if that is 28 then you did it right questions horizontal line
12 so i might use the same 2 colors time notice that my 10 here is a lot smaller than the 20 paper you still want to be fairly accurate
and then 2 for the 12 smaller okay so i have my l array it does not matter what color it is
okay now where your 2 lines meet you are going to draw 2 lines line and i am going to draw my vertical line
now even though i did not use graph paper i bet you your array that you just made is going to look a lot like mine
here and theirs looks a lot like mine except the lines are straighter right
perfect now write your equations okay okay label 28
good we will draw a line here and draw a line here perfect and if you get stuck you can count
good when you have your area model set up solve the equation people okay you are going to have to rely on jasmine to help you out here i like friday is friday is my favorite okay instead of just making a rectangle like we did last week what we are doing is we are doing an area model
so this is going to be the arrays are going to be exact there 20 x 10 there is going to be 200 squares right here okay be the array is going to be accurate when we do this right all the rectangles are the same
yeah i am good okay before the camera leaves let us solve this problem somebody john tell me an equation 10 x 8 equals 80
8 does it matter if i do 8 x 10 or 10 x 8 no no it does not okay here it goes 80 somebody tell me another equation
prosper 10 x 20 equals 200 it good 20 x 10 equals 200 left 2 more arrays calissa huh 2 x 8 and which one is that going in
bottom right bottom right excellent and then i have one more jordan there is one more array
20 40 we add up our answers 3 okay and we are all set again 300 300 let us see what we get 280 40 +16 is 56
336 our estimate was 300 our actual answer is 336
