okay class today we are going to talk about volume and when we talk about volume we have to think about 3 dimensions the length the height and the width okay
so we know for a fact that volume is equal to what alan length width height length times width times height height 3 dimensions okay
start point let us call the start point okay here so i am going to start right here much or how many units
units so i am going to count 123456 this is the length 6 the width because remember that we are using 3 dimensions so our box is going to be 3 dimensional
so everything is going to be here so it is going to be 123455 so i have the 3 dimensions in my face of 6 units by 4 units by 5 units
so the length the width and the height box i am going to plot the same thing but in the same direction okay so let us think about the length
the length in this line is going to be how many units units 123456 that is my length okay
here so i have one face of my box now we already did the length let us do the width let us continue with the width
starting right here you are going to count 1234 because the width is equal 4
okay so that should be connected right here right sides from here how many units i have to count to put the height
jaime 55123455 and what about from here james or jaime the height how many
units 12345 okay i need another height and it is right here
so i just have to connect my corners remember vertices vertices when it is more than one when it is only one okay i am going to connect this and i am going to connect this can you visualize the box
yes okay now let us make sure that our dimensions is the same everywhere 6 length 4 width 5 height what dimension is that one juliana 5 what dimension is length height it is a height and height is
5 let us count 12345 so this is 51 daniel 4 what dimension is that 18 who can help daniel
carlos the width the width and the width is 12344 daniel again what dimension is that one length length and the length is 6123456
6 now this dimension is what dimension length height height the one that i am tracing right now length and length is how many units
units so everywhere you go what about this 11 cutting height height and height is units so everywhere you go our box is it has the same dimensions
but before that if we have to apply that formula to find the volume of this box what we should what are we suppose to do
so let us say volume of this box right here and we are going to say that this box is a and the one that you are going to make is b okay so for box number a what is the volume alan 6 x 4 x 5
okay volume will be 6 times 4 times 55 and how much is that 120 how did you figure it out luis
i did 6 x 4 equals 24 and i did 24 x 5 equals 120 120 so the volume is 120 this 14 units by 9 units by 11 units
and just follow the steps that i did in this box foreign language okay foreign language i am going to ask some questions about it so you need to figure out if you are going to use the paper and landscape
landscape wait yes show show to the whole class what landscape means means like that so you have to decide in what way you are going to do that you need to use your ruler
it you have to look for that point in this plane or grid plot it and then connect those points and make the box yes can we use colors you are going to use color at the end kevin used a ruler okay kevin do you have a ruler with this you have a ruler
foreign language okay
foreign language okay portrait landscape you need to use pencil
again in this box if you look at the box how many faces in this box
6 can you go over there and count it for me so the whole class will see how many faces or sides you see in the box it 123456 and 6 in the back okay
diego and remember at the end that you need to label label your box
this you are using the portrait so i am going to look like this did the length the length and how many units on the length 1414 okay now you just put 14 length is equal 14 and this is what
width the width so you put w and the value of the width which is
units and the height 1111 so height is 11 now you have the front part and the bottom part of the box
now luis can you tell me how what are you doing right here i am doing the length 1st then i am doing the width and then the height so you need to label any unit that you count there with a little period there label means also showing me this okay
count so for length is 14 yes now bryan what faces of the box do you have already here
i already did the front i am still working on i am trying to do the top of the top so you only need to connect those 2 right here part huh and so you need the bottom part and the back part of the box
huh whoever finishes 1st i want the person to go and plot those on the board and tell the class the steps that you followed to plot those points on the grid and what did you find 1st 2nd and 3rd
sometimes we use strategies to beginning with the bottom or the top or the front it does not matter you have to go by the dimensions
dimensions of length width and height
carlos okay i think you got it carlos are you making sure that units 99 how many units do you have there
points 99 okay so i see that carlos is done with the length width and height
carlos you want to go over there and plot those points on the grid
okay let me see if i have enough sometimes .
okay i am going to trace a little line between because we are not going to have enough when we are going to put it here
so i am going to try to be right in the middle like this to have enough we are assuming that this is even okay
did anybody find out already the volume of the box
okay almost okay
try to be as much as i can very accurate okay is that the volume okay now class carlos is going to explain carlos you can use the purple one which is dark
is that the volume yes we are not going to do now the volume that is going to be at the end here so i am going to give you the maybe the point is going to be maybe right here
class you doing the length so that is going to be the length you can just trace it huh exactly and make a big one right here too
length 1414 right 1423456789 units good for you okay and the height is
1111 width is 9 the height is 11 okay carlos
right there i can give you a hand on that okay for the height carlos our box is going to be more than that it is going to be huge up there so we are not going to have a space for that okay this right here and so one just try to do the .
as much as you can carlos okay it is right there okay so try to connect it like that okay
good for you carlos so the height is
units carlos we cannot go more because we are not going to have a space for that
so we have the front and the bottom of our box thank you carlos now who can tell me what is the volume of that
volume the volume is so to get the volume we just have to multiply 14 x 9 x 11
how much is that bryan landaverde 13861386 who is agreeing with that
sir how did you figure it out how much is 14 times 9 how much is 14 times 45360 so 360 times 11 is that okay
so let us find out 14 times 9 much 3630660 it cannot be 9 how much is 4 times 9
636 and one times 99 is 9 +31212 so 14 times 9 is a 126 and then you multiply 126 times what
1111 and that would be 6 821621 it is going to be 6831 so you have the same thing okay
1386 that means that means that with those 3 dimensions that box can carry 1386
13086 okay the main focus for this was what i am trying to get from you people is to learn how to identify the length the width and the height
mister jones now listen carefully listen again all right this morning we will continue exploring exploring fractions
all right and fractions now remember fraction we are only revising a few things before we get into the practice fractions now fabio could you tell us something about fraction yes one half is the biggest one half is the biggest fraction good so we put the word biggest greatest larger
larger this is comparing so you are kind of comparing or ordering 118th is the smallest one for which one this 18th was the smallest but that is not the smallest fraction there is more fraction could go down low low low
set so we did fraction of an area fraction of a set fraction of a group on we are going to revise a few minutes for 2 minutes that is why i have you all together here so we could look at it and explore more and go deeper and then go in the practice in your book
page i am going to put them on the board the page that i would like you to work with a partner when we finish some people no no know and some people i already kind of know but i am going to walk around and see how do you integrate the practice we did i mean the lesson we introduced and i put a few posters up there about fraction now what do we notice in a fraction something we talked about yesterday
and we talked about right somebody yeah numerator numerator and a denominator there is always and what did we learn i am going to pick on one person naila when we say yeah when we say numerator or denominator tell me something about denominator naila naila
represent what does when you see the denominator what do i have in mind the whole process the whole thing everything everything of the fraction that means the whole area or the whole group or the whole set it is the denominator like i have 3 fractions up there
3 i have and then hold on i have a half and i have 58th i mean 510th and i have 244 and it is the all halves but we could tell 510th and 10 is the .
into 1010 pieces 10 pieces that is the big idea all right now i bring this part too i bring i bring this part that show you the whole the fraction how many how many in this fraction one half 2 whole see it is 2
but it is 2 halves right and then we have the whole again from 0 it is a fraction line from 0 half to one half yes 2 halves all right see all right next one if we want to divide it the whole in
yep and nixon and michael and michael yes and michael so if i want to divide my .
my whole into halves or if i want to divide my whole in 4 people yeah so this is my whole this is 14th 24th which is the same as .
you and i have 34th which is the same as one half 1213rd yeah 14th i am going like this one half 13rd kind of close to 13rd but it is kind of
well wait a minute what you said is fine it is kind of close 3 fourths is kind of almost 4 fourths almost so it is very close to 4 fourths which is the whole thing
because i break it into 4 pieces and i could do the same here for 5 and if i have my whole and i go into .
is what happened so i have 15th 2 fifths 3 fifths 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 5 fifths so which is closer excuse me which is closer 334th and 45th or 34th and 35th which which one is closer 34th . which one is closer together
similar closer together 34th could you maybe put your that is it 34th 35th 34th and 35th or 34th and 45th 34th are they almost both of 25th almost a whole yeah they kind of almost right and then we are looking into 8th that is the 8th 8th the 8th and then see
did half become 4th 4th become 8 which name 4th become become 8th if i want to put my whole into smaller fraction 8th right then if i want to go that same half i want to put it in 5th and that 5th i want to put it in 10th what am i doing here when i am looking right here excuse me
excuse me when i am looking right here look look look i put that 55th right here 55th and i am lining it up with the half so what are we doing the pattern equivalent thank you yeah yeah
look we have the vocabulary up there equivalent small group now let us look at a group we we did the group before but now we are going to go over it again before i send you into the practice in your book with the pattern all right in a minute now look at me
up you may go and fix it for me please what thank you thank you thanks good job
it thanks all right now listen may i have your attention attention again christine i need your attention the day before this is what we did and that is why we revised it on the poster when i put the poster up when i put the poster up so people are able are able to look at what we are
those posters that i put up so people are kind of looking 0 we did this but we are going to do it for a group all right look again look look this is .
see we take the group and we you remember we had a half we put the group in half in half all right then we said half of this group we did the half this way and we did it that way also
way all right we did half the 2 different ways way and we decided we decided ways half or or .
121224 because we know for . equivalent the rectangle and we also go with the equivalent all right so 12 24 is half of this fraction or this set or this group or this group let me wait for rudy yeah rudy yeah show me
thank you all right next one come here all right next one we were going to 14th 14th of that half or we could decide we decided we decided 4th or 4th of that same set is .
6 is 6 pieces and it is out of the whole thing which is 24 and 14th we put it right there the equivalent of for this set which is 24 is thank you
6 yeah so 14th how many how many of this how many 4th is of half 6 but another word for this 4th is what
half half of what half of the half of the half half of the half is 6 half of the half is 14th that is what we were looking into again and let us continue this anybody anybody anybody you need to raise raise your hand please let me go into luji
luji what is this here can you read this fraction only luji thank you here we can leave this one which is 14th now how many 4th of this one luji how many 4th wait a minute 12 .
34th 34th 34th is this 14th 24th 34th 0 i could do it this way 14th 24th 34th 0
and what do i have here that is shaded 34th 34th and that this is not 24th but this is 34th 34th of the whole set is shaded and that 34th 0 i put it right here i had it right here that 34th is how many
that this was 6 but i have 3 of these
it 81219 she is not even looking you are not even looking up there 3 look look look look some people are not looking let me see those that are i know if ludi was looking she would be the 1st one telling me
naila chrislene chrislene can you yeah thank you now chrislene i have 14th here which is 624 now 34th must be how many pieces chrislene 4 yeah back 34th must be how many pieces luji
luji look up there i have 14th look 14th is 6 pieces of the whole set 34th must be how many pieces 3 thank you 34th is how many of the whole set
too see you were able to get it but some wait a minute ludi ludi yes your attention is on me all right so next one you now look at me what i have done
yes if anybody want to help camille they can raise their hand now what am i doing i am going down i am going down so the fraction is going one half 14th and this one become 13 excuse me
set what do i read this fraction it is half of 14th it is 3 pieces you people are not really paying attention the same word odd numbers but they are not really looking like dolly is not really yeah okay with jimmy i know it is one and .
me 0 samantha is really there because we have done this before we are revising yes all right now excuse me now somebody now i have naila back now naila can you explain why do we call this 18th yeah why do we call this 18th because . look at this one and look at this one
why do we call this 18th okay why do we call this 18th 0 somebody is ready naila can you explain yes sir you so 3 and . that is why we call it another name an equivalent of this one
324324 which is equivalent to 18th for this set
me 0 yeah that same set and how many is in this set 24 so we know 3 pieces is how many what fraction 3 pieces 3 pieces is what fraction 18th 18th of the whole set and that is 324
you thank you very much it is hard to it is hard to keep it up no wakudowali let us go wakudowali right michael what else did we learn we learned 18th let us go back
we are revising a little bit let us go back one more fraction we learned with the whole set
wow okay half we will put one half and one half must be this way 1224 okay
1224 right another fraction we learned for the set yes 14th and we put them in order and that 14th must be
okay all right so that is what what do we call it what is the equivalent 624th 624th i have you back 624th now listen this is a new question and people need to think
you need to think and i am letting people think hm on excuse me
13rd of my 24 pieces see yeah good rudy is talking over there i am looking for 13rd i want to eat 13rd how many pieces would that be
13rd no sorry 4 okay back back back
them 212 somebody somebody is waiting i am nixon collins collins darlene good job now listen i am going to ask one person and if it is if you find that same answer do not tell me what to do please all right now if it is listen
darlene now if it is the same answer we got to that person what do we do leave it out there yes yes all right now rudy i am always calling your name and i know you very .
many how many pieces would it be in what fraction numerator and denominator now let me wait for camille camille how many pieces we said 13rd of this set
one some people are not listening some people were not listening i heard some people were talking excuse me nixon do not do that thank you up nixon so i hear 3 people were talking and i heard the answer kind of but i was not sure
right nixon what did you talk me about i said we said we said we talked about yeah we talked about listen listen girls girls yeah we said 12 over 24
is half yes yeah and then we are going to see the 13rd yeah 13rd must be be 13rd i am going to find this and i .
okay that is what you talked about right yeah now let me go to another group okay let me go to another group excuse me listen if it is your answer you need to go yes but if it is not then you need to say 0 how how hold on dolly dolly listen listen to another group thank you
yes michael calm down all right listen why is 18th somebody was telling me yesterday me okay all right so 8 x 3 is 24
on i am showing you something very important 4 times 6 is 24 and that is why we see 0 this is 14th we transfer what we have learned before into the fraction all right another 12 times 12 is 24 and that is how we know half is 24
now can we use that strategy to get 13rd maybe what can we do to get 13rd what can we time 3 times 83 times equal 24 that tells us how many pieces 8 pieces not 18th 8 pieces that is what i asked you how many pieces would be 13rd hold on
you said i heard you were saying that but you missed kind of you go with 18th 18th is something different to a fraction you know what
listen i am trying to kind of help you understand the way you said it and the way you told me is different so 13rd must be let me see 123456785678 so let us see look before we go into our book so this is what we call 13rd and how many pieces is that
8 good 53rd so now how many 8 look she is not looking she is not looking she is thank you
yes so 18th 18th 18th how many 8th how many 8th how many 8th 6
see 18th 18th 18th how many 8th 33 times 824 so the fraction for 18th another way an equivalent fraction would be is it 324 or 824824 because it is 8 pieces we call it 320 .
328 how many pieces 328 no but if i have the whole thing is 24 aha 3 look look we said 13rd is 624 so this one must be how many pieces 888 pieces so 824 is the same equivalent to .
324 is the same equivalent to 13rd of this set thank you yep all right yes now any questions let me see people that has questions regarding regarding regarding the fraction of this set
set now if i have 16th i mean 13rd 13rd becomes 16th because half of 3 is 6 be the smart people let me call see the smart people excuse me
16th 13rd is 8 pieces so 82416th must be 44240 you all getting it see now i get you back
see so this one is equal same thing as 4 24 you luji do i really get you back yes you get this piece yes when i say 16th must be because 13rd is 824
so if i go 16th must be e times e see what we are doing we are matching facts time factors
area the denominator i see some people are not paying attention so what i am going to do and i will go to 13rd 16th and one no 14th 112th 118th 0
yes why do you say 112th if i am going down 13rd 16th 112th what would it be had 84th yeah she gets it 2 if i go 112th equals 2 .
2 oops sorry 224th 124th 124th 124th is what one 148th 148th okay job i like that all right now another one and then we will go into our book
yes yeah and practice and practice now remember we went into a different different set set we went into 13rd for this set set people that are looking with me 13rd see 13rd of this set
let me see 13rd let me make it 13rd some people those guys on my left are good are good are smart are smart i get it
smart you are getting me back getting me back fine now listen carefully listen we have a different different set which is we were looking for set 313rd wait a minute let me see
so it is 13rd is so i have it into 3 yes now i see some people are looking some people are talking and some people see those people that are talking they will not be able to do
on let us wait for the talking so i can do a little bit of it and guide it to chrisline my favorite naila
that is right 13rd +13rd equals 2 and 2 thirds of the whole set set of the whole piece or of the whole area guys okay and they call themselves the smartest you got back me
listen 13rd 23rd can i have 16th yeah 16th yes
now see we have 13rd if we are looking for 16th 16th must be
that 16th must be how many 2 remember look in here that is 13rd 13rd 16th must be what 23rd 13rd 13rd you know if you shout if you are talking then it is not my thing i am not kidding i am not kidding why because you are talking see
they do not they did not hear now how many people agree with this group over here all right look look what 110 he said 110
was 10 faces and we say 10
hey come back you got me back you you got me back i got you back you got me back i got you back yeah i got you back all right so listen listen listen how many 10s are in here 1110 look look 1101102
no how many 6 are in here 2616162636 let me see 46 this is 016 and that is that is 2 that is 2
2636263646 am i halfway listen am i 0 i cannot tolerate the way you turn around while we are doing it
no am i halfway here yeah
and then we go 0 no no no no no
it leave it guys leave it it guys let me see people who are paying attention to me my student my learners hold on sit down sit down sit down my friend virginie you are not listening to me virginie michael michael michael michael you are not listening
what direction 1st you need listen let us see cludy good job you leave it leave it because we need this listen what direction now michael is not listening i am losing you them yes that is the way
all right listen all right thank you it now i am going to have these 3 people you listen to what you are going to do god bless now see you will not give me a chance see people are not really listening . thank you
kristen thank you now we are going to go into your your book your book
and in that book i want you to work
few they understood but now i know they are going to kind of be now listen i am going to have people go back to their seat but not everybody all right michael you may go back gerland gerland you may work with michael if you want to
it all right i know all right rudy you are going back to your seat and i am going to send you someone to work with you me now you stay in your seat wait in your seat wegeni in your seat please page one page one page one we are going to omit page one page one
omit what is that page one what does it mean omit omit means leave it one yeah because we have done that before we have done page one you did page one we did page one so we are not going to do page 10 wait a minute we did page one
me you did page one so i want you to go on to page hold on he is not listening page half of a rectangle which page page 5 okay 5 page 5 all right yeah page 5 yeah page 5 all right hold on
fabio fabio 55 unit 6 page 5 good job
6 okay wegeni number 2 please wegeni what fraction is that 14th what is your name wegeni no number one no wegeni what fraction on page 5 number 2 is what fraction what do we call it
wow some people are really not listening that is the thing i know some people can not even look at it and read it
all right now let us look at another person that is really good at it up now the number 3 is too easy yeah yeah number 3 this one sir
this now let let me go into one of the problems on page 9 no no let us go 0 yeah page 6 is one of the problems that i feel dolly could help with one of the problems dolly okay now it says listen let us see people who are looking at one of the problems on page 6
665 do not make 66 very good how about christine 6
now i want people and i am going to walk around and see people who think of this set is 24 and how many pieces let me walk around see people and i see some people are drawing the 24 just like we did it here 0 they just know 0 24
let me see let me see the fraction fraction show it
28 what did we do when what did we do when we need to find the fraction of a set did she is trying and the set has 24 use can we use this that is why i needed you to keep it up
up all right so that is why i needed you to keep it up remember what we did here okay so let us go back to the set of 24 on look look look in here can i go to the bathroom okay all right hold on hold on
we we i have a pencil for people that need to borrow a pencil but listen can i am going to see if this one can help you fabio 24 we had half we had 14th and we had excuse me 18th 18th 18th you are not looking you are not looking see
i will get you back all right see 18th and 28th what do you think 28th might be back that is okay what do you think 28th might be
62 would be the so 28th might be the same 24 how do you know that because because if i know 18th is 328th might be another 3 it might be 666 so now you got me back 3 +3 is 6 i get you yes so 18th is 324
be 624 so 28th might be might be 28th might be 624 624 and do i have 6 up here no you have 3 so 28th is the same as as look at this 2
look at this 2 some people are not looking they do not get it it 28th must be another 18th 18th +18th equal 28th and then 18th and when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see
see when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see yeah 14th and 28th what do i see the same amount the same amount so what do we call 28th and 14th is equal equavalent thank you very much equal so do you see the number
how many pieces 24 now what do we write down for the problem ruby gets ruby gets ruby gets marbles ruby gets 6 marbles 6 marbles do you write a sentence let me see if people write a sentence yeah the sentence is how many marbles does ruby get
u marbles ruby let me see ruby ruby gets 6 marbles do you write it down ruby gets ruby gets 6 marbles ruby gets i like when people put the s ruby gets if you know you can do the 2nd one
0 yeah yeah you could use the equation you do the 2nd one those who know because we are about to finish and then i will let you go back not today but tomorrow 0 my god the floor is half of half the book like was and 3 i will know it
it i will get you back i will get her back so now look at that she is doing number 2 so if you are doing number 2 let me see because we are about to finish and we did a set we did a problem and then we will continue doing those kind of problems with 24 sets good job
quick we are doing the 2nd one number 2 number 2 and then we are about to finish and say what did we learn i learned all right hold on it somebody already do number 2 some people already do number 2 ruby gets how many pieces were you looking when i yeah yeah how many pieces did ruby get
6 all right now do the 2nd one let us see you do the 2nd one see people who do the 2nd one quick later on i have for you he is thinking but too loud now let us see he is working she is working she is thinking he is doing he is already done
maybe he is not good maybe open it and check it
you see okay you are all ready 24 wait a minute 34th 34th of 24 remember we learned about 34th of 20
24 remember we did all that 35 by 3 we did half look look look people that are looking yes i am glad you are looking see that is 14th that is 24th how many pieces
half and 34th 34th is how many
34th is how many how many pieces 8 pieces wait a minute 14th 24th 34th 18 pieces 18 pieces yes yes 0 good we did that before i do not know why you you said it
yes did you guys see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see collection i know how many ethan 0 yeah sentence she gives okay mister
we will we will let you do more problems yeah we will let you do more problems somebody ask him on let me let me stop for a minute look at the ends you now i am going to ask a simple question a simple question to dolly
dolly yeah give me your give me give me your attention do i have you back
yes yes michael i have your back fabio i have your back yes okay all right see he he is talking if i have you back then you are listening not talking nice
one thing if you are ready to say one thing that we learned this morning that you feel strong and i could explain it i could write it in my learner is notebook and i could take it home with me 24 it could be something but all right all right it could be out of a set
it could be any fraction anything right now one thing today and tomorrow i learned about it 0 some people are not listening somebody is sharing some people are not
danny is not listening michael is not listening and abigail is not listening 0 yeah we are about to finish you we are about to finish our lesson and then we need somebody who can tell us a few things we learned simple 0
i i will come to you because i know you have something nice but i do not know if luji luji if you are going to write home about math tomorrow i am going to read it in your book good job yeah what is it what would you tell your mom or dad about what we learned today see he is not listening thank you
yes so yes james i heard that a set of fractions could be divided into many sets of pieces thank you we also learned no hold on
one fact a set of fractions could be learned into many many pieces many pieces and you could tell the fraction but the fraction pieces see you are not really listening alright next one dolly dolly dolly just a minute dolly yes
set one half of a set +one half of a set is equal to the whole thing how about a word equ equivalent equal anybody pick up anything what is equal what fraction is equivalent equivalent equal she does not know
see will i am losing you will now tell me something about equal equivalent yeah wait yeah nixon nixon do not talk to him
ignore yeah 7 half 7 half 7 14 is a to something now anything about equal equal equal equivalent she said 7 14 is equivalent to one 7 14 is equivalent to half one half is i mean 12 over 24
to half half and 13rd is equivalent to hold on hold on let us finish with half now 13rd 13rd is equivalent to .
me she said 0 i can do this can i do more
right so today we are going to work on playing a really cool game called capture fraction but the object of the game is for you to better understand numerators and denominators so the numerator on a fraction is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom
and to understand what does a numerator mean and what does that do in fraction and denominator what does that mean and what does that mean in a fraction and then today we are going to continue to ask you to identify equivalent fractions fractions yeah equal equal so equal equivalent so fractions that are exactly the same who can quickly give me an example of a equivalent of a set of equivalent fractions yeah
2 fourths and a half 2 fourths and a half excellent so we have 24th and a half they are equivalent that means that they are the same they have the same value or they have the same shade and places and then today you are going to put them in order where you compare a fraction
and you have to use a series of thinking and thinking about equivalence and relationship to tell me how to understand what is bigger than the other sense okay so you are going to actually explain while you are playing the game understand what is numerator and denominator share how your strategies and how you figure out how things are equivalent and also explain how you put things in order when you compare fractions
right so what i have here is 2 fractions 1st okay 14th and 3 fifths in it in the game then what we are going to play is figure out who is bigger which is a larger which is a bigger one okay so you have 14th and 3 fifths which fraction is bigger
numbers i know 4 times 3 equals 121 times 5 equals 5 huh so 3 fifths is bigger 3 fifths is bigger is that do you agree that it is is that what you said okay so can you tell me if there is another way that you can figure out which one is bigger
idea but i want to go back to to think about what amy just said so she said well you only ate one whereas you ate 3 here one this one ate 3 is that a fair way to think about it 0 i know if you cross across the middle it will be 245 but is this one the same
so for example if i were to take this one and i apologize my drawing is not very good equal but if this this one is it the same as much as this one
know because the square one that looked like a square but that looked like a rectangle yeah big rectangle okay if you take one as 15th and you say the denominator is bigger than the it is small okay so you have 15th and then you have 14th so because you had to split more where the denominator is bigger then that is why 15th is actually smaller than 14th
so knowing that how so you have to be conscious about that this one and this one are totally different think 14th i think 14th 14th is bigger
because last time you said the bigger number the the smaller pieces you get when you eat less you get more pieces but when you eat more you get less pieces it is like the denominator it has more you eat less when the denominator is greater you eat more you only have like 2 left and when the denominator is smaller you have more left okay does everyone agree in here
yeah wonderful all right so i heard some interesting way of finding out which one is greater 1st anthony 3 fifths is bigger how do you know 3 fifths is bigger because 4 times 3 is 12
okay team one that you want to change it . okay so can you tell me what you did
4 times 3 is 12 and 3 times 5 is 5 like 44 equals one whole and there is 15 and then there is one
then yeah then tell me why you would agree with him if you were telling me that he forgot to times to multiply by 5 in here
what do you think i think like you skipped me think because what anthony did is interesting he multiplied 5 times one to make 5 and then 4 times 3 makes 12
this so i guess my question to you is when you did this just say this part right here you changed you totally changed the value of 14th i do not know how 14th is equivalent to 5 fourths do you know what i mean about and what junhong was saying well junhong can you tell us what you were doing you were trying to do here
i mean like he just did like one he just times the numerator in there but he did not times the denominator okay so he did not need to do if he times the denominator so he did not need to do this one okay so you think that he just skipped one step anthony i mean he changed a step he changed the value of 14th he just like if he you had to speak a little louder
if he times the denominator it would be like it would be the same denominator okay so you are looking for the same denominator so it would be 520 and then the other one would be this and then you would see that since can you tell me that then since they have the same denominator then you can compare it
0 does that make sense good job thank you all right with someone else with a different strategy how did you figure out whether or not 14th is greater than 3 fifths well there were some interesting things that were happening here me you know what since you do not want to talk about it i will bring it up
okay so earlier this team were having a very interesting conversation they were talking about well what is left over part and they say and do you want to continue tell me what you just you said no okay so they were saying that there is a lot more left over versus this
so you have 3 fourths left over and amy how much do you have left over here 2 fifths 2 fifths and she is saying that 3 fourths is greater than 2 fifths then that means yesterday we talked about when you have left over the more you eat the less you have left huh the less you eat the more you have left right
yep when we eat candies or brownies or whatever a huge slice a huge pizza so how much the more you eat the less you have left the less you eat the more you have left but then there was a conversation that you guys you both team had that was a little was quite interesting and we i feel that we should talk about
one some of you are saying well this one ate one and this one ate 3 bigger why is why should it not be that way shuxian because the denominator is not the same the denominator is not the same what does that mean when the denominator is not the same
kenny it is not cut into the same pieces it is not cutting into the same pieces job so when the pieces are not the same i could have 14th of something but if i cut something into 5 pieces and i tell you that i eat all 5 of them even though my denominator is bigger but i actually ate more because i ate more pieces
sense so there are a couple of ways of thinking about solving figure out how one is bigger than the other have this one do you do you want me to erase some of them it is this 100 yeah 0 yeah remember let me out of your way
joyce because the denominator is 4 the denominator is 4 pieces and junhong is now doing i am trying to figure out what junhong is doing right now he is doing the that is okay
p m g what is p m g okay like on the mcat where it says where is p where is m okay
okay so kenny can you tell us what you were trying to tell him guess okay so tell me how junhong would should draw it then
01 if you try to cut it in 4 to make it equal what should the 1st thing you do half right and then how do we find 14th half of half half of half and then half of half of half so 3 fourths right
here it is hard to see when your line is not exactly the same or my square is not exactly the same us so we have the same thing 0 and 11 how many parts do i need to cut it
155 because i have 3 fifths so it is 14th and we need to do 3 fifths so we can not so we know that if i do half right here okay just to keep a gauge as to where things are so i know that 15th 25th are less than half and 35th is it less or more than half
half so you can kind of play with it a little bit and just try to be a little bit try to make sure that it kind of stays within the same amount of increments here so that can help you to see that 3 fifths is longer than 14th bigger than 14th does that make sense
myself all right so there are quite a few ways that you boys and girls can think that up to help you to figure out which is greater so you can do what anthony was doing earlier going to crisscross and that magic rule that you guys like using denominator that means they share the same denominator so you can compare it
about look at what is left to help you to figure out which is greater strategies so that is what we are talking about using the equivalence and the reasoning with equivalence and relationship to help you to figure out which is greater and which is less no okay so today you are going to play a game called capture fraction
deck so basically what you are going to do is kind of shuffle the card and you on your 1st do not try to pick out and then you have to see who is greater
if you have a greater like this fraction yeah okay so whoever has the most number of cards on the end wins like on page 33 in unit 6
on page 33 it says finding equivalent fractions when you are there anytime that you find a fraction that is equivalent that means the same thing the same value then you write that down so for example half is equivalent to 4 eighths then you would write half equals 4 eighths so when you find another fraction set a fraction or that are equivalent then you should write it down to keep track of it
now if you happen to have a card that you are equivalent then you both keep your own card no yes andrew but just we will figure it out can we split it if your partner does not have his or her cards then yeah if you do not mind splitting it that would be great yeah what if you could just put that in the deck over here at the point that is a good point
if you have a card that is equivalent you know what let me see you should get a c d that the equivalent card so for example shuxian and i have a set of cards that are equivalent out whoever at the end has the greater one gets all of them 0
that is right sorry my fault does that make sense so if i have half she has a half then it is equivalent then we take out the next card and if hers is mine is one whole her is 13rd then i win sense any time you find any card that is equivalent write it down any question of what you need to do okay who can tell me what we are going to do
time andrew shuffle it 1st shuffle it 1st what yeah like talking like you put one card and your partner put one card if you both have equivalent you keep it
what you write it down on your piece of paper and then you fill up another card and see whosever is bigger whoever has is bigger will get all 4 cards right because you have 2 cards that are equivalent and then 2 more cards that are out there right and whoever has the most cards has more cards at the end will win now junhong and shuxian are like 0 my goodness i need to write my name on all of them so but i think you kind of recognize your own handwriting i hope
but if you can quickly write your initial on your card then that is fine too bit if you are ready let the game begin yay does tiffany get it
it but if it is not equivalent then you fill out the next word if it is equivalent then you hold it and then you fill out the next card out that was the whole point of the game then you whoever is greater than all of them
0 now make sure you have that conversation with your partner as to how do you know that is greater or less or equivalent 18 i have the biggest one so do i keep it
okay put it down so she he can look at it too 23 foreign language 812 foreign language and then i did 16 sorry right give me 12nd foreign language yeah
i am putting it in 2 yeah 36312 alex are these your cards do you do you split it
i can not find mine i will give you a little what like how 0 okay but how do you know that yours is bigger because the denominator is smaller 0 smaller right and the p then the piece you got to pick up
mean it means like if you like for example if i like ate 2 so let us use this as an example since you have it right here bigger this 123rd why do you think so
size mine are smaller so if you look at this as one what is left over is 13rd yeah so could the piece then are the pieces the same size then
no so you can not so i i do not think it would be accurate to say that this has 2 pieces and that is 4 pieces because this portion is a lot smaller i mean the size is different so imagine if i if i say to you anthony i am giving you a piece of cake this much
cake he still gets one piece but it is this big right so just saying that one piece would not be a fair way to explain it because the size portion is very different so because of the denominator right
so using that think about again who is greater so if you want i i think correct me if i am wrong but what i am hearing you saying that you are focusing on this part right here right because you ate 4 pieces and i ate 2 pieces so you have more and you have less
me 2321 think about how much do you have left 1st you have 13rd left here and 6 tenths left okay now you are really comparing 13rd and 6 tenths now right okay me how do you know which is greater why
18 over 10
10 we had that concept before so you are doing the crisscross right here so you are doing 13rd and 6 tenths right and then you go 3 tenths and 6 eighteenths and that is why this is bigger right that is just a way to prove it but i need you to understand it
what does that mean you can play another round did you find any equivalents 10 no 0202 what do you think
16th okay so let us try it this way all right so you have 13rd left you have 46th left there is 13rd left half of something
no no okay so look at 46 okay 5 so that means what you have left over is more than 5 half in this one you have left over which is less than half then that reverse row again so if i have less left over that means i have more
and then you have more left over and that means you ate less far and then we i talked about well i know that 13rd is less than a half half
right and 6 tenths i know half of the 10 is 5 and i have 6 of them half i can actually just erase it and put it right here right all right i have more than half left over that so there were a couple of things we did all together
over any relationship with half right so try that with the other cards to see if that strategy those strategies work right or that would be a $5 challenge can you try again yeah hey deanne what is up
no we do not have any points what do you need honey i did not find any no equivalents no
okay let us play again then shuffle the card and play again how are we doing over here did you guys find any equivalents yeah 16th equals to 21286th equals to 14th 86th equals to one half interesting and you know and you can prove it right see amy can you prove this one to me
i have how do you know 36th equals to 3 because 33 +3 equals to 6 so it is a half so it is equal to okay what do you because the numerator is it is a half of the so it works all the time that way
me how is 86th equivalent to one and 14th 0 can i try it yeah when you are in doubt just draw it out
luis we have none of this they found it it is just your luck we do not have to shuffle it again okay shuffle it
okay so tell me what is happening i drew like 46th because this is the denominator excellent so but this is right in the middle so i used another 6 and then i have to color 8 pieces
whole and this is 2 over 60 so in fraction what does this think of right or you can think of it as 13rd right
yeah so you have one whole and 26th or 13rd this yesterday you were having such a tough time and today you are like this is easy this is easy as pie great but we just you know what by drawing it you just proved it right so 86th is not equivalent to one and 14th when you are in doubt draw it out
here too bad hey i need to hear some conversation going on here people equivalent i am so sad she could not think how to wash my small pot and the small pot can wash it with just milk i am so sad
how do you know see how do you know she could not look that is why you guys are like speeding through this it how do i even reach one alex i love it but too much sorry i was a little distracted she got 2
yeah 0 i love that 0 too shuxian tell me what is happening it one and 14th and 5 thirds 5 thirds right aha
it instead of doing that crisscross like one and 14th 14th and 2 thirds so one and one is 52 thirds now 2 thirds and 14th yeah and so .
22 times 2 equals 11 times 3 equals 3 say that again 2 3 times what it is like this yeah but can you just multiply the denominator and then figure out that is the answer what i do not understand why you did that
me because the teacher taught me
that do you use that too when you are finding out the answer no in yeah way equivalent 0 sorry
something like we are one of them is the same but then and then we can did you use the strategies that you guys were talking about looking at what is left over and do all that crazy math and then figure it out because you know why anthony 0 yes we have the same thing all the time all the time
it 0 whoever is next is going to get all 6 of them what if we have like the same thing then you have the same thing how is this equivalent explain that to me i feel like i am never here this this one is equivalent 0 we are looking for equivalent 0
so we are not looking for one which is greater than the last one so do we you can not just grab it why so do we have the i am just putting like 3 no you need to say take out another card and see who is bigger
okay how is this the same though 0 okay because you took the that card out it which one is bigger sorry he took he is taking all of them 0 you really really do not know
is tell me how will you go how are you going to go about to figure it out i will do it right so excuse me i am working with another group you in the meantime why do not you you can figure out what think of all the strategies that we talked about
it i got another one all right tell me what you are thinking i think can i write it on here 0
so you do the crisscross right yes all right tell me another one tiffany what do you think okay team one and team 2 i love that you love the game but quiet down a little bit would you no team 2 and 3 sorry 456
here where would you put 2 sixths we have 2 eighths right here why because the denominator is less than the 4 but you have 2 of them no but i just put them right here 0 sorry i asked you where 16th is did not i
that it is like playing cards it is likes playing cards okay good do you see what she did
parts 14th on the 1st line she drawed it as 14th line she cut it in 6 equal parts and then she had 2 sixths okay yeah i am going to use this 0 half right and here you have half
it then now you have so you can totally figure it out so they are exactly the same this this is 14th this is 16th so which is greater 14th so that means this part 8 more
right so this must be less than that less than 8 all right all right owner 00 so take your own card
please i do not have i do not have 64
i only have one if you are ready eyes on me so i know you are ready one thank you . all right okay ready so can someone share with me what was your strategy
what did you do to help you figure out whether or not your card is bigger than your partner is card andrew i used 2 ways one is to put the card in one of the number lines okay so for example i think your card was 14th and 2 sixths right camera sorry sorry sorry so can you just tell us what you did
this close and 4 times 2 equals 8 okay and 6 times one equals 6 so i because the the 8 is bigger than 6 so that means 2 sixths is bigger excellent all right
oops thumbs up if you have tried using this strategy while you were working on figuring out who is greater who is not okay good most of you and then the other strategy the number line i got one number line and i split it into 4 equal parts okay i noticed that you were very good about putting 0 and one earlier so i want to make sure i put that there
so that is and the other side i do it the same way so kind of less than 3 fourths so that would be 3 sixths it will be 4 sixths and then a little bit more than 5 sixths am i correct but given my portions are not exactly the same but it should be
so and this is 2 sixths so this is how far 2 sixths is no but again the importance of drawing your portions to try to be the same so that if i draw 14th like this but then if i i am sorry if i do 14th like this and then my 2 sixths is like this well of course 14th will be a lot longer than 2 sixths right here
right so your line needs to be about the same if you can okay excellent someone else with a different strategy strategies so we will call it the crisscross how do you spell crisscross c r 0 s s criss cross
applesauce and then do we do the number line do the times one the what times one
did michael what did junhong do
242 times 4 makes 8 so can you tell me what he is trying to do here he is drawing a line okay you are telling me what he did but can you tell me what is his strategy
that yeah but why is he doing all that work michelle to make the both denominator same 0
so he is looking for the same denominator then he can compare just the numerator okay denominator so the same denominator does that make sense numerator so another strategy is the common denominator good okay any questions for junhong no
0 why do not the 3 of us kind of explain what we did right so you have 14th and again the importance of trying to draw the shape the same the same the whole is about the same size so it is easier to see
so well and tiffany and andrew and i we also used a similar actually the same strategy so what do we focus on when you have something like this yeah how many is left focus on the leftover portion so here i have 3 fourths left over and here i have 4 sixths left over
what okay xin or anyone else
she does not just put the 2 of them . all right anyone no time so we have 3 fourths left over over so we talk about the relationship with other fractions
so here i know they are going to be upset that i used green but i am going to fill this in over this is the same thing so the one thing that is different that is left is that one whole sorry this is 16th this is 14th left over
compare 14th and 16th because i took care of the half already right they both i took care of that so i do not have to worry about that because they are exactly the same left now because the numerator is the same then we can go back and think about well one out of 4 pieces one out of 6 pieces
right now then i know that 3 fourths is bigger than 4 sixths so then we go back to that idea over the less i eat the more i have left over so because i have more left over then that means that i must eat less
smaller and since here i have less left over so this must be bigger does that make sense so again thinking about using the relationship you have the fractions have amongst each other
sense okay okay so tomorrow we will have i think we should talk a little bit about more about this strategy right so and the relationship between one fraction to another to help us to figure things out use what you know
we always say use what you know to help you solve what you do not know cards for those of you who left your fraction cards at home please bring them back tomorrow all right no the 4 strategies we talk about is crisscross you are working on the number line finding the common denominators and focusing on the left overs
i think we are pretty most of us are pretty comfortable using the crisscross i think we should develop focus a little bit more on the other 3 and especially i love this one where we actually the more you are able to manipulate the numbers and the fraction the easier that means that your understanding of fraction is even deeper line and you might find one that is most efficient for you any question
no we did not get a chance to talk about the equivalent fraction 35 which is larger which is larger 2 thirds or 32s use word to rehab sorry
answer earlier michelle and amy were trying to tell me something that is equivalent and then amy was like may i draw it answer so when you are in doubt draw it out okay
mister jones now listen carefully right this morning we will continue exploring exploring fractions
fraction we are only revising a few things before we get into the practice fractions now fabio could you tell us something about fraction when you are thinking fraction yes one half is the biggest one half is the biggest fraction good so we put the word biggest greatest larger
comparing so you are kind of comparing or ordering thing another 118th is the smallest one for which one this 18th was the smallest but that is not the smallest fraction there is more low but 18th was the one we did for the set
set so we did fraction of an area fraction of a set fraction of a group minutes that is why i have you all together here so we could look at it and explore more and go deeper and then go in the practice in your book
page i am going to put them on the board the page that i would like you to work with a partner when we finish know and some people i already kind of know but i am going to walk around and see how do you integrate the practice we did i mean the lesson we introduced and i put a few posters up there about fraction
yesterday and we talked about right somebody yeah numerator numerator and a denominator there is always say can i see you still yeah when we say numerator or denominator tell me something about denominator naila naila
represent what does when you see the denominator what do i have in mind the whole process the whole thing everything everything of the fraction that means the whole area or the whole group or the whole set it is the denominator like i have 3 fractions up there
i have 3 i have and then hold on half and i have 58th i mean 510th and i have 24 halves but we could tell 510th and 10 is the .
idea all right now i bring this part too i bring i bring this part that show you the whole many how many in this fraction one half 2 whole see it is 2 but it is 2 halves right and then we have the whole again from 0
it is a fraction line from 0 half to one half and then 222 halves 2 halves yes 2 halves all right see one if we want to divide it the whole in in let me wait for all in yep nixon and michael and michael yes
and michael so if i want to divide my my whole into halves or if i want to divide my whole in 4 people yeah so this is my whole this is 14th 24th which is the same as .
one half thank you and i have 34th which is the same as one half 1213rd yeah 14th i am going like this one half 13rd kind of close to 13rd but it is kind of
close 3 fourths is kind of almost 4 fourths almost so it is very close to 4 fourths which is the whole thing because i break it into 4 pieces and i could do the same here for 5
and if i have my whole and i go into happened so i have 15th 2 fifths 3 fifths 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 5 fifths so which is closer excuse me
which is closer 334th and 45th or 34th and 35th which which one is closer 34th . which one is closer together similar closer together 34th could you maybe put your that is it 34th 35th 34th and 35th or 34th and 45th 34th are they almost both of .
whole yeah they kind of almost right and then we are looking into 8th that is the 8th 8th the 8th and then see 4th become 8 which name 4th become become 8th if i want to put my whole into smaller fraction
8th right then if i want to go that same half i want to put it in 5th me when i am looking right here look look look i put that 55th right here 55th and i am lining it up with the .
half so what are we doing see i look we have the vocabulary up there equivalent small group group we we did the group before but now we are going to go over it again
before i send you into the practice in your book with the pattern
up you may go and fix it for me please what thank you thank you thanks good job
again christine i need your attention the day before this is what we did and that is why we revised it on the poster when i put the poster up when i put the poster up so people are able are able to look at what we are those posters that i put up so people are kind of looking 0 we did this
but we are going to do it for a group all right look again look look
see we take the group and we you remember we had a half half in half all right then we said half of this group we did the half this way and we did it that way also
way all right we did half the 2 different ways way and we decided we decided or 121224 because we know for . equivalent the rectangle
equivalent all right so 12 24 is half of this fraction or this set or this group group let me wait for rudy me thank you all right next one come here all right next one
we were going to 14th 14th of that half or we could decide we decided we decided 4th or 4th of that same set is .
is 6 is 6 pieces and it is out of the whole thing which is 24 and 14th we put it right there the equivalent of for this set which is 24 is thank you 6 yeah so 14th
how many how many of this how many 4th is of half yeah 66 but another word for this 4th is what half half of what half of the half of the half half of the half is 6
half of the half is 14th that is what we were looking into again and let us continue this anybody anybody anybody you need to raise raise your hand please let me go into luji luji
fraction only luji 14th now how many 4th of this one luji 4th wait a minute
2 34th 34th 34th is this 14th 24th 34th 0 i could do it this way
0 and what do i have here that is shaded 34th 34th and that this is not 24th but this is 34th 34th of the whole set is shaded
this was 6 but i have 3 of these it 81219 she is not even looking
are i know if ludi was looking she would be the 1st one telling me naila chrislene chrislene can you yeah thank you now chrislene i have 14th here which is 624
now 34th must be how many pieces chrislene 4 yeah now i have your back there i have 14th look 14th is 6 pieces of the whole set
you 34th is how many of the whole set 18180 my god yes well okay but they did not get it
too see you were able to get it but some wait a minute one yes camille the question is for you
yes if anybody want to help camille they can raise their hand down i am going down so the fraction is going one half 14th and this one become .
set what do i read this fraction it is half of 14th pieces you people are not really paying attention the same word odd numbers but they are not really looking jimmy i know it is one and .
me 0 samantha is really there because we have done this before me now somebody now i have naila back now naila can you explain why do we call this 18th yeah why do we call this 18th because . look at this one and look at this one
why do we call this 18th okay why do we call this 18th 0 somebody is ready naila can you explain yes sir yes with . thank you so 3 and . that is why we call it another name an equivalent of this one
324324 which is equivalent to 18th for this set listen i am going to erase this and i need people is attention because i am going to ask you another question we never talked about before
yes we have 13rd we have 13rd i mean we have one half we have 14th
me 0 yeah that same set and how many is in this set 24 so we know 3 pieces is how many fraction 3 pieces 3 pieces is what fraction 18th 18th of the whole set and that is 324
clean thank you thank you very much it is hard to it is hard to keep it up learn no wakudowali let us go wakudowali right michael what else did we learn we learned 18th let us go back
back one more fraction we learned with the whole set
wow okay half we will put one half and one half must be this way okay 0 that one half is 1224
right another fraction we learned for the set yes 14th and we put them in order and that 14th must be
okay all right so that is what what do we call it equivalent 624th 624th i have you back listen this is a new question and people need to think people need to think sandwich half of my sandwich is 12 pieces out of 20 .
sandwich remember we said this is considered as a sandwich that i am eating now 14th if i decide to eat a 4th of my sandwich it would be 6 pieces out of 24 now if i decide to eat 13rd 13rd of my sandwich how many pieces would that be
you need to think and i am letting people think hm and i am letting people think and then i will say you know hold on
talk to your friend and say i want 13rd of my 13rd of my 8 pieces all right excuse me 13rd of my 24 pieces
good rudy is talking over there i am looking for 13rd i want to eat 13rd how many pieces would that be pieces well jamie you may talk to anyone yeah yeah whistling you may get into that talking
saying when i raise my hand i am going to raise my hand in a minute pieces 13rd yeah a 3rd of my sandwich i am eating only a 3rd how many pieces would that be
13rd no sorry 4 okay back back back no no no no
212 somebody somebody is waiting i am nixon collins collins darlene good job listen i am going to ask one person and if it is if you find that same answer do not tell me what to do please all right now if it is listen
darlene now if it is the same answer we got to that person what do we do leave it out there yes yes all right now rudy i am always calling your name and i know you very yes all right now what was the answer how many .
how many pieces would it be in what fraction numerator and denominator now let me wait for camille camille how many pieces we said 13rd of this set
one some people are not listening some people were not listening talking excuse me nixon do not do that
nixon so i hear 3 people were talking and i heard the answer kind of but i was not sure right nixon what did you talk me about i said we said we said we talked about yeah we talked about listen listen girls girls yeah we said 12 over 24
is half yes yeah and then we are going to see the 13rd yeah 13rd must be be 13rd of this set must be 13rd i am going to find this and i .
okay that is what you talked about right yeah now let me go to another group listen if it is your answer you need to go yes but if it is not then you need to say 0 how
how hold on
listen we are looking for how many pieces would be 13rd how many pieces would be 13rd 18th why do you say 18th we already know 18th is 3 pieces 06 it is 3 pieces 123 and we know 15th is 6 pieces now we are looking for 13rd 0 wow and using the same strategy
listen michael yes michael calm down all right listen why is 18th somebody was telling me yesterday okay all right so 8 x 3 is 24
on i am showing you something very important 4 times 6 is 24 and that is why we see 0 this is 14th we transfer what we have learned before into the fraction 12 times 12 is 24 and that is how we know half is 24
now can we use that strategy to get 13rd maybe what can we do to get 13rd what can we time 3 times 83 times equal 24 that tells us how many pieces 8 pieces not 18th 8 pieces that is what i asked you how many pieces would be 13rd hold on
said i heard you were saying that but you missed kind of you go with 18th 18th is something different to a fraction you know what listen i am trying to kind of help you understand the way you said it and the way you told me is different
see 123456785678 so let us see book so this is what we call 13rd and how many pieces is that
8 good 53rd so now how many 8 look
yes so 18th 18th 18th how many 8th how many 8th how many 8th 6 you are not looking
see 18th 18th 18th how many 8th 33 times 824 so the fraction for 18th another way an equivalent fraction would be is it 324 or 824824 because it is 8 pieces we call it 320 .
pieces 328 no but if i have the whole thing is 24 aha 3 look look we said 13rd is 624 so this one must be how many pieces 888 pieces so 824 is the same equivalent to .
324 is the same equivalent to 13rd of this you yep all right yes now any questions let me see people that has questions regarding regarding regarding the fraction of this set
set now if i have 16th i mean 13rd 13rd becomes 16th because half of 3 is 6 be the smart people let me call see the smart people excuse me
pieces so 82416th must be 44240 you all getting it
see so this one is equal same thing as 4 24 24 now i get you luji do i really get you back yes you get this piece yes when i say 16th must be because 13rd is 824
so if i go 16th must be e times e see what we are doing we are matching facts time factors equals factors equal product we are kind of combining a lot of the learning we have done before
area the denominator i see some people are not paying attention so what i am going to do and i will go to 13rd 16th and one 18th 112th no 14th 112th 118th 0
yes why do you say 112th if i am going down 13rd 16th 112th what would it be had 84th yeah she gets it
it becomes 2 if i go 112th equals 2 oops sorry 224th 124th 124th 124th is what one 148th 148th okay
job i like that all right now another one and then we will go into our book practice now remember we went into a different different set set we went into 13rd for this set set people that are looking with me
see 13rd of this set let me see 13rd let me make it 13rd some people those guys on my left good are smart are smart
back fine now listen carefully listen we have a different different set which is we were looking for see this one tells us how many in our set
so it is 60 we did that the day before or yesterday so it is 13rd is .
yes now i see some people are looking some people are talking and some people see those people that are talking they will not be able to do is all right hold on hold on let us wait for the talking so i can do a little bit of it and guide it to chrisline my favorite job all right so 13rd see this is a 3rd
that is right 13rd +13rd equals 2 and 2 thirds of the whole set guys okay and they call themselves the smartest you got back me
listen 13rd 23rd can i have 16th yeah 16th yes
see if you start shouting it is not good see now he is talking 16th now see we have 13rd if we are looking for 16th 16th must be see some people 0 now they are getting smarter let me see if they are talking together chrisline luji and naila
and we need people 5 there can not be you know 16th 16th there has to be 15th 16th if we have 13rd we could have 16th yeah i know yeah so how many pieces would that be that 16th must be how many 2 remember look in here that is 13rd 13rd 16th must be what
23rd 13rd 13rd you know if you shout if you are talking then it is not my thing i am not kidding i am not kidding why talking see they do not they did not hear
now how many people agree with this group over here look what did they say 16 must be what 110 he said 110 no
was 10 faces and we say 10 hey come back
you got me back you you got me back i got you back you got me back i got you back yeah i got you back all right so listen listen listen how many 10s are in here one
look 1101102 no how many 6 are in here 2616162636 let me see 016 and that is that is 2
that is 22636263646 am i halfway listen am i 0 i cannot tolerate the way you turn around while we are doing it here yeah so 36 must be .
368368 is the same equivalent yes and then we go 0 no no no no no
look 16th 26th 36th 46th 46th 76th 56th 106th 6th 76th 56th 106th 6th 66th 060 over . 06060th all right now wow
0 marco you know how to do it it did i say it guys let me see people who are paying attention to me
on sit down sit down sit down my friend virginie you are not listening to me virginie michael michael michael michael you are not listening what direction 1st
job darlene thank you leave it leave it because we need this darlene you are not sitting and listen direction now michael is not listening i am losing you
listen all right thank you good job now that is how i need it
now we are going to go into your your book your book and in that book i want you to work page page one huh listen i will tell you which page page 13 i am going to put them on the board page 1356 and maybe we will get a chance to do a few problems
and the problems are on page 79 and 10 but we will do about 3 okay all right 5 and 6 and 6 all right so i am going to let you work for 10 minutes on this one because some people already did a few of them yeah few they understood but now i know they are going to kind of be now listen
i am going to have people go back to their seat but not everybody all right michael you may go back gerland gerland you may work with michael if you want to but if you all right now i am going to walk around and see know all right rudy you are going back to your seat and i am going to send you someone to work with you excuse me
now you stay in your seat wait in your seat wegeni in your seat please page one page one page 11 we are going to omit what is that page one what does it mean omit omit means leave it
leave page one yeah because we have done that before we have done page one you did page one me you did page one so i want you to go on to page hold on
he is not listening page half of a rectangle which page page 5 okay 5 page 5 all right yeah page 5 yeah page 5 all right hold on
and some people have done it and it is easy right yes 55 good job 5 nixon number one please
one page 5 fabio fabio 55 unit 6 page 5 good job
please wegeni what fraction is that 14th what is your name wegeni no number one no wegeni what fraction on page 5 number 2 is what fraction what do we call it
wow some people are really not listening that is the thing look how many what is the denominator the whole thing the whole thing
up good job up now the number 3 is too easy yeah yeah number 3 this one sir thank you
bad you are messing it up now chris you did so well in this now let let me go into one of the problems on page 90 no no let us go 0 yeah
page 6 is one of the problems that i feel dolly could help with one of the problems dolly okay now it says listen let us see people who are looking at one of the problems on page 66 on page 6665 do not make 6 michael 6 yes yes good job
6 very good us ethan has 24 marbles thank you
about i am done he gives 28 of his collection to his sister ruby how many marbles does ruby get see the question is always they give you the set and they give you the fraction and they ask you how many pieces that is what i have been asking you
now i want people and i am going to walk around and see people who think of this set is 24 and how many pieces let me walk around see people and i see some people are drawing the 24 just like we did it here 24 let me see
let me see the fraction fraction show it many 28 what did we do when what did we do when we need to find the fraction of a set
did she is trying and the set has 24 how did we use can we use this that is why i needed you to keep it up see up all right so that is why i needed you to keep it up remember what we did here okay so let us go back to the set of 24
on look look look in here can i go to the bathroom okay all right hold on hold on we we i have a pencil for people that need to borrow a pencil listen can i am going to see if this one can help you fabio
24 we had half we had 14th and we had excuse me 18th 18th 18th you are not looking looking see
see 18th and 28th what do you think 28th might be 62 would be the so 28th might be the same .
24 how do you know that because because if i know 18th is 328th might be another 3 it might be 666 so now you got me back 3 +3 is 6 i get you yes so 18th is 324
be 624 so 28th might be might be 28th might be 624 624 and do i have 6 up here no you have 3 so 28th is the same as as 28th is the same as .
look at this 2 look at this 2 some people are not looking they do not get it see we did it up here we said i knew it 28th must be another 18th 18th +18th equal 28th and then 18th and when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see it is only one
minute what do i see when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see people are not looking 8 yeah 14th and 28th what do i see amount so what do we call 28th and 14th is equal equavalent thank you very much equal so do you see the number
how many pieces 24 now what do we write down for the problem ruby gets ruby gets ruby gets marbles ruby gets 6 marbles 6 marbles do you write a sentence let me see if people write a sentence yeah the sentence is how many marbles does ruby get 6 ruby gets 6 marbles no that is a u
ruby ruby gets 6 marbles do you write it down gets ruby gets 6 marbles ruby gets s ruby gets if you know you can do the 2nd one
0 yeah yeah you could use the equation you do the 2nd one those who know because we are about to finish and then i will let you go back not today but tomorrow 0 my god the floor is half of half the book like was and 3 i will know it back i will get her back so now look at that
she is doing number 2 so if you are doing number 2 let me see because we are about to finish and we did a set we did a problem and then we will continue doing those kind of problems job quick we are doing the 2nd one number 2 number 2 and then we are about to finish and say what did we learn
2 some people already do number 2 ruby gets how many pieces were you looking when i get 66 all right now do the 2nd 11 see people who do the 2nd one quick later on i have .
he is thinking loud now let us see
it check it out yes it ah i am glad i told you see okay you are all ready 24 wait a minute 34th 34th of 24
remember we learned about 34th of 20 be 24 that 35 by 3 we did half look look look people that are looking yes
see that is 14th that is 24th how many pieces half and 34th 34th is how many 34th is how many how many pieces 8 pieces wait a minute
14th 24th 34th 18 pieces 18 pieces yes yes yes did you guys see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see
many ethan 0 yeah sentence mister jones got me back got me back the sentence sentence ethan gets 18 toys toys
down i wrote a rubric he said rubric gets 8 cards he said he can get 18 cards open it so we can see it we will we will let you do more problems yeah we will let you do more problems somebody ask him
one more one more hold on on let me let me stop for a minute
you now i am going to ask a simple question a simple question to dolly yes yes michael i have your back
okay all right see he he is talking if i have you back then you are listening not talking nice now orleans yeah give me one thing we learned during this time of math this morning
what did we learn remember what we were you know remember our objective for the for the week for the week for the week all right remember this one here
down finding student will be able to find fraction part of a group or any area in the num meaning of numerator and denominator thank you very much now i see michael warren really listening yes maybe he could tell me one thing now .
one thing one thing thing if you are ready to say one thing that we learned this morning that you feel strong and i could explain it i could write it in my learner is notebook and i could take it home with me
24 it could be something but all right all right it could be out of a set thing today and tomorrow i learned about it listening somebody is sharing some people are not
listening and abigail is not listening 0 yeah we are about to finish thank you we are about to finish our lesson and then we need somebody who can tell us a few things we learned simple
let us 12 yeah go ahead today i learned the fraction of a set and i learned that danny danny danny is the whole set of a fraction thank you very much thing one fact about fractions what we learn the denominator is the whole set number or the number in the set
i i will come to you because i know you have something nice luji luji if you are going to write home about math tomorrow i am going to read it in your book good job yeah what is it what would you tell your mom or dad about what we learned today
yes so yes so yes james i heard that a set of fractions could be divided into many sets of pieces thank you
on one fact a set of fractions could be learned into many many pieces many pieces and you could tell the fraction but the fraction pieces see you are not really listening now today i learnt that no say it louder today we learn how to add fractions add
set one half of a set +one half of a set is equal to the whole thing equ equivalent equal anybody pick up anything what is equal
what fraction is equivalent equivalent equal she does not know see will i am losing you will now tell me something about equal equivalent yeah okay wait
yeah nixon nixon
go ignore yeah 7 half 7 half 7 14 is a equal is equal to to half equal to something now anything about equal equal equal equivalent she said 7 14 is equivalent to .
half i got one i got one 7 14 is equivalent to half one half is i mean 12 over 2406 over 12 is equal to
half half and 13rd is equivalent to half now 13rd 13rd is equivalent to equivalent 262613rd is equivalent to 262 pieces out of 6 pieces we have got your back all right i have got your back all right now listen carefully listen listen
for those of you that were paying attention and i know those people who they are they are ready to do more problems me she said 0 i can do this can i do more now i am going to give you about one minute 2 no wait a minute one minute to work on the problem but this is the end of our lesson for today
way water bottles put them on the floor put them on the floor caleb please come sit here come sit here 0 my god maddie why do not you sit here
okay we are going to practice modeling multiplying and dividing decimals by another decimal that i would rather you not do markers
good okay just put them on the back counter for right now
here okay okay
clicker all right so on your math journal write how do you model a multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
model everybody needs to have their question down question is on the board ryan
you are putting in front of how do you model multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
okay you should be close to being done so that i can switch the screen okay pencils are down when you are done so i know i can move on
okay tell me how multiplying a decimal by a decimal will be similar to money caleb because money is a decimal or a fraction of a dollar okay because quarters or are those dimes these are dimes
i a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths okay so a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths which is ¢10 right yes okay okay so how would my what would my multiplication problem look like to show this answer
write a 10th times a 10th because i have how many dimes is a dollar okay good
one how would i write write the multiplication problem for this on your paper
shane 110th times 5 times 5 which is going to equal what $0.504 times decimals it is 50 what one show that number of cents with quarters quarters caleb now is not the time
answer i want to see the number of cents so what is my number of cents
ryan 25 hundredths . huh 5 good 25 hundredths times 3 equals 75 hundredths 75 hundredths okay now we are going to look at a decimal by a decimal
so i want you on the graph paper that i gave you i want you to show me the model give me a decimal ryan 52 hundredths 52 hundredths yeah okay so you are going to show 52 hundredths times give me a number
elika 33 tenths yes okay so 52 we can not do 52 though we have to do 50 for right now yet 50 hundredths times 3 tenths so model that on your paper graph do not worry about where it says decimal fraction simplified
chart you can use crayons
it you are modeling it
model so 50 hundredths times 3 tenths what would that look like as a model 50 hundredths what is 50 hundredths show me 50 hundredths on your model here
like okay so what does 5 tenths look like in blue and yellow works best
best because you can see the color you can see the color change what you do not have to use those colors see i like the way sawyer is turned out
there okay so nathan what am i going to shade in 1st 55 tenths 5 tenths so 5 tenths is what
will i think there is a bell to be on there huh you got it on pink yeah it is on pink because that is what it was set as as do we have to have the colors change no you do not have to that okay so 5 tenths in one direction
is the red light are you using highlighters yes okay so what does that mean answer so what is 50 hundredths times 3 tenths 1515 what 15000 hundredths 15 hundredths okay does that make sense
yes 50 hundredths times 3 tenths is going to give me 15 hundredths no me andrew if it is 2 decimals it could get smaller or larger since you are multiplying below a whole you are multiplying below a whole so our decimal is going to be . smaller
model i want you to do this model on your paper on your graph and i want you to tell me what the number sentence should be on our in our notebook in your notebook
models you are drawing this model and you are telling me what number sentence would be correct for that model
did every model needs to have a number sentence with it yes the 1st one and that one and .
the colors are just switched yes it is is not it but you all chose it so that is funny how that figured it out did not it
write your number sentence your number sentence needs to have what you are multiplying by and you need to have the answer problem hey you are daydreaming you do not have time to daydream you should have already modeled that one on your paper here
okay so what is the 1st model that is going across show 5 tenths 5 tenths what does the next one show 3 tenths 3 tenths so we have 5 tenths times 3 tenths is going to give me what
okay what did you notice it was the same one that you chose earlier one now show this decimal model show put it on your paper as an example then try to find the number sentence okay you just have to move to the next one because you were not done
one do that one
it is fine you are just worried about having graph models you are not really worried about what that worksheet says
what 2828 make sure you put your decimal okay what is my number sentence 4 tenths 4 tenths times 7 tenths 7 tenths is going to give us what this what does this represent 2828 hundredths this purple represents what 7 tenths 7 tenths and this represents
four . 4 tenths and when you multiply them together you get 28 hundredths 28 hundredths good okay next one model just write the number sentence math journal is fine you do not have to model this one just write in your math journal write the number sentence i think we have the modeling
good so i should see a number sentence that includes what are you multiplying by and the answer
2 tenths 2 tenths times 5 tenths equals 10 tenths so this represents what five . 5 tenths this is 2 tenths and then this is 10 tenths or 110th okay write the number sentence for this one
model just write the number sentence look at the model
makai okay how many okay count all the way up and all the way over each color
way 66 what tenths tenths how many do i have going this way 7 tenths so this is 7 tenths this is 6 tenths so this whole section here is the overlapping
way you saw the 3 yeah you have to look at them this is the whole one color answer 40 two . 42 hundredths so we have 6 tenths times 7 tenths equals 42 hundredths i saw a lot of 3s out there 3 tenths and you saw 3 tenths because you were just looking at this one color of 3
you have to look this way because this is shaded all the way across remember so if that confuses you you need to do the model so that you can actually see what you are doing okay so for this one it is going all the way . across up how many is that seven . 7 tenths how many is here
110th 110th so 7 tenths times one tenths is going to give you 7 tenths because you should have how many shaded in here 7 overlapping 7 hundredths this is 110th and this is 7 tenths or 70 hundredths or 10 hundredths you can look at it either way because they are what
equivalent okay now what we are going to do is you have some cards on your desk and i am going to move a few of you but i am going to explain to it 1st
some of you have already played this game before because we introduced it . yeah the other day down someone turns a card over you roll the dice
dice so i have one and 936 if i rolled the dice and got a 5 you are going to multiply that answer by 5 game you the person who rolled is going to work it out
everybody else is going to check it to see if they are correct point you just keep playing this game until you use all the cards initials so like this group has riley mia zuhal hayden left for a few minutes
answer okay i am going to move some of you around group you 4 are going to move to this table
can we bring our math journal you take your math journal because you have got to do your work in your math journal cheyenne if you will move down one here so we put in the cards 0 we forgot to glue that in minute we do not need scissors glue and carpentry not yet
group okay i need 12345 you all move to the round table here well i am confused makai you are sitting right here
confusion you moved without me telling you to move here i told you this does not matter game we are not eating snack right now faithful off i put my wrapper in the trash okay well just put it in a paper towel we do not want food on the math stuff
okay somebody turn over a card dice does she solve it the fastest nope she solves it all of you are going to be doing the same problem to make sure she is correct point do they need 2 no one is yours
shh on your bottom have a seat have a seat shh have a seat okay you all should have already had one problem done
correct okay why do you all have so many cards 1st okay maddie you go 1st where is your math journal and pencil there is your number
it everybody else is solving it while you are solving it to see if you are correct point okay nathan have a seat okay whose turn is it solving it
okay so you all should be solving it along with her so that you know that she is correct that you just add a 0 you just add a 00 she would say . so she would say i am just going to add a 0 to my paycheck and see what i get right
10 to just move the decimal move the decimal to what what does that mean to the right huh to the right okay so i am going to move my decimal on my paycheck to the right ms value so i am multiplying by another what not a whole not a whole
10th yeah so you would move the 0 right and you would put the decimal right there correct you can not just add a 0 shh okay logan get busy
i do not know if she can be correct without a decimal wrong you got an 8 there right that would be the correct answer but you have to make sure you have all parts of the answer correct
0 this one needs a mark 0 yeah does anybody else get a point i get a point no you just get a point if you get it right hey i get a point i got a point i think i will do tally marks
way and then when you give 5 that is easier to keep count 0
faithful it is a good idea to have one person keep score for everybody okay we have to figure that out 0 yeah 609 dude 16 i do not know who did you get
what are you guys doing this is really easy huh okay so if you want to make it harder what could you do you could get 2 dice and make a 2 digit number decimal you can make it harder go get another decimal
cube i could do this 0 you could you could multiply the decimal by the decimal you can make it harder if you want shh okay faithful bottom you messed up
do not be mad those are 6 you can not change your answer what 1616 did you add 4 +4 to get 8 wrong i multiplied wrong because 4 times 4 is 16 okay all right next one
card yeah they got a table here huh it it was makai is okay so did makai get it correct yeah okay do you have that problem set up correctly though where do you put that 4 when you are multiplying the decimal under the one so i do not get anything i am just telling you for future this is how you need to write it
noise because when you have 2 digit numbers that you start multiplying that is not going to work like that is going to confuse you
correctly 0 i thought when you meant like line up then you like line up where it is . no you do not have to line up numbers in multiplying decimals noise i am knocking shit everywhere in the place you just made it a 9 did not i already get that card ms
yes yay 10 again that is i got 3.6 10 come on 10 is that down no it rolled off the table i am being generous
0 man he can not yeah he did see see multiply the decimal by a double digit number i did these 2 down there by a double digit okay keep going how many should you all have left on here
that is not fair lots
no come on guys you guys did this we have 2 bottoms to get up guys we decided to bring it all the way in
no but you are going to like i am going to like yeah right 0 yay what is what are you guys trying 0 okay
okay we are going to do that okay okay you have 2 minutes left in your game
game 2 minutes left left do not start riley she does not know yet
problem putting the cards back in the bag
it 54 faithful there you can not move because of the camera 32 directions okay on the board
door you are going to show me what you know about multiplying a decimal not i told him to sit there can you move into mia is desk please you are going to show me what you know about modeling a decimal by a decimal so you need out 2 colored pencils or crayons
1st put your hand down please let me give directions 1st you should have 4 graphs left over on your worksheet that i gave you earlier 4 you are going to show the model for 123 and 4 you are going to write the number sentence you are going to show me the answer and write the answer
so you have got to do the model cut it out glue it onto the paper write the number sentence above or below matter put your name on your paper is the 1st thing you need to do you have like 10 minutes to get this done you have to draw it on your graph that i gave you
here you are cutting this out gluing it on this paper writing the number sentence you will have to share scissors if you do not have your scissors with you everybody okay since this is your ticket out the door should you be talking to the people around you
no no wait you do not do that yet paper okay show me the 1st model show me 30 hundredths times 7 tenths
paper we do it 1st and then . it does not matter to me how you do it
paper no pencil it has to be colored pencils there is crayons in this box over here
here how could i do all at once let us do it one by one them who has my blue scissors someone come get them off the desk
i did it across across you got to go up huh okay what are you doing you are shading in what next 530 i am on the 2nd 10 you are on the 2nd one
it go ahead and do that okay so when you multiply these together you have got 2 wholes and 110th left over left over huh the answer
model i am doing it now okay i want you to check that answer when you do your model it yeah okay so this is 2 wholes and 10 hundredths what is this answer
21 hundredths 21 hundredths what do you have as your answer
are you doing 5 okay so that is 110th i am doing the 2nd one okay so this is 2 tenths and then you have to show 3 tenths 4 tenths 5 tenths you want to shade in the whole 10th why are we shading in the whole 10th why do we want to make sure we shade in the whole 10th you want to see what what do you want to see
if this is 7 tenths and this is 5 tenths what are you wanting to know you are wanting to know the what 10th what is overlapping what the answer is so that is 7 tenths times 5 tenths equals what
3500s 3500s i feel like something was wrong because you were not shading in the whole 10th
mister jones now listen carefully right this morning we will continue exploring exploring fractions
fraction we are only revising a few things before we get into the practice fractions now fabio could you tell us something about fraction when you are thinking fraction yes one half is the biggest one half is the biggest fraction good so we put the word biggest greatest larger
comparing so you are kind of comparing or ordering thing another 118th is the smallest one for which one this 18th was the smallest but that is not the smallest fraction there is more low but 18th was the one we did for the set
set so we did fraction of an area fraction of a set fraction of a group minutes that is why i have you all together here so we could look at it and explore more and go deeper and then go in the practice in your book
page i am going to put them on the board the page that i would like you to work with a partner when we finish know and some people i already kind of know but i am going to walk around and see how do you integrate the practice we did i mean the lesson we introduced and i put a few posters up there about fraction
yesterday and we talked about right somebody yeah numerator numerator and a denominator there is always say can i see you still yeah when we say numerator or denominator tell me something about denominator naila naila
represent what does when you see the denominator what do i have in mind the whole process the whole thing everything everything of the fraction that means the whole area or the whole group or the whole set it is the denominator like i have 3 fractions up there
i have 3 i have and then hold on half and i have 58th i mean 510th and i have 24 halves but we could tell 510th and 10 is the .
idea all right now i bring this part too i bring i bring this part that show you the whole many how many in this fraction one half 2 whole see it is 2 right and then we have the whole again from 0
it is a fraction line from 0 half to one half and then 222 halves 2 halves yes 2 halves all right see one if we want to divide it the whole in in let me wait for all in yep nixon and michael and michael yes
and michael so if i want to divide my my whole into halves or if i want to divide my whole in 4 people yeah so this is my whole this is 14th 24th which is the same as .
one half thank you and i have 34th which is the same as one half 1213rd yeah 14th i am going like this one half 13rd kind of close to 13rd but it is kind of
close 3 fourths is kind of almost 4 fourths almost so it is very close to 4 fourths which is the whole thing because i break it into 4 pieces and i could do the same here for 5
and if i have my whole and i go into happened so i have 15th 2 fifths 3 fifths 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 5 fifths so which is closer excuse me
which is closer 334th and 45th or 34th and 35th which which one is closer 34th . which one is closer together similar closer together 34th could you maybe put your that is it 34th 35th 34th and 35th or 34th and 45th 34th are they almost both of .
whole yeah they kind of almost right and then we are looking into 8th that is the 8th 8th the 8th and then see 4th become 8 which name 4th become become 8th if i want to put my whole into smaller fraction
8th right then if i want to go that same half i want to put it in 5th me when i am looking right here look look look i put that 55th right here 55th and i am lining it up with the .
half so what are we doing the pattern equivalent thank you yeah yeah that is another word we are going to look we have the vocabulary up there equivalent small group group we we did the group before but now we are going to go over it again
before i send you into the practice in your book with the pattern
up you may go and fix it for me please what thank you listen may i have your attention attention again
christine i need your attention the day before this is what we did and that is why we revised it on the poster when i put the poster up when i put the poster up so people are able are able to look at what we are those posters that i put up so people are kind of looking 0 we did this but we are going to do it for a group all right look again
huh thank you look again see we take the group and we you remember we had a half
half in half all right then we said half of this group we did the half this way and we did it that way also way all right we did half the 2 different ways way and we decided we decided .
ways half or or 121224 because we know for . equivalent the rectangle equivalent all right so 12 24 is half of this fraction or this set or this group
or this group let me wait for rudy me thank you all right next one come here all right next one we were going to 14th 14th of that half
or we could decide we decided we decided 4th or 4th of that same set is 6 is 6 pieces and it is out of the whole thing which is 24
and 14th we put it right there the equivalent of for this set which is 24 is thank you 6 yeah so 14th how many how many of this how many 4th is of half
yeah 66 but another word for this 4th is what half half of what half of the half of the half half of the half is 6 half of the half is 14th that is what we were looking into again and let us continue
this anybody anybody anybody you need to raise raise your hand please let me go into luji fraction only luji 14th now how many 4th of this one luji
4th wait a minute 2 34th 34th 34th is this 14th 24th 34th 0 i could do it this way 14th 24th 34th 0
shaded 34th 34th and that this is not 24th but this is 34th 34th of the whole set is shaded
this was 6 but i have 3 of these it 81219 she is not even looking
are i know if ludi was looking she would be the 1st one telling me naila chrislene chrislene can you yeah thank you now chrislene i have 14th here which is 624
now 34th must be how many pieces chrislene 4 yeah back 34th must be how many pieces luji there i have 14th look 14th is 6 pieces of the whole set
34th must be how many pieces 3 thank you 34th is how many of the whole set yes well okay but they did not get it
too see you were able to get it but some wait a minute one yes camille the question is for you now look at me what i have done yes
if anybody want to help camille they can raise their hand down i am going down so the fraction is going one half 14th and this one become .
fraction it is half of 14th it is 3 pieces attention the same word odd numbers but they are not really looking yeah okay with jimmy i know it is one and .
me 0 samantha is really there because we have done this before somebody now i have naila back now naila can you explain why do we call this 18th yeah why do we call this 18th because . look at this one and look at this one
why do we call this 18th okay why do we call this 18th 0 somebody is ready explain yes sir yes with . thank you so 3 and . that is why we call it another name an equivalent of this one
324324 which is equivalent to 18th for this set listen i am going to erase this and i need people is attention because i am going to ask you another question we never talked about before
yes we have 13rd we have 13rd i mean we have one half we have 14th
me 0 yeah that same set and how many is in this set 4 so we know 3 pieces is how many fraction 3 pieces 3 pieces is what fraction 18th 18th of the whole set and that is 324
clean thank you thank you very much it is hard to it is hard to keep it up listen what did we learn no wakudowali let us go wakudowali right michael what else did we learn we learned 18th let us go back
back one more fraction we learned with the whole set
wow okay half we will put one half and one half must be this way okay 0 that one half is 1224
right another fraction we learned for the set yes 14th and we put them in order and that 14th must be
okay all right so that is what what do we call it equivalent 624th 624th i have you back listen this is a new question and people need to think people need to think this is my sandwich half of my sandwich is 12 pieces out of 20 .
sandwich remember we said this is considered as a sandwich that i am eating now 14th if i decide to eat a 4th of my sandwich it would be 6 pieces out of 24 now if i decide to eat 13rd 13rd of my sandwich how many pieces would that be
you need to think and i am letting people think hm and i am letting people think and then i will say you know hold on
talk to your friend and say i want 13rd of my 13rd of my 8 pieces all right excuse me 13rd of my 24 pieces job let me see let me see
good rudy is talking over there i am looking for 13rd i want to eat 13rd how many pieces would that be pieces well jamie you may talk to anyone yeah yeah whistling you may get into that talking
saying when i raise my hand i am going to raise my hand in a minute pieces 13rd yeah a 3rd of my sandwich i am eating only a 3rd how many pieces would that be
13rd no sorry 4 okay back back back no no no no 2 somebody somebody is waiting i am nixon collins collins darlene good job
listen i am going to ask one person and if it is if you find that same answer do not tell me what to do please all right now if it is listen darlene now if it is the same answer we got to that person what do we do yes all right now rudy i am always calling your name and i know you very .
yes all right now what was the answer how many how many pieces would it be in what fraction numerator and denominator now let me wait for camille camille how many pieces we said 13rd of this set
one some people are not listening some people were not listening i heard some people were talking
nixon so i hear 3 people were talking and i heard the answer kind of but i was not sure right nixon what did you talk me about i said we said we said we talked about yeah we talked about listen listen girls girls yeah we said 12 over 24
yes yeah and then we are going to see the 13rd yeah 13rd must be be 13rd of this set must be 13rd i am going to find this and i okay that is what you talked about right yeah now let me go to another group okay let me go to another group
listen if it is your answer you need to go yes but if it is not then you need to say 0 how dolly dolly listen listen to another group
listen we are looking for how many pieces would be 13rd how many pieces would be 13rd 18th why do you say 18th we already know 18th is 3 pieces 06 it is 3 pieces 123 and we know 15th is 6 pieces now we are looking for 13rd 0 wow and using the same strategy
listen michael yes michael calm down all right listen why is 18th somebody was telling me yesterday okay all right so 8 x 3 is 24 on i am showing you something very important
4 times 6 is 24 and that is why we see 0 this is 14th we transfer what we have learned before into the fraction 12 times 12 is 24 and that is how we know half is 24 now can we use that strategy to get 13rd
maybe what can we do to get 13rd time 3 times 83 times equal 24 that tells us how many pieces 8 pieces not 18th 8 pieces that is what i asked you on you said .
i heard you were saying that but you missed kind of you go with 18th 18th is something different to a fraction you know what listen i am trying to kind of help you understand the way you said it and the way you told me is different so 13rd must be let me see
123456785678 so let us see
book so this is what we call 13rd and how many pieces is that 8 good 53rd so now how many 8 look
yes so 18th 18th 18th how many 8th how many 8th how many 8th 6 you are not looking
see 18th 18th 18th how many 8th 33 times 824 so the fraction for 18th another way an equivalent fraction would be is it 324 or 824824 because it is 8 pieces we call it 320 .
pieces 328 no but if i have the whole thing is 24 aha 3 look look we said 13rd is 624 so this one must be how many pieces 888 pieces so 824 is the same equivalent to .
324 is the same equivalent to 13rd of this you yep all right yes now any questions let me see people that has questions regarding regarding regarding the fraction of this set
set now if i have 16th i mean 13rd 13rd becomes 16th because half of 3 is 6 so 16th how many pieces would that be the smart people let me call see the smart people excuse me
16th 13rd is 8 pieces so 82416th must be 44240 you all getting it
see so this one is equal same thing as 4 24 24 now i get you luji do i really get you back yes you get this piece yes when i say 16th must be because 13rd is 824
so if i go 16th must be e times e see what we are doing we are matching facts time factors equals factors equal product we are kind of combining a lot of the learning we have done before
area the denominator i see some people are not paying attention so what i am going to do and i will go to 13rd 16th and one 18th 112th no 14th 112th 118th 0
yes why do you say 112th if i am going down 13rd 16th 112th what would it be had 84th yeah she gets it it becomes 2 if i go 112th equals 2 2 .
oops sorry 224th 124th 124th 124th is what one 148th 148th okay job i like that all right now another one and then we will go into our book practice now remember we went into a different different set
set we went into 13rd for this set set people that are looking with me see 13rd of this set let me see 13rd let me make it 13rd some people those guys on my left .
good are smart are smart day i am always smart i am always smart back getting me back fine now listen carefully listen we have a different different set which is we were looking for set 313rd wait a minute let me see
this one tells us how many in our set
we did that the day before or yesterday so it is 13rd is .
yes now i see some people are looking some people are talking and some people see those people that are talking they will not be able to do what we are going to have them do is on hold on let us wait for the talking so i can do a little bit of it and guide it to chrisline my favorite naila job all right so 13rd see this is a 3rd
13rd of this 13rd and i put 2 together so i add 13rd +13rd equals . 2 thirds thank you
that is right 13rd +13rd equals 2 and 2 thirds of the whole set guys okay and they call themselves the smartest me thank you now listen
13rd 23rd can i have 16th yeah 16th yes
good see now he is talking 16th now see we have 13rd if we are looking for 16th 16th must be see some people 0 now they are getting smarter let me see if they are talking together chrisline luji and naila
and we need people 5 there can not be you know 16th 16th there has to be 15th 16th if we have 13rd we could have 16th yeah i know yeah so how many pieces would that be that 16th must be how many 2 remember look in here that is 13rd 13rd 16th must be what
23rd 13rd 13rd you know if you shout if you are talking then it is not my thing i am not kidding i am not kidding why talking see they do not they did not hear
now how many people agree with this group over here look what did they say 16 must be what 110 he said 110 no
was 10 faces and we say 10 hey come back you got me back you you got me back i got you back you got me back i got you back
yeah i got you back all right so listen listen listen how many 10s are in here one look 1101102 no how many 6 are in here 2616162636 let me see
016 and that is that is 2 that is 22636263646 am i halfway listen am i 0 i cannot tolerate the way you turn around while we are doing it
here yeah so 36 must be .
368368 is the same equivalent yes and then we go 0 no no no no no
look 16th 26th 36th 46th 46th 76th 56th 106th 6th 76th 56th 106th 6th 66th 060 over . 06060th all right now wow
0 marco you know how to do it it did i say it guys let me see people who are paying attention to me
on sit down sit down sit down my friend virginie you are not listening to me virginie michael michael michael michael you are not listening what direction 1st you need listen job darlene thank you
leave it leave it because we need this darlene you are not sitting and listen direction now michael is not listening you see i am losing them yes
listen all right thank you
now we are going to go into your your book your book and in that book i want you to work page page one huh listen i will tell you which page page 13 i am going to put them on the board page 1356 and maybe we will get a chance to do a few problems
and the problems are on page 79 and 10 but we will do about 3 okay all right 5 and 6 and 6 all right so i am going to let you work for 10 minutes on this one because some people already did a few of them yeah few they understood but now i know they are going to kind of be now listen
i am going to have people go back to their seat but not everybody all right michael you may go back gerland gerland you may work with michael if you want to but if you all right now i am going to walk around and see know all right rudy you are going back to your seat and i am going to send you someone to work with you
me now you stay in your seat wait in your seat wegeni in your seat please page one page one page one we are going to omit page one page one we are going to omit one what does it mean omit omit means leave it
leave page one yeah because we have done that before we have done page one you did page one
me you did page one so i want you to go on to page hold on he is not listening page half of a rectangle which page page 5 okay 5 page 5 all right yeah page 5 yeah page 5 all right hold on
see some people page 5 page 5 yes 6
and some people have done it and it is easy right yes 55 good job 5 nixon number one please
one page 5 fabio fabio 55 unit 6 page 5 good job 6 okay wegeni number 2 please
wegeni what fraction is that 14th what is your name wegeni no number one no wegeni what fraction on page 5 number 2 is what fraction wow some people are really not listening that is the thing
look how many what is the denominator the whole thing the whole thing how many pieces can you look at how many pieces denominator no it is number 2 yeah how many pieces 14th so the denominator is 8 so how many is shady
18th 18th yes all right now let us look at another person that is really good at it up good job
up now the number 3 is too easy yeah yeah number 3 this one sir thank you
up now chris you did so well in this now let let me go into one of the problems on page 90 no no let us go 0 yeah page 6 is one of the problems that i feel dolly could help with
dolly okay now it says listen let us see people who are looking at one of the problems on page 66 on page 6665 do not make 6 michael 6 yes yes good job
6 very good us ethan has 24 marbles thank you
24 let me see let me see the fraction fraction it yeah how many
28 what did we do when what did we do when we need to find the fraction of a set did she is trying and the set has 24 how did we use can we use this that is why i needed you to keep it up see
up all right so that is why i needed you to keep it up here okay so let us go back to the set of 24 on look look look in here can i go to the bathroom okay all right hold on hold on we we i have a pencil for people that need to borrow a pencil
listen can i am going to see if this one can help you fabio 24 we had half we had 14th and we had excuse me 18th 18th 18th you are not looking
looking see see 18th and 28th what do you think 28th might be
be 62 would be the so 28th might be the same that because because if i know 18th is 328th might be another 3 it might be 666 so now you got me back 3 +3 is 6
you yes so 18th is 324 be 624 so 28th might be might be 28th might be 624 624 and do i have 6 up here no you have 3 so 28th is the same as .
as 28th is the same as look at this 2 look at this 2 some people are not looking they do not get it see we did it up here we said i knew it
28th must be another 18th 18th +18th equal 28th and then 18th and when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see it is only one no no minute what do i see when i am looking at 14th and 18th what do i see yeah 14th and 28th what do i see
amount so what do we call 28th and 14th is equal equavalent thank you very much number how many pieces 24 now what do we write down for the problem ruby gets ruby gets ruby gets marbles ruby gets 6 marbles 6 marbles do you write a sentence
let me see if people write a sentence yeah the sentence is how many marbles does ruby get 6 ruby gets 6 marbles no that is a u ruby ruby gets 6 marbles do you write it down ruby gets gets 6 marbles ruby gets
back so now look at that she is doing number 2 so if you are doing number 2 let me see because we are about to finish and we did a set we did a problem and then we will continue doing those kind of problems job quick we are doing the 2nd one number 2 number 2 and then we are about to finish and say what did we learn
2 some people already do number 2 ruby gets how many pieces were you looking when i get 66 all right now do the 2nd 11 see people who do the 2nd one quick later on i have .
he is thinking but too loud
it ah i am glad i told you see okay you are all ready minute 34th 34th of 24 remember we learned about 34th of 20
that 35 by 3 we did half look look look people that are looking see that is 14th that is 24th how many pieces half and 34th 34th is how many
many how many pieces 8 pieces wait a minute 14th 24th 34th 18 pieces 18 pieces yes yes 0 good we did that before
yes did you guys see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see the sentence let me see many ethan 0 yeah sentence mister jones got me back got me back the sentence
sentence ethan gets 18 toys toys down i wrote a rubric he said rubric gets 8 cards he said he can get 18 cards open it so we can see it we will we will let you do more problems yeah we will let you do more problems somebody ask him
one more one more hold on on let me let me stop for a minute look at the ends 2 thank you now i am going to ask a simple question a simple question to dolly
yeah give me your give me give me your attention do i have you back yes yes michael i have your back fabio i have your back yes okay
all right see he he is talking if i have you back then you are listening not talking nice now orleans yeah give me one thing we learned during this time of math this morning
what did we learn remember what we were you know remember our objective for the for the week week for the week all right remember this one here
down finding student will be able to find fraction part of a group or any area in the num meaning of numerator and denominator thank you very much now i see michael warren really listening yes maybe he could tell me one thing now .
one thing one thing one thing if you are ready to say one thing that we learned this morning that you feel strong and i could explain it i could write it in my learner is notebook and i could take it home with me
24 it could be something but all right all right it could be out of a set thing today and tomorrow i learned about it 0 some people are not listening somebody is sharing some people are not
listening and abigail is not listening 0 yeah we are about to finish thank you we are about to finish our lesson and then we need somebody who can tell us a few things we learned simple
2 yeah go ahead today i learned the fraction of a set and i learned that danny danny danny is the whole set of a fraction thank you very much that is one thing one fact about fractions what we learn the denominator is the whole set number or the number in the set
i i will come to you because i know you have something nice luji luji if you are going to write home about math tomorrow i am going to read it in your book good job yeah what is it what would you tell your mom or dad about what we learned today
yes so .
yes james i heard that a set of fractions could be divided into many sets of pieces thank you we also learned no hold on one fact a set of fractions could be learned into many .
many pieces many pieces and you could tell the fraction but the fraction pieces see you are not really listening now today i learnt that no say it louder today we learn how to add fractions add
set one half of a set +one half of a set is equal to the whole thing how about a word equ .
equivalent equal anybody pick up anything what is equal what fraction is equivalent equivalent equal she does not know see will i am losing you
will now tell me something about equal equivalent yeah wait yeah nixon nixon
go ignore yeah 7 half 7 half 7 14 is a to something now anything about equal equal equal equivalent she said 7 14 is equivalent to .
half i got one i got one 7 14 is equivalent to half one half is i mean 12 over 24 to a half thank you 00
to half half and 13rd is equivalent to half now 13rd 13rd is equivalent to equivalent 262613rd is equivalent to 262 pieces out of 6 pieces we have got your back all right i have got your back all right now listen carefully listen listen
for those of you that were paying attention and i know those people who they are they are ready to do more problems me she said 0 i can do this can i do more now i am going to give you about one minute 2
way water bottles put them on the floor put them on the floor caleb please come sit here come sit here 0 my god maddie why do not you sit here
okay we are going to practice modeling multiplying and dividing decimals by another decimal that i would rather you not do markers
good okay just put them on the back counter for right now
here okay okay
clicker all right so on your math journal write how do you model a multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
model everybody needs to have their question down
ryan you are putting in front of how do you model multiplication of a decimal by another decimal
okay you should be close to being done so that i can switch the screen okay pencils are down when you are done so i know i can move on
okay tell me how multiplying a decimal by a decimal will be similar to money me caleb because money is a decimal or a fraction of a dollar okay because quarters or are those dimes these are dimes
i a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths okay so a dime is 110th or 10 hundredths which is ¢10 right yes okay okay so how would my what would my multiplication problem look like to show this answer
what would i write a 10th times a 10th because i have how many dimes is a dollar okay good
one how would i write write the multiplication problem for this on your paper
shane 110th times 5 times 5 $0.504 times decimals it is 50 what one show that number of cents with quarters quarters caleb now is not the time
cents so what is my number of cents ryan 25 hundredths . huh 5 good 25 hundredths times 3 equals 75 hundredths 75 hundredths okay now we are going to look at a decimal by a decimal
so i want you on the graph paper that i gave you i want you to show me the model give me a decimal ryan 52 hundredths 52 hundredths yeah okay so you are going to show 52 hundredths times give me a number
elika 33 tenths yes okay so 52 we can not do 52 though we have to do 50 for right now yet 50 hundredths times 3 tenths so model that on your paper graph do not worry about where it says decimal fraction simplified
chart you can use crayons
it you are modeling it
model so 50 hundredths times 3 tenths what would that look like as a model 50 hundredths what is 50 hundredths show me 50 hundredths on your model here
like okay so what does 5 tenths look like in blue and yellow works best
best because you can see the color you can see the color change what you do not have to use those colors see i like the way sawyer is turned out
there okay so nathan what am i going to shade in 1st 55 tenths 5 tenths so 5 tenths is what
will i think there is a bell to be on there huh you got it on pink yeah it is on pink because that is what it was set as as do we have to have the colors change no you do not have to that okay so 5 tenths in one direction
are you using highlighters yes
so what is 50 hundredths times 3 tenths 1515 what 15000 hundredths 15 hundredths okay does that make sense yes 50 hundredths times 3 tenths is going to give me 15 hundredths no
me andrew if it is 2 decimals it could get smaller or larger since you are multiplying below a whole you are multiplying below a whole so our decimal is going to be . smaller smaller it is not larger model i want you to do this model on your paper on your graph and i want you to tell me what the number sentence should be
on our in our notebook in your notebook
models you are drawing this model and you are telling me what number sentence would be correct for that model
did every model needs to have a number sentence with it yes the 1st one and that one and .
the colors are just switched yes it is is not it but you all chose it so that is funny how that figured it out did not it
write your number sentence your number sentence needs to have what you are multiplying by and you need to have the answer problem hey you are daydreaming you do not have time to daydream you should have already modeled that one on your paper here
okay so what is the 1st model that is going across show 5 tenths 5 tenths what does the next one show 3 tenths 3 tenths so we have 5 tenths times 3 tenths is going to give me what
notice it was the same one that you chose earlier one now show this decimal model show put it on your paper as an example then try to find the number sentence okay you just have to move to the next one because you were not done
one do that one
it is fine you are just worried about having graph models you are not really worried about what that worksheet says
boxes multiply multiply 4 times 7 is what 2828 make sure you put your decimal okay what is my number sentence 4 tenths 4 tenths times 7 tenths 7 tenths is going to give us what this what does this represent 2828 hundredths this purple represents what
7 tenths 7 tenths and this represents get 28 hundredths 28 hundredths good okay next one model just write the number sentence math journal is fine you do not have to model this one just write in your math journal write the number sentence i think we have the modeling
good so i should see a number sentence that includes what are you multiplying by and the answer
2 tenths 2 tenths times 5 tenths equals 10 tenths so this represents what five . 5 tenths this is 2 tenths and then this is 10 tenths or 110th okay write the number sentence for this one
model just write the number sentence look at the model
makai okay how many okay count all the way up and all the way over each color
way 66 what tenths tenths how many do i have going this way 7 tenths so this is 7 tenths this is 6 tenths so this whole section here is the overlapping this is not just the rows that you were looking at
way you saw the 3 yeah you have to look at them this is the whole one color answer 40 two . 42 hundredths so we have 6 tenths times 7 tenths equals 42 hundredths i saw a lot of 3s out there 3 tenths and you saw 3 tenths because you were just looking at this one color of 3
you have to look this way because this is shaded all the way across remember so if that confuses you you need to do the model so that you can actually see what you are doing okay so for this one it is going all the way . across up how many is that
110th 110th so 7 tenths times one tenths is going to give you 7 tenths because you should have how many shaded in here 7 overlapping 7 hundredths this is 110th and this is 7 tenths or 70 hundredths or 10 hundredths you can look at it either way because they are what
equivalent okay now what we are going to do is you have some cards on your desk and i am going to move a few of you but i am going to explain to it 1st
some of you have already played this game before because we introduced it . yeah the other day down someone turns a card over you roll the dice
dice so i have one and 936 if i rolled the dice and got a 5 you are going to multiply that answer by 5 game you the person who rolled is going to work it out
everybody else is going to check it to see if they are correct point you just keep playing this game until you use all the cards initials so like this group has riley mia zuhal hayden left for a few minutes
answer okay i am going to move some of you around group you 4 are going to move to this table
can we bring our math journal you take your math journal because you have got to do your work in your math journal cheyenne if you will move down one here so we put in the cards 0 we forgot to glue that in minute we do not need scissors glue and carpentry not yet
group okay i need 12345 you all move to the round table here well i am confused makai you are sitting right here
confusion you moved without me telling you to move here i told you this does not matter game we are not eating snack right now faithful off i put my wrapper in the trash okay well just put it in a paper towel we do not want food on the math stuff
okay somebody turn over a card dice does she solve it the fastest nope she solves it all of you are going to be doing the same problem to make sure she is correct point do they need 2 no one is yours
bottom have a seat have a seat shh have a seat okay you all should have already had one problem done
correct okay why do you all have so many cards 1st who went 1st okay maddie you go 1st pencil there is your number solve it
everybody else is solving it while you are solving it to see if you are correct point okay nathan have a seat okay whose turn is it solving it
okay so you all should be solving it along with her so that you know that she is correct that you just add a 0 you just add a 00 she would say . so she would say i am just going to add a 0 to my paycheck and see what i get right
10 to just move the decimal move the decimal to what what does that mean to the right huh to the right okay so i am going to move my decimal on my paycheck to the right ms value so i am multiplying by another what not a whole not a whole
10th yeah so you would move the 0 right and you would put the decimal right there correct you can not just add a 0 shh okay logan get busy
i do not know if she can be correct without a decimal wrong you got an 8 there right that would be the correct answer but you have to make sure you have all parts of the answer correct
0 this one needs a mark 0 yeah does anybody else get a point i get a point no you just get a point if you get it right hey i get a point i got a point i think i will do tally marks
way and then when you give 5 that is easier to keep count 0
faithful it is a good idea to have one person keep score for everybody out 0 yeah 609 dude 16 i do not know who did you get
called what are you guys doing this is really easy huh okay so if you want to make it harder what could you do you could get 2 dice and make a 2 digit number decimal you can make it harder go get another decimal
cube i could do this 0 you could you could multiply the decimal by the decimal you can make it harder if you want i did because i did not want them up on the desk shh okay faithful bottom you messed up
do not be mad those are 6 you can not change your answer what 1616 did you add 4 +4 to get 8 wrong i multiplied wrong because 4 times 4 is 16 okay all right next one
card yeah they got a table here huh they have to tie well no it it was makai is okay so did makai get it correct though where do you put that 4 when you are multiplying the decimal under the one so i do not get anything i am just telling you for future this is how you need to write it
noise because when you have 2 digit numbers that you start multiplying that is not going to work like that is going to confuse you
correctly 0 i thought when you meant like line up then you like line up where it is . no you do not have to line up numbers in multiplying decimals noise i am knocking shit everywhere in the place you just made it a 9
yes yay 10 again that is i got 3.6 man come on 10
10 is that down no it rolled off the table i am being generous 0 man he can not yeah he did see see
multiply the decimal by a double digit number i did these 2 down there by a double digit okay keep going how many should you all have left on here
that is not fair lots
no come on guys you guys did this we have 2 bottoms to get up guys we decided to bring it all the way in
no but you are going to like i am going to like yeah right 0 yay what is what are you guys trying 0 okay
okay we are going to do that okay okay you have 2 minutes left in your game
game 2 minutes left left do not start riley she does not know yet
why do not you just do it real quick and that is always your guy okay okay one minute
problem putting the cards back in the bag
you all did not have bags because i had it on the table yeah that is right so that is my point right
right 33 you are right yours is correct okay i won 54 faithful
there you can not move because of the camera 32 directions okay on the board door you are going to show me what you know about multiplying a decimal
if i am talking you are not i told him to sit there can you move into mia is desk please you are going to show me what you know about modeling a decimal by a decimal so you need out 2 colored pencils or crayons 1st put your hand down please let me give directions
1st you should have 4 graphs left over on your worksheet that i gave you earlier 4 you are going to show the model for 123 and 4 you are going to write the number sentence you are going to show me the answer and write the answer so you have got to do the model cut it out glue it onto the paper write the number sentence above or below
matter put your name on your paper is the 1st thing you need to do done you have to draw it on your graph that i gave you here you are cutting this out gluing it on this paper writing the number sentence you will have to share scissors if you do not have your scissors with you
everybody okay since this is your ticket out the door should you be talking to the people around you no no wait you do not do that yet paper okay show me the 1st model
show me 30 hundredths times 7 tenths paper we do it 1st and then . it does not matter to me how you do it
paper no pencils there is crayons in this box over here
okay so you are cutting this out here how could i do all at once let us do it one by one them who has my blue scissors desk 0 you know what
i did it across across you got to go up huh okay what are you doing you are shading in what next 530 i am on the 2nd 10 you are on the 2nd one where is the 1st one
that okay so when you multiply these together you have got 2 wholes and 110th left over model i am doing it now okay
model i want you to check your answer when you do that model it yeah okay so this is 2 wholes and 10 hundredths what is this answer 21 hundredths 21 hundredths what do you have as your answer
110th i am doing the 2nd one okay so this is 2 tenths and then you have to show 3 tenths 4 tenths 5 tenths you want to shade in the whole 10th why are we shading in the whole 10th why do we want to make sure we shade in the whole 10th you want to see what what do you want to see
if this is 7 tenths and this is 5 tenths what are you wanting to know you are wanting to know the what 10th what is overlapping what the answer is
so that is 7 tenths times 5 tenths equals what 3500s 3500s i feel like something was wrong because you were not shading in the whole 10th
okay class today we are going to talk about volume and when we talk about volume we have to think about 3 dimensions the length the height and the width okay
so we know for a fact that volume is equal to what alan length width height length times width times height height 3 dimensions okay
here so i am going to start right here much or how many units units so i am going to count 123456
this is the length 6 the width because remember that we are using 3 dimensions so our box is going to be 3 dimensional
so everything is going to be here so it is going to be 123455 so i have the 3 dimensions in my face of 6 units by 4 units by 5 units
so the length the width and the height box i am going to plot the same thing but in the same direction okay so let us think about the length
the length in this line is going to be how many units units 123456 that is my length okay
here so i have one face of my box now we already did the length let us do the width let us continue with the width
starting right here you are going to count 1234 because the width is equal 4
okay so that should be connected right here right sides from here how many units i have to count to put the height
jaime 55123455 and what about from here james or jaime the height how many
units 12345 okay i need another height and it is right here
so i just have to connect my corners remember vertices vertices when it is more than one when it is only one okay i am going to connect this and i am going to connect this can you visualize the box
yes okay now let us make sure that our dimensions is the same everywhere 6 length 4 width 5 height what dimension is that one juliana 5 what dimension is length height it is a height and height is
5 let us count 12345 so this is 51 daniel 4 what dimension is that 18 who can help daniel
carlos the width the width and the width is 12344 daniel again what dimension is that one length length and the length is 6123456
6 now this dimension is what dimension length height height the one that i am tracing right now ceci length length units 6
units so everywhere you go what about this 11 cutting height height and height is units so everywhere you go our box is it has the same dimensions
but before that if we have to apply that formula to find the volume of this box what we should what are we suppose to do
so let us say volume of this box right here and we are going to say that this box is a and the one that you are going to make is b okay so for box number a what is the volume alan 6 x 4 x 5
okay volume will be 6 times 4 times 55 and how much is that only one person 120 how did you figure it out luis
i did 6 x 4 equals 24 and i did 24 x 5 equals 120 120 so the volume is 120 this 14 units by 9 units by 11 units
and just follow the steps that i did in this box foreign language okay foreign language i am going to ask some questions about it so you need to figure out if you are going to use the paper and landscape
landscape wait yes show show to the whole class what landscape means means like that so you have to decide in what way you are going to do that you need to use your ruler
it you have to look for that point in this plane or grid plot it and then connect those points and make the box yes can we use colors you are going to use color at the end kevin used a ruler okay kevin do you have a ruler with this you have a ruler
foreign language okay
portrait landscape you need to use pencil
again in this box if you look at the box how many faces in this box
6 can you go over there and count it for me so the whole class will see how many faces or sides you see in the box it 123456 and 6 in the back okay
diego and remember at the end that you need to label label your box
this you are using the portrait so i am going to look like this did the length the length and how many units on the length 1414 okay now you just put 14 length is equal 14 and this is what
width the width so you put w and the value of the width which is
units and the height 1111 so height is 11 now you have the front part and the bottom part of the box
now luis can you tell me how what are you doing right here i am doing the length 1st then i am doing the width and then the height so you need to label any unit that you count there with a little period there label means also showing me this okay
count so for length is 14 yes now bryan what faces of the box do you have already here
i already did the front i am still working on i am trying to do the top of the top so you only need to connect those 2 right here part huh and so you need the bottom part and the back part of the box
huh whoever finishes 1st i want the person to go and plot those on the board and tell the class the steps that you followed to plot those points on the grid and what did you find 1st 2nd and 3rd
sometimes we use strategies to beginning with the bottom or the top or the front
almost done carlos okay i think you got it carlos are you making sure that units 99 how many units do you have there
points 99 okay so i see that carlos is done with the length width and height
carlos you want to go over there and plot those points on the grid
okay let me see if i have enough sometimes .
okay i am going to trace a little line between because we are not going to have enough when we are going to put it here
so i am going to try to be right in the middle like this to have enough we are assuming that this is even okay
did anybody find out already the volume of the box
okay almost okay
try to be as much as i can very accurate okay is that the volume okay
now class carlos is going to explain carlos you can use the purple one which is dark is that the volume yes
here so i am going to give you the maybe the point is going to be maybe right here class you doing the length
so that is going to be the length you can just trace it huh exactly and make a big one right here too
length 1414 right 1423456789 units good for you okay and the height is
1111 width is 9 the height is 11 okay carlos
right there i can give you a hand on that okay for the height carlos our box is going to be more than that it is going to be huge up there so we are not going to have a space for that okay this right here and so one just try to do the .
as much as you can carlos okay it is right there okay so try to connect it like that okay
carlos so the height is
units carlos we cannot go more because we are not going to have a space for that
so we have the front and the bottom of our box thank you carlos now who can tell me what is the volume of that
volume the volume is so to get the volume we just have to multiply 14 x 9 x 11
how much is that bryan landaverde 13861386 who is agreeing with that
sir how did you figure it out how much is 14 times 9 how much is 14 times 45360 so 360 times 11 is that okay
so let us find out 14 times 9 much 3630660 it cannot be 4 times 9 how much is 4 times 9
6 and one times 99 is 9 +31212 so 14 times 9 is a 126 and then you multiply 126 times what
1111 and that would be 6 821621 it is going to be 6831 so you have the same thing okay
1386 that means that means that with those 3 dimensions that box can carry 1386
13086 okay the main focus for this was what i am trying to get from you people is to learn how to identify the length the width and the height
okay on your desk you should have your math journal scissors glue and a pencil anything else on your desk you need to take it off so it is not in the way
water bottles put them on the floor put them on the floor caleb please come sit here come sit here 0 my god
maddie why do not you sit here okay we are going to practice modeling multiplying and dividing decimals by another decimal so i am going to give you graph paper you do not need it quite yet just kind of put it to the side you will fill in in a minute take out some colored pencils also i forgot to tell you to do that
i would rather you not do markers crayons or colored pencils are good okay just put them on the back counter for right now
okay tell me how multiplying a decimal by a decimal will be similar to money me caleb because money is a decimal or a fraction of a dollar okay because quarters or are those dimes
write a 10th times a 10th because i have how many dimes is a dollar okay good alright look at this one how would i write write the multiplication problem for this on your paper
shane 110th times 5 times 5 which is going to equal what ¢50 what 100s good okay do this one
okay make sure you have a number of cents i just do not want to see the answer i want to see the number of cents so what is my number of cents ryan
25 hundredths . huh 5 good 25 hundredths times 3 equals 75 hundredths 75 hundredths okay now we are going to look at a decimal by a decimal so i want you on the graph paper that i gave you i want you to show me the model
ryan 52 hundredths 52 hundredths yeah okay so you are going to show 52 hundredths times give me a number elika 33 tenths yes okay so 52
we can not do 52 though we have to do 50 for right now yet 50 hundredths times 3 tenths so model that on your paper graph do not worry about where it says decimal fraction simplified that is for another activity
model so 50 hundredths times 3 tenths what would that look like as a model
50 hundredths what is 50 hundredths show me 50 hundredths on your model here
what does 110th look like okay so what does 5 tenths look like so you should be shading in
best because you can see the color you can see the color change and the color change is what you do not have to use those colors i am just telling you it is easier to see
out these need to stay there okay so nathan what am i going to shade in 1st 55 tenths 5 tenths so 5 tenths is what
will i think there is a bell to be on there huh pink yeah it is on pink because that is what it was set as that is what we are going to leave it as to it is just easier to see the answer if you do that
50 hundredths times 3 tenths is going to give me 15 hundredths no me andrew if it is 2 decimals it could get smaller or larger since you are multiplying below a whole you are multiplying below a whole so our decimal is going to be . smaller smaller it is not larger
model i want you to do this model on your paper on your graph and i want you to tell me what the number sentence should be on our in our notebook in your notebook so you have blank models
you are drawing this model and you are telling me what number sentence would be correct for that model
did every model needs to have a number sentence with it yes the 1st one and that one and .
the colors are just switched yes it is is not it but you all chose it so that is funny how that figured it out did not it
show 5 tenths 5 tenths what does the next one show 3 tenths 3 tenths so we have 5 tenths times 3 tenths is going to give me what okay what did you notice it was the same one that you chose earlier is not that funny so which one is it a b or c
one now show this decimal model show put it on your paper as an example then try to find the number sentence okay you just have to move to the next one because you were not done do that one do that one
this what does this represent 2828 hundredths this purple represents what 7 tenths 7 tenths and this represents four . 4 tenths and when you multiply them together you get 28 hundredths 28 hundredths good okay next one
model just write the number sentence math journal is fine you do not have to model this one just write in your math journal write the number sentence i think we have the modeling we are pretty good
here 2 tenths 2 tenths times 5 tenths equals 10 tenths so this represents what five . 5 tenths this is 2 tenths and then this is 10 tenths or 110th okay write the number sentence for this one
model just write the number sentence look at the model
okay count all the way up and all the way over each color like how many do i have going this way 66 what tenths tenths how many do i have going this way
7 tenths so this is 7 tenths this is 6 tenths so this whole section here is the overlapping this is not just the rows that you were looking at way you saw the 3 yeah you have to look at them this is the whole one color
answer 40 two . 42 hundredths so we have 6 tenths times 7 tenths equals 42 hundredths i saw a lot of 3s out there 3 tenths and you saw 3 tenths because you were just looking at this one color of 3 you have to look this way because this is shaded all the way across
0 remember so if that confuses you you need to do the model so that you can actually see what you are doing okay so for this one it is going all the way . across across up up how many is that seven . 7 tenths how many is here
110th 110th so 7 tenths times one tenths is going to give you 7 tenths because you should have how many shaded in here overlapping 7 hundredths this is 110th and this is 7 tenths or 70 hundredths or 10 hundredths you can look at it either way because they are what
they are equivalent okay now what we are going to do is you have some cards on your desk and i am going to move a few of you but i am going to explain to it 1st
some of you have already played this game before because we introduced it . yeah the other day down someone turns a card over you roll the dice so i turn the card over i roll the dice
so i have one and 936 if i rolled the dice and got a 5 you are going to multiply that answer by 5 this is not a game you the person who rolled is going to work it out
everybody else is going to check it to see if they are correct point you just keep playing this game until you use all the cards initials so like this group has riley mia zuhal hayden left for a few minutes so you are just going to keep a tally of who points
can we bring our math journal you take your math journal because you have got to do your work in your math journal cheyenne if you will move down one makai move back we need a scissor you do not need scissors and glue anymore here is your cards here so we put in the cards 0 we forgot to glue that in we will glue it in in a minute we do not need scissors glue and carpentry not yet
so you move back you are working with this group okay i need 12345 you all move to the round table cheyenne you all are staying right here
all of you are going to be doing the same problem to make sure she is correct if she is correct she has to multiply it 1st if she is right she gets the point do they need 2 no one is yours shh on your bottom have a seat have a seat shh have a seat okay you all should have already had one problem done who turned who rolled it
everybody else should be solving it with you to see if you are correct okay why do you all have so many cards who did it 1st who went 1st okay maddie you go 1st where is your math journal and pencil there is your number solve it
everybody else is solving it while you are solving it to see if you are correct if she gets it correct she gets a point okay nathan have a seat
it okay so you all should be solving it along with her so that you know that she is correct okay that is multiplying by 10 do you have to do all that work for that how could you do that you just add a 0 you just add a 0
10 to just move the decimal move the decimal to what what does that mean to the right huh to the right okay so i am going to move my decimal on my paycheck to the right ms godfrey i reviewed this last night what does that mean value so i am multiplying by another what
value so you are multiplying by a 10th yeah so you would move the 0 right and you would put the decimal right there correct you can not just add a 0 shh
way and then when you give 5 that is easier to keep count 0
bottoms you have got to be on your bottom faithful it is a good idea to have one person keep score for everybody okay we have to figure that out 0 yeah 609 dude 16 i do not know who did you get 0
not 12 where are the 10s i do not know i do not know what did you get
huh okay so if you want to make it harder what could you do
shh okay faithful bottom you messed up 6 you can not change your answer and it was an 8 before what did you do wrong say what did you do wrong i did 4 times 4 wrong because 4 times 4 is what
1616 did you add 4 +4 to get 8 did you add or did you multiply wrong i multiplied wrong because 4 times 4 is 16 okay all right next one
draw a card yeah they got a table here huh
it it was makai is okay so did makai get it correct yeah okay do you have that problem set up correctly though where do you put that 4 when you are multiplying the decimal under the one so i do not get anything i am just telling you for future this is how you need to write it
noise because when you have 2 digit numbers that you start multiplying that is not going to work this is what it is going to look like that is going to confuse you
yes yay 10 again that is i got 3.6 i beat you andrew i beat you
10 is that down no it rolled off the table i am being generous 0 man he can not yeah he did
come on guys you guys did this we have 2 bottoms to get up in no but you are going to like i am going to like yeah right 0 yay
that okay okay you have 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left in your game 2 minutes left do not start that yet 2 minutes left do not start riley she does not know yet
why do not you just do it real quick and that is always your guy
it 54 faithful you have to stay there you can not move because of the camera 32
ready logan should be ready you are waiting for the next directions door you are going to show me what you know about multiplying a decimal if i am talking you are not
i told him to sit there can you move into mia is desk please you are going to show me what you know about modeling a decimal by a decimal so you need out 2 colored pencils or crayons it does not matter to me what you do 1st put your hand down please let me give directions
1st you should have 4 graphs left over on your worksheet that i gave you earlier 5 some have 5 some messed up so some people have 4 you are going to show the model for 123 and 4 you are going to write the number sentence you are going to show me the answer and write the answer so you have got to do the model cut it out glue it onto the paper write the number sentence above or below
matter put your name on your paper is the 1st thing you need to do you have like 10 minutes to get this done you have to draw it on your graph that i gave you here you are cutting this out gluing it on this paper writing the number sentence you will have to share scissors if you do not have your scissors with you
i have a couple but i do not have enough for everybody okay since this is your ticket out the door should you be talking to the people around you no no wait you do not do that yet
where is your graph paper okay show me the 1st model show me 30 hundredths times 7 tenths cut it out paper we do it 1st and then . it does not matter to me how you do it
started where is your graph okay because you were not in here who else was not in here no you have to show me with colored pencils you can not show me shading with pencil it has to be colored pencils there is crayons in this box over here
you can go get them faithful on the red shelf are some crayons okay so you are cutting this out you are gluing it on here
how could i do all at once let us do it one by one
that okay so when you multiply these together you have got 2 wholes and 110th left over left over huh the answer model i am doing it now
model i want you to check your answer when you do that model it yeah okay so this is 2 wholes and 10 hundredths what is this answer
21 hundredths 21 hundredths what do you have as your answer 2 and one
okay so this is 2 tenths and then you have to show 3 tenths 4 tenths 5 tenths you want to shade in the whole 10th why are we shading in the whole 10th why do we want to make sure we shade in the whole 10th you want to see what
see if this is 7 tenths and this is 5 tenths what are you wanting to know you are wanting to know the what 10th what is overlapping what the answer is
okay class today we are going to talk about volume and when we talk about volume we have to think about 3 dimensions the length the height and the width okay
so we know for a fact that volume is equal to what alan length width height length times width times height height 3 dimensions okay
start point let us call the start point okay here so i am going to start right here much or how many units 6
6 units so i am going to count 123456 this is the length 6 the width because remember that we are using 3 dimensions so our box is going to be 3 dimensional
starting right here how many units is the width jose
4 units 4 units so 12341234 4 now let us go to the height how many units is the height patricia 55
so everything is going to be here so it is going to be 123455 so i have the 3 dimensions in my face of 6 units by 4 units by 5 units
so the length the width and the height box i am going to plot the same thing but in the same direction okay so let us think about the length
the length in this line is going to be how many units diego 66 units 123456 that is my length okay
here so i have one face of my box
okay so that should be connected right here right so we have the front we have the bottom now let us go to the sides
from here how many units i have to count to put the height jaime 55123455 and what about from here james or jaime the height how many
vertices vertices when it is more than one when it is only one okay i am going to connect this and i am going to connect this yes okay now let us make sure that our dimensions is the same everywhere
6 length 4 width 5 height what dimension is that one is juliana 5 what dimension is length height it is a height and height is 5 let us count 12345 so this is 5
what dimension is that one daniel 4 what dimension is that 18 who can help daniel carlos the width the width and the width is 12344 daniel again what dimension is that one
length length and the length is 6123456
6 now this dimension is what dimension now ceci length length and length is how many units 6
6 units so everywhere you go what about this 11 cutting height height and height is
so let us say volume of this box right here and we are going to say that this box is a and the one that you are going to make is b okay so for box number a what is the volume alan 5 okay volume will be 6 times 4 times .
55 and how much is that 120 how did you figure it out luis i did 6 x 4 equals 24 and i did 24 x 5 equals 120
120 so the volume is 120 this 14 units by 9 units by 11 units and just follow the steps that i did in this building this box
foreign language okay foreign language i am going to ask some questions about it
it you have to look for that point in this plane or grid plot it and then connect those points and make the box yes can we use colors you are going to use color at the end kevin used a ruler okay kevin do you have a ruler with this you have a ruler
foreign language okay
okay what way are you going to use landscape or portrait
landscape you need to use pencil you use colors after that okay
6 can you go over there and count it for me so the whole class will see how many faces or sides you see in the box it 123456 and 6 in the back okay
thank you diego and remember at the end that you need to label label your box
so tell me how do you start this you are using the portrait so i am going to look like this okay tell me what was the 1st step you did the length the length and how many units on the length 1414 okay
so you need to label that right now you just put 14 length is equal 14 and this is what width the width so you put w and the value of the width which is
999 units and the height 1111 so height is 11 now you have the front part and the bottom part of the box
top so you only need to connect those 2 right here part huh and so you need the bottom part and the back part of the box huh whoever finishes 1st i want the person to go and plot those on the board
and tell the class the steps that you followed to plot those points on the grid and what did you find 1st 2nd and 3rd sometimes we use strategies to beginning with the bottom or the top or the front
okay and the width is how many units 99 how many units do you have there you have to count the points 9
okay so i see that carlos is done with the length width and height carlos you want to go over there and plot those points on the grid
did anybody find out already the volume of the box okay almost okay
end let us plot let us find out your box right here so i am going to give you the maybe the point is going to be maybe right here
9 units good for you okay and the height is 1111 width is .
here and so one just try to do the .
as much as you can carlos okay it is right there okay so try to connect it like that okay good for you carlos so the height is
11 units carlos we cannot go more because we are not going to have a space for that
so we have the front and the bottom of our box thank you carlos now who can tell me what is the volume of that
what is the volume the volume is so to get the volume we just have to multiply 14 x 9 x 11 how much is that bryan landaverde 1386
1386 who is agreeing with that okay how did you figure it out sir
much 3630660 it cannot be 9 how much is 4 times 9 times 99 .
31212 so 14 times 9 is a 126 and then you multiply 126 times what 1111 and that would be 6 .
8216211 so you have the same thing okay 1386 that means that means that with those 3 dimensions that box can carry 1386
13086
all right so today we are going to work on playing a really cool game called capture fraction but the object of the game is for you to better understand numerators and denominators so the numerator on a fraction is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom
and to understand what does a numerator mean and what does that do in fraction and denominator what does that mean and what does that mean in a fraction and then today we are going to continue to ask you to identify equivalent fractions who can quickly remind me what are equivalent fractions yeah equal so equal equivalent so fractions that are exactly the same who can quickly give me an example of a equivalent of a set of equivalent fractions yeah
half excellent so we have 24th and a half they are equivalent that means that they are the same they have the same value or they have the same shade and places and then today you are going to put them in order where you compare a fraction and you have to use a series of thinking and thinking about equivalence and relationship to tell me how to understand what is bigger than the other
does that make sense okay so you are going to actually explain while you are playing the game understand what is numerator and denominator share how your strategies and how you figure out how things are equivalent and also explain how you put things in order when you compare fractions
no all right so what i have here is 2 fractions let me erase that 1st okay 14th and 3 fifths in it in the game then what we are going to play is figure out who is bigger which is a larger which is a bigger one okay so you have 14th and 3 fifths which fraction is bigger
so what i would like you to do is turn within your team and talk about what do you think which is bigger 14th or 3 fifths okay so it is 2 see 14th 3 times 4 equals 12 okay so what does that mean shuxian what did he just do
i heard a lot of numbers i know 4 times 3 equals 121 times 5 equals 5 huh so 3 fifths is bigger 3 fifths is bigger is that do you agree that it is is that what you said okay do you agree with it yeah okay so can you tell me if there is another way that you can figure out which one is bigger 4 times okay
idea but i want to go back to to think about what amy just said so she said well you only ate one whereas you ate 3 here but are they the same for each one no so okay think about that would that be a good way to think about well this one ate one this one ate 3 is that a fair way to think about it
0 i know if you cross across the middle it will be 245 but is this one the same so for example if i were to take this one and i apologize my drawing is not very good they are not equivalent they are not equal but if this this one is it the same as much as this one know because the square one that looked like a square but that looked like a rectangle yeah big rectangle okay
if you take one as 15th and you say the denominator is bigger than the it is small okay so you have 15th and then you have 14th so because you had to split more where the denominator is bigger then that is why 15th is actually smaller than 14th so knowing that how so you have to be conscious about that this one and this one are totally different okay good job
what do you guys think 14th i think 14th 14th is bigger because last time you said the bigger number the the smaller pieces you get
when you eat less you get more pieces but when you eat more you get less pieces it is like the denominator it has more you eat less when the denominator is greater you eat more you only have like 2 left and when the denominator is smaller you have more left okay does everyone agree in here
yeah wonderful all right so i heard some interesting way of finding out which one is greater okay so who would like to share with me 1st anthony 3 fifths is bigger how do you know 3 fifths is bigger because 4 times 3 is 12
one so anthony can you come up and show me what you mean by that you want to change it . okay so can you tell me what you did
4 times 3 is 12 and 3 times 5 is 5 like 44 equals one whole and there is 15 and then there is one
okay junhong do you agree with him
yeah then tell me why you would agree with him if you were telling me that he forgot to times to multiply by 5 in here what do you think i think like you skipped me
well what about someone else what do you think because what anthony did is interesting he multiplied 5 times one to make 5 and then 4 times 3 makes 12
he just times the numerator in there but he did not times the denominator okay so he did not need to do if he times the denominator so he did not need to do this one step is that right anthony i mean he changed a step
he changed the value of 14th he just like if he you had to speak a little louder if he times the denominator it would be like it would be the same denominator okay so you are looking for the same denominator so it would be 520 and then the other one would be this and then you would see that since can you tell me that then
since they have the same denominator then you can compare it 0 does that make sense good job thank you all right with someone else with a different strategy how did you figure out whether or not 14th is greater than 3 fifths well there were some interesting things that were happening here 0 suddenly 0 i do not want to talk about it
me you know what since you do not want to talk about it i will bring it up okay so earlier this team were having a very interesting conversation they were talking about well what is left over they are focusing on the left over part and they say and do you want to continue tell me what you just you said no no okay so they were saying that there is a lot more left over versus this
so you have 3 fourths left over and amy how much do you have left over here 2 fifths 2 fifths and she is saying that 3 fourths is greater than 2 fifths then that means yesterday we talked about when you have left over the more you eat the less you have left huh the less you eat the more you have left right
yep when we eat candies or brownies or whatever a huge slice a huge pizza so how much the more you eat the less you have left the less you eat the more you have left but then there was a conversation that you guys you both team had that was a little was quite interesting and we i feel that we should talk about
one some of you are saying well this one ate one and this one ate 3 bigger why is why should it not be that way shuxian because the denominator is not the same the denominator is not the same
same kenny it is not cut into the same pieces it is not cutting into the same pieces job so when the pieces are not the same i could have 14th of something
but if i cut something into 5 pieces and i tell you that i eat all 5 of them even though my denominator is bigger but i actually ate more because i ate more pieces so you can not just rely on looking at the denominator you should also look at the numerator as well does that make sense so there are a couple of ways of thinking about solving figure out how one is bigger than the other
strategy what strategy do you have this one do you do you want me to erase some of them it is this one
he is doing the that is okay you are right on target he is doing the p m g what is p m g
0 okay so kenny can you tell us what you were trying to tell him
no so i i guess okay so tell me how junhong would should draw it then 01 if you try to cut it in 4 to make it equal what should the 1st thing you do
right and then how do we find 14th half of half half of half and then half of half of half so 3 fourths right here it is hard to see when your line is not exactly the same or my square is not exactly the same us so we have the same thing 0 and one
one how many parts do i need to cut it 155 because i have 3 fifths so it is 14th and we need to do 3 fifths so we can not so we know that if i do half right here okay just to keep a gauge as to where things are
so i know that 15th 25th are less than half and 35th is it less or more than half half so you can kind of play with it a little bit and just try to be a little bit try to make sure that it kind of stays within the same amount of increments
here so that can help you to see that 3 fifths is longer than 14th bigger than 14th does that make sense yes okay so that was really good i did not think of that myself all right so there are quite a few ways that you boys and girls can think that up to help you to figure out which is greater so you can do what anthony was doing earlier going to crisscross and that magic rule that you guys like using
denominator that means they share the same denominator so you can compare it about look at what is left to help you to figure out which is greater or you can use a number line to help you to figure out which is greater strategies so that is what we are talking about using the equivalence and the reasoning with equivalence and relationship to help you to figure out which is greater and which is less all right
no okay so today you are going to play a game called capture fraction decks your own deck and your partner has a deck so basically what you are going to do is kind of shuffle the card and you on your 1st do not try to pick some of you are like i am going to try to pick the biggest one down put it that way and then no one is trying to cheat the top card take it out
out and then you have to see who is greater okay if you have a greater like this fraction yeah from the top this way card okay so whoever has the most number of cards on the end wins
ms luis you can if you like on page 33 in unit 6 on page 33 it says finding equivalent fractions when you are there anytime that you find a fraction that is equivalent that means the same thing the same value then you write that down
so for example half is equivalent to 4 eighths then you would write half equals 4 eighths so when you find another fraction set a fraction or that are equivalent then you should write it down to keep track of it now if you happen to have a card that you are equivalent then you both keep your own card okay does that make sense yes okay any question of what you need to do no yes andrew but just we will figure it out
it if your partner does not have his or her cards then yeah if you do not mind splitting it that would be great yeah what if you could just put that in the deck over here at the point that is a good point if you have a card that is equivalent you know what let me see you should get a c d
0 sorry if you have an equivalent card totally lost that the equivalent card so for example shuxian and i have a set of cards that are equivalent she has half i have 48 then we deal another card out 0 that is right sorry my fault does that make sense so if i have half she has a half then it is equivalent then we take out the next card
and if hers is mine is one whole her is 13rd then i win because one whole is bigger than 13rd okay does that make sense any time you find any card that is equivalent write it down any question of what you need to do okay who can tell me what we are going to do do not all raise your hand at the same time andrew shuffle it 1st 1st yeah good and then what yeah like .
someone is talking eyes on the person who is talking like you put one card and your partner put one card if you both have equivalent you keep it
okay you hold on to the card and then what you write it down on your piece of paper and then you fill up another card and see whosever is bigger whoever has is bigger will get all 4 cards 0 right because you have 2 cards that are equivalent and then 2 more cards that are out there all right and whoever has the most cards has more cards at the end will win
now junhong and shuxian are like 0 my goodness i need to write my name on all of them so but i think you kind of recognize your own handwriting i hope but if you can quickly write your initial on your card then that is fine too
that will help a little bit if you are ready let the game begin yay
does tiffany get it yes okay then tiffany explain to us what you how you are doing it if it is equivalent you keep it
but if it is not equivalent then you fill out the next word if it is equivalent then you hold it and then you fill out the next card 0 out that was the whole point of the game then you whoever is greater than all of them does that make sense 0
now make sure you have that conversation with your partner as to how do you know that is greater or less or equivalent 18 i have the biggest one so do i keep it okay put it down so she he can look at it too
yeah 36312 alex are these your cards do you do you split it i can not find mine i will give you a little what like how
0 okay but how do you know that yours is bigger because the denominator is smaller 0 smaller right and the p then the piece you got to pick up
okay what does that mean it means like if you like for example if i like ate 2 so let us use this as an example since you have it right here so 2 thirds and 4 tenths which one is bigger this 123rd why do you think so
because like if i eat like if i eat 2 thirds and 84 tenths 4 tenths would be 84 tenths 4 tenths would be 84 tenths no you you have to 0 yeah more more why not
did even though you have one piece he has one piece but look at this piece it is like this big
one think about how much do you have left 1st you have 13rd left here and 6 tenths left okay now you are really comparing 13rd and 6 tenths now right okay so tell me
how do you know which is greater why 10 we had that concept before so you are doing the crisscross right i hate to write on your card
may i write here so you are doing 13rd and 6 tenths right and then you go 3 tenths and 6 eighteenths and that is why this is bigger right that is just a way to prove it but i need you to understand it what does that mean you can play another round did you find any equivalents 1010 wait 0 no
0202 what do you think 16th okay so let us try it this way all right so you have 13rd left you have 46th left there is 13rd left half of something no okay you have 610 over if you have half of a 10 what would that be
number one we looked at what is left over we said it was 13rd over this is 6 tenths over left over any questions so far
and then we i talked about well i know that 13rd is less than a half half right and 6 tenths i know half of the 10 is 5 and i have 6 of them
that means i have more than half i can actually just erase it and put it right here right all right i have more than half left over so that means the portion that is left over is a lot more that means i ate less right but that is why this is bigger than that
so there were a couple of things we did all together look at what is left over any relationship with half half is a landmark number we love half right we love it
then you have half and then use that to compare and then we reversed it
you guys are doing like magic here all right so try that with the other cards to see if that strategy those strategies work all right or that would be a $5 challenge can you try again yeah hey deanne what is up
no we do not have any points what do you need honey i did not find any no equivalents no okay let us play again then shuffle the card and play again how are we doing over here
yeah 16th equals to 21286th equals to 14th 86th equals to one half interesting and you know and you can prove it right see amy can you prove this one to me i have how do you know 36th equals to 3 because 33 +3 equals to 6
so it is a half so it is equal to okay what do you because the numerator is it is a half of the so it works all the time that way yeah good explain this one to me how is 86th equivalent to one and 14th 0 can i try it
yeah when you are in doubt just draw it out it it is just your luck we do not have to shuffle it again okay shuffle it
okay so tell me what is happening i drew like 46th because this is the denominator excellent so but this is right in the middle so i used another 6 and then i have to color 8 pieces so this is already one whole and this is 2 over 6
0 so in fraction what does this think of 21 and 26th right or you can think of it as 13rd right yeah so you have one whole and 26th or 13rd so this is actually not equivalent 0 but you know what amy
i love this yesterday you were having such a tough time and today you are like this is easy this is easy as pie this is great but we just you know what by drawing it you just proved it right so 86th is not equivalent to one and 14th when you are in doubt draw it out that is right how are you in here too bad
hey i need to hear some conversation going on here people equivalent i am so sad she could not think how to wash my small pot and the small pot can wash it with just milk i am so sad
know she could not look that is why you guys are like speeding through this there is no conversation here i lost 2 so i got all of it
alex i love it but too much say that again i am sorry i was a little distracted she got 20 do not forget these these are yours too
shuxian tell me what is happening i do not even see it aha have a seat 1st foreign language 3 times 2 equals 4 times 2 so 0 yeah okay is there another way to think about it
instead of doing that crisscross like one and 14th 14th and 2 thirds so one and one is 52 thirds now 2 thirds and 14th yeah and so 11 times 3 equals 3 say that again you are like 3 times faster than me 2 times what 2 .
3 times what it is like this yeah but can you just multiply the denominator and then figure out that is the answer what i do not understand why you did that can you explain that to me
me foreign language so times one is 8 i know she took the same thing but i want to see another strategy foreign language foreign language okay i am thinking okay so you used common denominator huh what do you think about that do you use that too when you are finding out the answer no no what you do the crisscross and call it in
yeah 0 i like that way
equivalent 0 sorry they were asking some help there what is up guys going good going good did you want to talk to me about something like we are one of them is the same but then and then we can did you use the strategies that you guys were talking about looking at what is left over and do all that crazy math and then figure it out
yes we have the same thing all the time all the time then you keep flipping it 0 whoever is next is going to get all 6 of them what if we have like the same thing then you have the same thing how is this equivalent explain that to me
i feel like i am never here this this one is equivalent 0 we are looking for equivalent 0
why so do we have the i am just putting like 3 no you need to say take out another card and see who is bigger okay how is this the same though 0 okay because you took the that card out
it which one is bigger sorry he took he is taking all of them 0 you really really do not know tell me what the problem is tell me how will you go how are you going to go about to figure it out
it 0 good all right so excuse me i am working with another group when we are done we will talk to you
in the meantime why do not you you can figure out what think of all the strategies that we talked about can you use one of those to help you to figure out which one is greater 0 i get it
one all right tell me what you are thinking i think can i write it on here 0 yes all right tell me another one
tiffany what do you think okay team one and team 2 i love that you love the game but quiet down a little bit would you
no team 2 and 3 sorry 456
i love how she used the graph paper so that i can actually see it a little easier it is down there too
okay about 2 more minutes boys and girls 1234567891011121314151617181920 all your big numbers are make a total of all your big numbers did you solve the problem good i am happy with my luck today okay so she is doing a number line
0 yes good luck so she has 14th right here where would you put 2 sixths we have 2 eighths right here why because the denominator is less than the 4 but you have 2 of them no but i just put them right here 0 sorry i asked you where 16th is did not i
sorry about that it is like playing cards it is likes playing cards okay good do you see what she did okay so she is using a number line to help her
0 think about what is left over you have half more than half right and here you have half is not it then now you have so you can totally figure it out
one if you are ready eyes on me so i know you are ready thank you team one
thank you . all right okay so most of us are ready so can someone share with me what was your strategy what did you do to help you figure out whether or not your card is bigger than your partner is card
ways one is to put the card in one of the number lines okay so for example i think your card was 14th and 2 sixths right okay so can you come up and tell me what you did please 0 wait a minute you can not sorry you can not be in the camera sorry sorry sorry so can you just tell us what you did
this close and 4 times 2 equals 8 okay and 6 times one equals 6 so i because the the 8 is bigger than 6 so that means 2 sixths is bigger excellent all right way oops thumbs up if you have tried using this strategy while you were working on figuring out who is greater who is not okay good most of you and then the other strategy
the number line i got one number line and i split it into 4 equal parts okay i noticed that you were very good about putting 0 and one earlier so i want to make sure i put that there it is very important to know that and then you split it in 2
so kind of less than 3 fourths so that would be 3 sixths it will be 4 sixths and then a little bit more than 5 sixths am i correct but given my portions are not exactly the same but it should be so and this is 2 sixths so this is how far 2 sixths is
no but again the importance of drawing your portions to try to be the same so that if i draw 14th like this but then if i i am sorry if i do 14th like this and then my 2 sixths is like this well of course 14th will be a lot longer than 2 sixths right here
job okay excellent someone else with a different strategy so we have 2 strategies so we will call it the crisscross how do you spell crisscross c r 0 s s criss cross applesauce and then do we do the number line
one the what times one okay do you want to come up and do it
michael what did junhong do
242 times 4 makes 8 so can you tell me what he is trying to do here he is drawing a line okay you are telling me what he did but can you tell me what is his strategy
that yeah but why is he doing all that work michelle to make the both denominator same 0
so he is looking for the same denominator then he can compare just the numerator okay so that is one strategy to find a common denominator so the same denominator does that make sense yeah that he can just focus on the numerator so another strategy is the common denominator good okay any questions for junhong no
why do not the 3 of us kind of explain what we did right so you have 14th and again the importance of trying to draw the shape the same the same the whole is about the same size so it is easier to see
so well and tiffany and andrew and i we also used a similar actually the same strategy so what do we focus on when you have something like this yeah how many is left focus on the leftover portion so here i have 3 fourths left over and here i have 4 sixths left over okay
and then what okay so why one
wei xin or anyone else she does not just put the 2 of them . all right anyone no one i know we are running out of time so we have 3 fourths left over
over so we talk about the relationship with other fractions so here i know they are going to be upset that i used green but i am going to fill this in i know this is half and this is half what is left over this is the same thing so the one thing that is different that is left is that one whole
sorry this is 16th this is 14th left over now i can compare 14th and 16th because i took care of the half already right they both i took care of that so i do not have to worry about that because they are exactly the same then i have 16th and 14th left now because the numerator is the same then we can go back and think about well one out of 4 pieces one out of 6 pieces
right now then i know that 3 fourths is bigger than 4 sixths so then we go back to that idea the more i ate the less i have left over over so because i have more left over then that means that i must eat less
smaller and since here i have less left over so this must be bigger does that make sense so again thinking about using the relationship you have the fractions have amongst each other part does that make sense okay okay so tomorrow we will have i think we should talk a little bit about more about this strategy
so another strategy is looking at the left overs i like calling them left overs they are like food so they are like left overs right so and the relationship between one fraction to another to help us to figure things out know we always say use what you know to help you solve what you do not know okay any question on this no
cards for those of you who left your fraction cards at home please bring them back tomorrow all right any question no no the 4 strategies we talk about is crisscross you are working on the number line finding the common denominators and focusing on the left overs i think we are pretty most of us are pretty comfortable using the crisscross
i think we should develop focus a little bit more on the other 3 and especially i love this one where we actually the more you are able to manipulate the numbers and the fraction the easier that means that your understanding of fraction is even deeper the number line the number line and you might find one that is most efficient for you fraction so we will continue that conversation tomorrow
