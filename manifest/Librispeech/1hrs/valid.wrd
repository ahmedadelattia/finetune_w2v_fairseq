have i told you about my new play
alexander went over and opened the window for her
come we will have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
lamb would not care a great deal about many of them i fancy
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it is soft and misty see how white the stars are
it is really too warm in this room to sing do not you feel it
they are all sketches made about the villa d este you see
there just in front
how jolly it was being young hilda
for a long time neither hilda nor bartley spoke
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a baby is and she has the same 3 freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bains de mer
he felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
do you remember that 1st walk we took together in paris
there are few changes in the old quarter
those fellows are all very loyal even mainhall
nonsense of course i can not really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
there is nothing else that looks so jolly
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you do not like english cookery
bartley started when hilda rang the little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it is not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mother is
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came in to take away the coffee
when bartley arrived at bedford square on sunday evening marie the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
have you been in paris much these late years
alexander unclenched the 2 hands at his sides
i have not had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
do not i though i am so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
i have managed to save something every year and that with helping my 3 sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
there was watercress soup and sole and a delightful omelet stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and 2 small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow rhone wine of which bartley had always been very fond
i think we did she answered demurely
hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
they asked him to come to see them in chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
thank you but i do not like it so well as this
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
he has been wanting to marry hilda these 3 years and more
after all we were awfully young
it has been on only 2 weeks and i have been half a dozen times already
she saves her hand too she is at her best in the 2nd act
do you know i thought the dance a bit conscious to night for the 1st time
westmere and i were back after the 1st act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
i say sir harry the little girl is going famously to night is not she
he had preconceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics
she considered a moment and then said no i think not though i am glad you ask me
mainhall liked alexander because he was an engineer
he is another who is awfully keen about her let me introduce you
she does not take up with anybody you know
mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him
sir harry towne mister bartley alexander the american engineer
she must care about the theater a great deal more than she used to
irene burgoyne one of her family told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning
it is tremendously well put on too
i should not wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
a little attack of nerves possibly
after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
he was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender barefoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like some one winding through a hilly field
do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
i am glad she is held her own since
one night when he and winifred were sitting together on the bridge he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely and sensible and something utterly wild and daft
when did you come bartley and how did it happen you have not spoken a word
i will do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
i got in about 10 minutes ago
bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hilda is living room
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
it was myself i was defying hilda
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
alexander groaned i meant to but somehow i could not
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
the stop at queenstown the tedious passage up the mersey were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
do not cry do not cry he whispered
we have tortured each other enough for tonight
yes hilda i know that he said simply
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
i get nothing but misery out of either
the world is all there just as it used to be but i can not get at it any more
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
the room was empty when he entered
yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him
bartley bent lower over the fire
but why did not you tell me when you were here in the summer
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
but it is worse now it is unbearable
the sight of you bartley to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
were not you happy then at all
hilda is face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
he took her roughly in his arms do you know what i mean
keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
i must know about you
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
alexander did not sit down
she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
please tell me one thing bartley at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
i understand bartley i was wrong
i can not stand seeing you miserable
she pressed his hand gently in gratitude
i thought it might be sister kate or cousin mike would be happening along
you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know i am cowardly
but i did not know you have only to tell me now
oh bartley what am i to do
hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
the work had to be condensed
it presents like no other of luther is writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ is merits alone
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke 2
much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
it was written in latin
a word should now be said about the origin of luther is commentary on galatians
but the essence of luther is lectures is there
the word of our god shall stand forever
let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
in other words these 3 men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luther is for the general american market will you do it
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think write and teach as i do
he was the last to turn to christ
grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
but we are careless we make light of sin
for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse 3
paul an apostle not of men et cetera
that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god
paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
the call is not to be taken lightly
how may we obtain remission of our sins
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
it spoils one is best work
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
and god the father who raised him from the dead
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
these perverters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
the clause seems superfluous on 1st sight
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
these means cannot be contaminated
however the grace and peace of god will
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins
when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
we look for that reward which eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man
not all the galatians had become perverted
this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
men should not speculate about the nature of god
the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
verse 2
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles
not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for
they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go where the christians are
this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
paul came later and is beneath us
underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
paul sticks to his theme
by his resurrection christ won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
mohammed also speaks highly of christ
he mentions the apostles 1st because they were appointed directly by god
they remain divine regardless of men is opinion
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
why do they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty
paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man
the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
was it not enough to say from god the father
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
experience proves this
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there
the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
and all the brethren which are with me
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
hester could only account for the child is character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
if spoken to she would not speak again
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child is disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
ye may not see his worship now
yea his honorable worship is within but he hath a godly minister or 2 with him and likewise a leech
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the 1st settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor is bond servant a free born englishman but now a 7 years slave
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
on the table in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
come therefore and let us fling mud at them
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
mother cried she i see you here look look
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
we have spoken of pearl is rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or 2 from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
there jap you have caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper is face
is not he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
asked phronsie with her little face close to polly is own
asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of polly is arms and crowding up close to jasper is side
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly is 1st rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
do not mind it polly whispered jasper twas not her fault
every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i have had to get her here too
oh she is always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
now you will stay cried van say polly will not you
she asked impulsively i did not believe you could persuade her father
then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
how did her mother ever let her go
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i will not only i can not thank you
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
oh no jasper i must go by my very own self
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
but polly could not speak and if jasper had not caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
i did not have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped phronsie
the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
how brown you have got since you came home i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard
they think you are proud because you have been away to school or something
that is not much of a job for an athlete here i have been to town and back
please wait for me marie emil coaxed
alexandra lets you sleep late
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson
it is 16 years since john bergson died
his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
i never see lou is scythe over here
she gathered up her reins
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
that will not last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
oh emil
marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
that invitation decided her
and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
i suppose that is the wet season too then
but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
i suppose it is the wet season will you have to cut them too
we never had so many of them in here before
i pray for you but that is not the same as if you prayed yourself
and anyhow there is nothing to understand
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
i wish you were not so restless and did not get so worked up over things she said sadly
marie is face fell under his brooding gaze
marie sighed
oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and school teachery
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
thank you he returned shortly
then all our good times are over
if i feel that way i feel that way
and you never used to be cross to me
just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she was not a little in love with him
it is exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
sometimes i do not want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the 4 corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth
yes do not you
are not you splashed look at the spider webs all over the grass
i do not want to stand around and look on
i want to be doing something on my own account
he dropped a handful into her lap
i can not play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that is what you miss marie
surely you are not thinking of going off there
i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
i can not pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i will not pray not to have them not if i am damned for it
it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
i am sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
oh but i am glad to get this place mowed
i do not know all of them but i know lindens are
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
semon is 2 books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
a further stage is recognition
what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being 5 minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this 1st sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this 1st sense of the word
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
the 1st of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend is face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at 1st sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of 2 remembered events
the behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
i will if timaeus approves i approve
some poems of solon were recited by the boys
9000 years have elapsed since she founded yours and 8000 since she founded ours as our annals record
and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children is story
listen then socrates to a tale of solon is who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man
many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
solon marveled and desired to be informed of the particulars
then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment 1st timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke
the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story
for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic
and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics 1st in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the 1st centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
the dialog is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogs or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the 2 trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object 1st and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato is earlier writings
in the supposed depths of this dialog the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogs
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
the count shook his head
if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
nothing more than you know yourself
she is under sail but she is count timascheff is yacht he was right
my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than 6 miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth is convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
captain servadac hastened towards him
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in
slightly changing her course she 1st struck her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her 2 topsails brigantine and jib
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth is orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
its depth remained invariable still 4 or at most 5 fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
another circumstance was most remarkable
is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from 4 to 5 fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than 2 hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater
there is no fear of that sir
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
ocean reigned supreme
steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth is attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of 2 or 300 fathoms instead of 5 fathoms 5 fathoms
nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment towards the north
the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun
unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper is tales he was matchless
the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zoof is achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
when a private in the 8th cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at 28 years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
no cathedral not even burgos itself could vie with the church at montmartre
it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order
length of service 14 years 3 months and 5 days
sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed
we do not spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops
ben zoof is most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessantly were servadac is ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this 18th arrondissement of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
a reconciliation between the 2 conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the 1st place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer is good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the 2nd remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
