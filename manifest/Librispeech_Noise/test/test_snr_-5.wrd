have i told you about my new play
alexander went over and opened the window for her
come we will have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
lamb would not care a great deal about many of them i fancy
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it is soft and misty see how white the stars are
it is really too warm in this room to sing do not you feel it
they are all sketches made about the villa d este you see
there just in front
how jolly it was being young hilda
for a long time neither hilda nor bartley spoke
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a baby is and she has the same 3 freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bains de mer
he felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
do you remember that 1st walk we took together in paris
there are few changes in the old quarter
those fellows are all very loyal even mainhall
nonsense of course i can not really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
there is nothing else that looks so jolly
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you do not like english cookery
bartley started when hilda rang the little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it is not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mother is
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came in to take away the coffee
when bartley arrived at bedford square on sunday evening marie the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
have you been in paris much these late years
alexander unclenched the 2 hands at his sides
i have not had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
do not i though i am so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
i have managed to save something every year and that with helping my 3 sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
there was watercress soup and sole and a delightful omelet stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and 2 small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow rhone wine of which bartley had always been very fond
i think we did she answered demurely
hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
they asked him to come to see them in chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
thank you but i do not like it so well as this
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
he has been wanting to marry hilda these 3 years and more
after all we were awfully young
it has been on only 2 weeks and i have been half a dozen times already
she saves her hand too she is at her best in the 2nd act
do you know i thought the dance a bit conscious to night for the 1st time
westmere and i were back after the 1st act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
i say sir harry the little girl is going famously to night is not she
he had preconceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics
she considered a moment and then said no i think not though i am glad you ask me
mainhall liked alexander because he was an engineer
he is another who is awfully keen about her let me introduce you
she does not take up with anybody you know
mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him
sir harry towne mister bartley alexander the american engineer
she must care about the theater a great deal more than she used to
irene burgoyne one of her family told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning
it is tremendously well put on too
i should not wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
a little attack of nerves possibly
after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
he was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender barefoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like some one winding through a hilly field
do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
i am glad she is held her own since
one night when he and winifred were sitting together on the bridge he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely and sensible and something utterly wild and daft
when did you come bartley and how did it happen you have not spoken a word
i will do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
i got in about 10 minutes ago
bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hilda is living room
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
it was myself i was defying hilda
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
alexander groaned i meant to but somehow i could not
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
the stop at queenstown the tedious passage up the mersey were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
do not cry do not cry he whispered
we have tortured each other enough for tonight
yes hilda i know that he said simply
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
i get nothing but misery out of either
the world is all there just as it used to be but i can not get at it any more
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
the room was empty when he entered
yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him
bartley bent lower over the fire
but why did not you tell me when you were here in the summer
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
but it is worse now it is unbearable
the sight of you bartley to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
were not you happy then at all
hilda is face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
he took her roughly in his arms do you know what i mean
keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
i must know about you
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
alexander did not sit down
she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
please tell me one thing bartley at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
i understand bartley i was wrong
i can not stand seeing you miserable
she pressed his hand gently in gratitude
i thought it might be sister kate or cousin mike would be happening along
you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know i am cowardly
but i did not know you have only to tell me now
0 bartley what am i to do
hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
the work had to be condensed
it presents like no other of luther is writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ is merits alone
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke 2
much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
it was written in latin
a word should now be said about the origin of luther is commentary on galatians
but the essence of luther is lectures is there
the word of our god shall stand forever
let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
in other words these 3 men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luther is for the general american market will you do it
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think write and teach as i do
he was the last to turn to christ
grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
but we are careless we make light of sin
for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse 3
paul an apostle not of men et cetera
that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god
paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
the call is not to be taken lightly
how may we obtain remission of our sins
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
it spoils one is best work
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
and god the father who raised him from the dead
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
these perverters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
the clause seems superfluous on 1st sight
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
these means cannot be contaminated
however the grace and peace of god will
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins
when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
we look for that reward which eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man
not all the galatians had become perverted
this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
men should not speculate about the nature of god
the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
verse 2
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles
not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for
they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go where the christians are
this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
paul came later and is beneath us
underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
paul sticks to his theme
by his resurrection christ won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
mohammed also speaks highly of christ
he mentions the apostles 1st because they were appointed directly by god
they remain divine regardless of men is opinion
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
why do they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty
paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man
the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
was it not enough to say from god the father
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
experience proves this
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there
the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
and all the brethren which are with me
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
hester could only account for the child is character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
if spoken to she would not speak again
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child is disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
ye may not see his worship now
yea his honorable worship is within but he hath a godly minister or 2 with him and likewise a leech
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the 1st settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor is bond servant a free born englishman but now a 7 years slave
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
on the table in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
come therefore and let us fling mud at them
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
mother cried she i see you here look look
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
we have spoken of pearl is rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or 2 from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
there jap you have caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper is face
is not he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
asked phronsie with her little face close to polly is own
asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of polly is arms and crowding up close to jasper is side
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly is 1st rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
do not mind it polly whispered jasper twas not her fault
every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i have had to get her here too
0 she is always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
now you will stay cried van say polly will not you
she asked impulsively i did not believe you could persuade her father
then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
how did her mother ever let her go
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i will not only i can not thank you
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
0 no jasper i must go by my very own self
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
but polly could not speak and if jasper had not caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
i did not have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
0 you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped phronsie
the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
how brown you have got since you came home i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard
they think you are proud because you have been away to school or something
that is not much of a job for an athlete here i have been to town and back
please wait for me marie emil coaxed
alexandra lets you sleep late
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson
it is 16 years since john bergson died
his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
i never see lou is scythe over here
she gathered up her reins
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
that will not last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
0 emil
marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
that invitation decided her
and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
i suppose that is the wet season too then
but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
i suppose it is the wet season will you have to cut them too
we never had so many of them in here before
i pray for you but that is not the same as if you prayed yourself
and anyhow there is nothing to understand
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
i wish you were not so restless and did not get so worked up over things she said sadly
marie is face fell under his brooding gaze
marie sighed
0 ever so much only he seems kind of staid and school teachery
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
thank you he returned shortly
then all our good times are over
if i feel that way i feel that way
and you never used to be cross to me
just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she was not a little in love with him
it is exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
sometimes i do not want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the 4 corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth
yes do not you
are not you splashed look at the spider webs all over the grass
i do not want to stand around and look on
i want to be doing something on my own account
he dropped a handful into her lap
i can not play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that is what you miss marie
surely you are not thinking of going off there
i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
i can not pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i will not pray not to have them not if i am damned for it
it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
i am sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
0 but i am glad to get this place mowed
i do not know all of them but i know lindens are
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
semon is 2 books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
a further stage is recognition
what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being 5 minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this 1st sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this 1st sense of the word
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
the 1st of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend is face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at 1st sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of 2 remembered events
the behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
i will if timaeus approves i approve
some poems of solon were recited by the boys
9000 years have elapsed since she founded yours and 8000 since she founded ours as our annals record
and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children is story
listen then socrates to a tale of solon is who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man
many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
solon marveled and desired to be informed of the particulars
then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment 1st timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke
the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story
for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic
and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics 1st in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the 1st centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
the dialog is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogs or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the 2 trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object 1st and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato is earlier writings
in the supposed depths of this dialog the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogs
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
the count shook his head
if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
nothing more than you know yourself
she is under sail but she is count timascheff is yacht he was right
my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than 6 miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth is convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
captain servadac hastened towards him
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in
slightly changing her course she 1st struck her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her 2 topsails brigantine and jib
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth is orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
its depth remained invariable still 4 or at most 5 fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
another circumstance was most remarkable
is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from 4 to 5 fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than 2 hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater
there is no fear of that sir
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
ocean reigned supreme
steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth is attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of 2 or 300 fathoms instead of 5 fathoms 5 fathoms
nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment towards the north
the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun
unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper is tales he was matchless
the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zoof is achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
when a private in the 8th cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at 28 years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
no cathedral not even burgos itself could vie with the church at montmartre
it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order
length of service 14 years 3 months and 5 days
sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed
we do not spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops
ben zoof is most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessantly were servadac is ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this 18th arrondissement of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
a reconciliation between the 2 conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the 1st place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer is good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the 2nd remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into 2 classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women is dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accouterments and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these 2 groups coincide
each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
the dependent who was 1st delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
the question is which of the 2 methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household is pecuniary decency
in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
well if i do not know who she was in love with i know who he was
he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
missus griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
you are acute
who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply 0 i can not wait for the story the story will not tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more is the pity then
she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
to this his answer was prompt 0 thank god no and is the record yours
she was the most agreeable woman i have ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
will not you tell douglas
it was the beauty of it
the departing ladies who had said they would stay did not of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
the 1st of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the 3rd of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the 4th
yes but that is just the beauty of her passion
it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition which was
the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me
the story is written
it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay
i do not anticipate
you will easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
she sent me the pages in question before she died
there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
he hung fire again a woman is
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
someone else told a story not particularly effective which i saw he was not following
it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
probably not till the 2nd post
it was not simply that she said so but that i knew she had not i was sure i could see
she has been dead these 20 years
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art
thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time is leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of either is woe
ay me
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierc would with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies
no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth remov would from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah
so i return rebuk would to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steel would sense or changes right or wrong
love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow
but reckoning time whose 1000000 would accidents creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp saint intents divert strong minds to the course of altering things alas why fearing of time is tyranny might i not then say now i love you best when i was certain 0 er incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest
0 tis the 1st tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poison would tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth 1st begin

it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purposed of cookery
uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withes
bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
4 or 5 of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
god bless you friend i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count 6 and this singer is as good as nothing
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other is features is he afraid
can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared
if you are not then knocked on the head your being a non composser will protect you and you will then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam is ass to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear is singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
well what can not be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
in his return to the camp his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
will the hurons hear his groans
so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
extinguished brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion
run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer is foot
a circle of a few 100 feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
the examination however resulted in no discovery
since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
yet here are we within a short range of the scaroons and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey

another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows up stairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage the mistress hit her a heavy slap knocked her out of the window and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
of starting i did not know the way to come
she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community

as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert hollan no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthralment while under hollan will hardly ever be forgotten

our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
but now nothing could hold me back
1000s of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
there was good reason to stop and think even for the world is most emotionless man
the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
one of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
we are leaving on the abraham lincoln
even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
we do not know where it will take us
he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the 3rd person to the point where it got tiresome
3 seconds before the arrival of j b hobson is letter i no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
but we are going just the same
please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting i had turned 40
a route slightly less direct that is all
conseil i called a 3rd time conseil appeared
departing from 500000 throats 3 cheers burst forth in succession
i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
we have a commander who is game for anything
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess
pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks do not bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
you see my friend it is an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale
chapter 3 as master wishes
did master summon me he said entering
not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey
yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
we will be quite comfortable here i told conseil
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or 2
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
we will deal with them later what
conseil was my manservant
and yet what a fine gallant lad
for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
what then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond
i awoke to consciousness fighting at 1st it seemed as if i was fighting with a phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffar
no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored
my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
a sound of voices a flash of light
perchance too kaffar is death might serve him in good stead
a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
i had again been acting under the influence of this man is power
it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
what was that
i do not know i am dazed bewildered
my position was too terrible
i remember saying have we been together
onward said a distant voice
i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffar his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of 10 men and i hurled him from me
no sound broke the stillness of the night
voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it
i know he had it this very evening
my overwrought nerves yielded at last
said another voice which i recognized as voltaire is kaffar
i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
but that is kaffar is knife
but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion
and my pocket money is getting low again and you have not any left as usual
they worry me terribly and besides i would like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme cyn
surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
is not he the greatest for getting into odd corners
they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world
yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
goliath makes another discovery
smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit
forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
now let us dust the furniture and pictures
this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
hers happened to be in the same frame too but she evidently did not care about that
the twin brother did something she did not like and she turned his picture to the wall
he makes it sort of cozier
the poor little things cried cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
then she suddenly remarked
now what was the sense of it 2 innocent babies like that
the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthia is delight when she caught sight of him
they were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem
0 let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house
what in the world is that queried joyce
why it is goliath as usual they both cried peering in
it can not hurt anything i am sure for we will not disturb things at all
now what have you to say cynthia sprague
we will come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning
do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing
i thought we were stumped again when i 1st saw that picture but it has been of some use after all
well i am convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april 16th 1861 and probably not much later
the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
the english forwarded to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
in those very terms i even added more
she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened before them
from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by 2 or 3 she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
i can perceive love clearly enough
bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the 2 lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
it is you who are mistaken raoul i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
concord returned to its place amidst the tents
congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
but in this friendly pressure raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
you will be frank with me i always am
i am convinced of what i say said the count
the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
but continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
yes i need repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
it is annoyance then
can you imagine why buckingham has been so violent i suspect
thus it is that the honor of 3 is saved our country is our master is and our own
why should i rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because i am a girl
what a box women are put into measured for it and put in young if we go anywhere it is in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world is people
but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
does thee think thee could stand it 6 months
mother i am going to study medicine
i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
and thee will not go why should i
and besides suppose thee does learn medicine
margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest
he does not say but it is on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wednesday meeting humph it was time for him to do something
ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
she tried this morning an air or 2 upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philip is letter
i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who 1st made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
if i can get patients
if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in germantown where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves
and if i had a fortune would thee want me to lead a useless life
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him
it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
i will practice it
but philip is honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way
father thee is unjust to philip he is going into business
i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
has thee consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career thee wants
where thee and thy family are known
thee study medicine
ruth sat quite still for a time with face intent and flushed it was out now
is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kick a poos
i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
he does not say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it is something about land and railroads and thee knows father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
the sight seers returned in high spirits from the city
it is such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there is the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
but neither saint girard nor broad street neither wonders of the mint nor the glories of the hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on 8th street
and then there was broad street
she was tired of other things
thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
philip therefore read diligently in the astor library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
no its not too soon
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever
he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself
sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region where the date palm grows and the nightingale is voice is in tune and the bul bul sings on the off nights
i have been ready to go anywhere for 6 months
i was afraid it was nearer home
to the young american here or elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
he wanted to begin at the top of the ladder
the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skillful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of lieutenant strain or doctor kane
well i am going as an engineer you can go as one
he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
law seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante room of the law office where he was writing philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends
0 very well said gringo turning away with a shade of contempt you will find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can not afford a conscience like that
but philip did afford it and he wrote thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
you will never dig it out of the astor library
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
the 2 young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the wall street office of henry is uncle and had a talk with that wily operator
why it is in missouri somewhere on the frontier i think we will get a map
you can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures
and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction
there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along
certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt
far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it
you will take them from my private treasure
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful
he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the 2 courtiers
yes it is suppressed
ah very well
the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
your majesty is plan then in this affair is
suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the king seemed only pleased with every one present
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at 50 clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
sire he said your majesty is most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition
the king had completed his toilette by 90 clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
gentlemen to your posts whereupon saint aignan and villeroy took their leave
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theater shook with tumultuous applause
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
what do you mean inquired louis
how is it la valliere said mademoiselle de tonnay charente that the vicomte de bragelonne spoke of you as louise
every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed
do you think so she replied with indifference
i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish
yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love any one
explain yourself
it seems the king will not consent to it
let us run then said all 3 and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park
well said mademoiselle de tonnay charente i also think a good deal but i take care
the young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed invisible
the princess inquired no
upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart
i allude to the goddess
there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
indeed ah
remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
0 i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king is i suppose is it not louise
0 mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
you are positive then
it is too difficult replied mademoiselle de tonnay charente laughing loudly
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
no more than the dancing
she was here just now said the count
what already here they said to her
good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind
in this way the fete of the whole court was a fete also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me
to say nothing said montalais so that when mademoiselle de tonnay charente thinks athenais is the only one who knows it
forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a 1000 times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain
i have been here this quarter of an hour replied la valliere
i give my consent
la valliere is quite a poetess said tonnay charente
did not the dancing amuse you no
yes but perhaps i frightened her in what way
quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop athenais you are so tall
in fact the sound of madame is and the queen is carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mounted cavaliers
it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
but how did she manage to render it so fashionable
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of silvia 10 years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor silvia dies
all these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
simply by stopping her carriage 2 or 3 times before the shop to have her snuff box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
silvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marivaux for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
yes but the meridian of the palais royal is the most exact
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself an illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
what sir i said to him am i fortunate enough to see you
she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them
i tell him to give me some coffee if it is good
it is sold everywhere but for the last 3 weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the civet cat
you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the 1st case it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people and in the 2nd fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of wit
i never had any family
her face was an enigma for it inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
i see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
i will make you translate them into french and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him
i shall call you esprit
madam corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word scevra which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced sceura and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the 1st day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
to celebrate the arrival of her son silvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty repartees and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least 20 cats with which he would amuse himself all day
for the 1st day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
at your service sir
i address him in italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
madame quinson besides can answer your enquiries
2 years before her death i saw her perform the character of marianne in the comedy of marivaux and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
my remark pleases him but i soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer
i sit down at a small table a waiter comes immediately to enquire my wishes
here go and get me change for a louis i have it sir
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still and looking up
he himself recited the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbe conti and i had occasion to quote 2 lines of that profound writer
she was honorably buried in the church of saint sauveur without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christain intolerancy of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was the common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the savior of all mankind
is it better than anywhere else
i thank him and take my leave
you do me a great honor
silvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
is there not a meridian everywhere
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out vive le roi
that is true badauderie
then turning towards me he says that i look like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian he begins to speak to me of the court of the city of the theaters and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
i reside in the marais rue de douze portes
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
you have not seen any of them no sir
holmes held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
i was absent rather more than an hour
then he tossed it down and seized the next
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
so it seems to me
0 i would not venture to say sir
the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
the top floor belongs to miles mc laren
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for 10 years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
i understand you to say that there are 3 students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
a broken tip of lead was lying there also
holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa what is this
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
now mister soames at your disposal
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
above were 3 students one on each story
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door
i really do not think he knew much about it mister holmes
the proof was in 3 long slips i had left them all together
let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs
he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
mister soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
i dare not go so far as that but of the 3 he is perhaps the least unlikely
did you look at these papers on the table
but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
how came you to leave the key in the door
and they are all in for this examination yes
watson i have always done you an injustice there are others
only for a minute or so
anyone in the room could get out yes sir
then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
my friend is temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
on the palm were 3 little pyramids of black doughy clay
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
just close the door said holmes
you know him i think so
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
there was no man sir
and one more this morning
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
when i approached your room i examined the window
he is the one with the worst record
i have a letter here mister soames which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
that is very important said holmes
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
gloves said the young man
it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
you do not seem to realize the position
no sir certainly not
we want to know mister gilchrist how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
look at that he held out his hand
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
if mister soames saw them the game was up
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
no one less than that would have a chance
he could examine the papers in his own office
yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
he put his shoes on the table
well well do not trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
i think so you have formed a conclusion
have i told the truth mister gilchrist
to morrow is the examination
no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrist is door
the foul mouthed fellow at the top
the indian i also thought nothing of
no good my dear watson
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
why banister the servant what is his game in the matter
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes
of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with 2 eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
no i have made up my mind about it if i am mabel i will stay down here
i will try if i know all the things i used to know
i am very tired of swimming about here 0 mouse
and i declare it is too bad that it is
i am so very tired of being all alone here
and how odd the directions will look
i wonder if i have been changed in the night
it will be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
0 will not she be savage if i have kept her waiting
poor alice
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
and yesterday things went on just as usual
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
we will not talk about her any more if you would rather not we indeed
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i shall never get to 20 at that rate
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came 0 the duchess the duchess
i wish i had not cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
is the atmospheric condition having once reached this density to become final
here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine horrible
but if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose which at the 1st shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment
from time to time a fleecy tuft of mist with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of gray and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass
the waves rise above our heads
he nods his consent
that will be safest no no never
the piled up vapors condense into water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists rouses itself into a whirlwind
i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
the roarings become lost in the distance
the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters
the fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a 10 inch shell moved slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
at noon the violence of the storm redoubles
there is a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
hans stirs not
the raft bears on still to the south east
they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
we suffer stifling pains
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
the atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
on the mast already i see the light play of a lambent saint elmo is fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
the weather if we may use that term will change before long
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
the air is heavy the sea is calm
saturday august 15th the sea unbroken all round no land in sight
sunday august 16th
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
truly this sea is of infinite width
i take this as my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains
nothing new weather unchanged the wind freshens
during his watch i slept
it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not
he called this sea a pond and our long voyage taking a little sail
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water
i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide
2 monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are 2 reptiles of the primitive world
those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity
we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of 20 fathoms
i suppose professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep
i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
there is a whale a whale cried the professor
therefore do not talk to me about views and prospects
2 hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
but there seemed no reason to fear
as for the ichthyosaurus has he returned to his submarine cavern
one might be with less reason than now
the horizon seems extremely distant
its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists it is armed with no less than 182 teeth
tuesday august 18th
i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures 30 feet in length
i can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a man is head
put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out
i expect you have been a very good girl andella since you were here last
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
i am very glad
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
you have come andella andella was the name of jane is doll to make rosalie a visit
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor
said she pointing to the playthings see
della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane
now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and do not say a word to them
without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresses upon the mind
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
nature of the effect produced by early impressions
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
that is comparatively nothing
anders face grew red
so it is said anders
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off
and she took anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every 3rd step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
but anders cared nothing about that
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife
with one jump anders got out of his chair
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king is golden crown he said that anders was a stupid
seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king
no my little son she said
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows
and it is made of mother is best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
he only shook his head
i am going to the court ball answered anders
yes why not thought anders
but his mother hugged him close
that is a very fine cap you have he said
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother is cottage
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
he darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
as the chaise drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury
the mother as soon as the chaise is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
by reason and affection
the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
the 3 modes of management
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly will not you
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated
had eva crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace
then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him
and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando
we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
your power is sufficient i said
missus neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
of what missus neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
their masters said missus neverbend
if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleaxe here at this time to morrow we will stretch a and delay the departure of the john bright for 24 hours
you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her
i did not mean said captain battleaxe to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion
you hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleaxe
but what is the delicate mission i asked
jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
then there were 3 or 4 leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
i and my wife and son and the 2 craswellers and 3 or 4 others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
0 yes said jack and i am nowhere
this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you
the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail
what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinando
you propose to kidnap me i said
thinking of all this i went to sleep
the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency is knowledge
sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore
my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner
you will carry out with you 100 men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
they of course must all be altered
on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
what could i do now but just lay myself down and die
it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
that is all quite true mister neverbend said sir ferdinando brown
when do you intend that the john bright shall start
jack would become eva is happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
the letter ran as follows
when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
but i mean to have my innings before long
mister neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula
but in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
we are quite satisfied now captain battleaxe said my wife
i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
it is a duty said i
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
quite satisfied said eva
to day i shouted
you may be quite sure it is there said captain battleaxe and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within 2 minutes of my return on board
how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
and the death of which i dreamt could not alas
ho ye sails that seem to wander in dream filled meadows say is the shore where i stand the only field of struggle or are ye hit and battered out there by waves and wind gusts as ye tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
brighter than early dawn is most brilliant dye are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meet to break and foam like rainbow veils upon a bubble is dome
he had got into her courtyard
he had broken into her courtyard
that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark
over the track lined city street the young men the grinning men pass
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cypress trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
old dances are simplified of their yearning bleached by time
while the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming its soft strong blaze calm in the early evening glow
venice
she was alone that night
the pity that we must come and go
through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached king is galley whose sails are furled who is hung with tapestries rich and old
guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only music one another is breath through gardens intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burn between the rocks by pools where birches bend to confidants above green waters scummed with lily plants
then he rushed down stairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured
then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices
why you said to fetch the 1st living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat is horns
the idea of patching cap n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
fine glorious
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
but cap n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
i had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife
at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment
the goat is warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they are nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs they have both got the same style of whiskers and they are both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
the captain shook his head
mornin girls hope ye feel as well as ye look
i would not mind a cup 0 coffee myself said cap n bill i have had consid ble exercise this mornin and i am all ready for breakfas
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing
in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and 6 smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubnosed princesses
suppose it is a friend
hold him fast my men and as soon as i have had my coffee and oatmeal i will take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
i could not shiver much bein bound so tight but when i am loose i mean to have jus one good shiver to relieve my feelin is
before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
come and get the boolooroo she said going toward the benches
control yourselves my dears replied the boolooroo the worst punishment i know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
when he finished she said cheerfully
when 1st they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
you are mate replied the sailor
then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them
so ghip ghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
it will be such a satisfaction
scuse me said trot i neglected to tell you that you are not the boolooroo any more
now then let us enter the city an enjoy the grand feast that is being cooked i am nearly starved myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work
i will not be wicked any more sighed the old boolooroo i will reform
the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and cap n bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
do not worry sizzle dear it will all come right pretty soon
since last thursday i ghip ghisizzle have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trot i suppose i am conquered too and you have no boolooroo at all
when the blueskins saw ghip ghisizzle they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
i will gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and i will feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
the former boolooroo groaned
at the head of the pinkies were ghip ghisizzle and button bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by captain coralie and captain tintint and rosalie the witch
that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited
it was through floyd is advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
what the latter day saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
and so the story of mormonism runs on its finale has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
federal judges and united states attorneys in utah who were not mormons nor lovers of mormonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy
we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth of parent and child brother and sister husband and wife
they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men and arms for their country is need
this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment and a fine of $300 a man might be imprisoned for life aye for many terms of a man is natural life did the court is power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined 1000000s of dollars
already a north and a south were talked of why not set up also a west
in 1862 a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there meet with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentences of many years duration
it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the maligned mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished
but a word further concerning the expedition in general
then the church was disincorporated and its property both real and personal confiscated and escheated to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court is receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
at the inception of plural marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practice
the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor boggs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about 70 stakes of zion and about 700 organized wards each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations
the lieutenant governor lilburn w boggs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested sympathy with the persecutors
soon 1000s of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri independence jackson county being their center but from the 1st they were unpopular among the missourians
the 1st well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of kirtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the 1st temple of modern times
the practice of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
instead of but 6 regularly affiliated members and at most 2 score of adherents the organization numbers today many 100000 souls
its origin was small a germ an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
a small settlement had been founded by mormon families on shoal creek and here on the 30th of october 1838 a company of 240 fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score
0 what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact
making their way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in caldwell county therein founding the city of far west
their eyes were from the 1st turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
american school boys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butchery and of the vaudois hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
it is notable that the indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favor seeing in the book of mormon striking agreement with their own traditions
to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply a church building a house for religious assembly
be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with the terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery
nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe
as a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the missourians i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march 16th 1839
the book of mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
who began the quarrel was it the mormons
on the 6th of april 1830 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formally organized and thus took on a legal existence
the cloud then shewd his golden head and his bright form emerg would
she ceasd and smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine
why fades the lotus of the water
image of weakness art thou but a worm
why a tongue impress would with honey from every wind
the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lillys leaf and the bright cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale
why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
till we arise link would in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
descend 0 little cloud and hover before the eyes of thel
or an eye of gifts and graces showring fruits and coined gold
but thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair eyed dew to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun
why should the mistress of the vales of har utter a sigh
i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mothers smiles
and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales they why should thel complain
and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more
to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of adona her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew
thel is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face
and why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air
lives not alone nor or itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
0 little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away then we shall seek thee but not find ah thel is like to thee
0 life of this our spring
which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
the lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass answerd the lovely maid and said i am a watry weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou new born lily flower
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot
like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
why fade these children of the spring
0 love 0 troth
all is said without a word
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear
i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life is star foretold
slow to world greetings quick with its 0 list when the angels speak
then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim is staff gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled
and love be false
i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
mussulmans and giaours throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping
nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gild the onward path and feared to overlean a finger even
open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that 1st kiss
i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood is faith
that was the chrism of love which love is own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the 3rd upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an unaverred yet prodigal inward joy
0 to shoot my soul is full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
in a few days an officer came with a requisition from governor shannon and took the prisoner by land to westport and afterwards from there to kansas city and leavenworth
relocated footnote governor robinson being on his way east the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at lexington missouri
little by little however the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws
the free state hotel a stone building in dimensions 50 by 70 feet 3 stories high and handsomely furnished previously occupied only for lodging rooms on that day for the 1st time opened its table accommodations to the public and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion
private persons who had leased the free state hotel vainly besought the various authorities to prevent the destruction of their property
his reception speech at westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors
the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
the bogus legislature numbered 36 members
this was a formidable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice
this was at the march election 1855
the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislature the bogus laws the courts the militia officers the president and the army
that summer is emigration however being mainly from the free states greatly changed the relative strength of the 2 parties
in the early morning of the next day may 20 ninth a company of dragoons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pro slavery men still slept the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to lecompton in the charge of officers of the united states army
he continued his pretended search and to give color to his errand made 2 arrests
coming by way of the missouri river towns he fell 1st among border ruffian companionship and influences and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his washington instructions his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause
from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scouting parties finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands half partisan half predatory
their distinctive characters however display one broad and unfailing difference
footnote sumner to shannon may 12th 1856
all dissent all non compliance all hesitation all mere silence even were in their stronghold towns like leavenworth branded as abolitionism declared to be hostility to the public welfare and punished with proscription personal violence expulsion and frequently death
the whole proceeding was so childish the miserable plot so transparent the outrage so gross as to bring disgust to the better class of border ruffians who were witnesses and accessories
in this incident contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions the emigrant aid society of massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication
sheriff jones had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution but was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright
one of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharps rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort leavenworth
as he had promised to protect the hotel the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears
10 days were consumed in these negotiations but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield
but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws
the inmates being removed at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls
atchison who had been haranguing the mob planted his 2 guns before the building and trained them upon it
to their sorrow they were soon undeceived
for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal while on extraordinary occasions the 2000 border ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state line could at any time easily turn the scale
the incident was not violent nor even dramatic no posse was summoned no further effort made and reeder fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
he summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse who followed obeyed and assisted him
the military force partly rabble partly organized had meanwhile moved into the town
in the shooting of sheriff jones in lawrence and in the refusal of ex governor beeder to allow the deputy marshal to arrest him they discovered grave offenses against the territorial and united states laws
here he was placed in the custody of captain martin of the kickapoo rangers who proved a kind jailer and materially assisted in protecting him from the dangerous intentions of the mob which at that time held leavenworth under a reign of terror
half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance he gave the proprietors until 50 clock to remove their families and personal property from the free state hotel
several 100 free state men promptly responded to the summons
the present chapters can only touch upon the more salient movements of the civil war in kansas which happily were not sanguinary if however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and loss of life for opinion is sake
it was in fact the best weapon of its day
of the lynchings the mobs and the murders it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details
the free state men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
all the territorial dignitaries were present governor shannon presided john calhoun the surveyor general made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionists supporting the topeka movement chief justice lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks
captain martin said i shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst
the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce kansas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities
he planted a company before the hotel and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the free state military companies
to embarrass this damaging exposure judge lecompte issued a writ against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
fortunately said mister vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
why should he not be as other men
but we are not er exactly welcomed
but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate
as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mister and missus vanderpool mister harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
the honorable charles smith miss sarah is brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easterly is wall street office and his face was pale
but you believe in some education asked mary taylor
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus gray is private ear later
missus gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sister is eyes
might learn something useful down there
cotton she paused
better go he had counseled sententiously
miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remark seemed called for
john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms
some others too big cotton county
there might be a bit of poetry here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
the golden fleece it is the silver fleece he harkened
some time you will tell me please will not you
she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight
i suppose though it is too early for them then came the explosion
do not know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally born in cotton and 0 well as much as to ask what is the use she turned again to go
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
you ought to know john if i teach negroes i will scarcely see much of people in my own class
goobers do not grow on the tops of vines but underground on the roots like yams is that so
so for the 100th time she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
at any rate i say go
but john there is no society just elementary work
here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
in the debate between the senior societies her defense of the 15th amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
find some cresswells there big plantations rated at $250000
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
been looking up tooms county
she had been born within its borders within its borders she had lived and grown and within its borders she had met her love
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
the world was water veiled in mists
for one long moment he paused stupid agape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree
where was the use of imagining
on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her
the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy
he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimly made
the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed
ah the swamp the cruel swamp
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
she was so strange and human a creature
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
it was the 1st great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built around it
the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst to bolls
he gazed about perplexed astonished
the lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago and now
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
the years of the days of her dying were 10
the chair was empty but he knew
he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not
up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed
he knew the silver fleece his and zora is must be ruined
she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl round her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost zora
dear me what a chatterbox you are getting to be unc remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
no i forgot all about the brains exclaimed the woman
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
the wizard of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and i am told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is merely the assistant of the great sorceress
gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
she ran to her husband is side at once and helped him lift the 4 kettles from the fire
ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margolotte had 1st made the girl is form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
asked the voice in scornful accents
ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
i now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
it truly is asserted the magician
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it all together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins the path divided
his hat had a peaked crown and a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he 1st made to old mombi the witch who used to live in the country of the gillikins to the north of here
at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color
then they started on again and 2 hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipt
i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
but 1st i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes
that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in a sympathetic tone
i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boy is astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
we are traveling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
i am afraid i do not know much about the land of oz
when they were outside unc simply latched the door and started up the path
we have come from a far lonelier place than this a lonelier place
the 1st lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung 4 kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
the woman seemed thoughtful
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
he wore blue silk stockings blue knee pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
you see i have lived all my life with unc nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest
but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in numidia their superior numbers and 400 bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline
bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the donatists
i swan to man he ejaculated if you do not work hard you can not keep up with the times doctor of laws
she is wonderful more wonderful than anybody we have ever seen anywhere and she draws better than the teacher in charlestown
he would not search so do not worry replied cyril quietly and the 2 looked at each other and knew that it was so
mister popham laid down his brush
yes dead these 4 years an a good job for her too
she makes effort after effort trembling with eagerness and when she fails to reproduce what she sees she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment
grandfather was alexander carey l l d doctor of laws that is

olive is mournful black eyes met nancy is sparkling brown ones
he give up his position and shut the family up in that tomb of a house so t he could study his books
well as i say it is an awful queer world they clap all the burglars into jail and the murderers and the wife beaters i have allers thought a gentle reproof would be enough punishment for a wife beater cause he probably has a lot 0 provocation that nobody knows and the firebugs can not think 0 the right name something like cendenaries an the breakers 0 the peace an what not an yet the law has nothin to say to a man like hen lord
mister popham exaggerated nothing but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the house of lords
she is wild to know how to do things
there in the cedar hollow then lived olive lord an angry resentful little creature weighed down by a fierce sense of injury
they could not run nor move they are just pasteboard
whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas
he keeps the thou shalt not commandments 1st rate hen lord does

what can you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously
miss woodley was too little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union
to ask any more questions of you i believe would be unfair
again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffectually as before
but the more forgetfulness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
but in such a case miss milner is election of a husband shall not direct mine
miss milner is health is not good
said missus horton a few minutes after
0 my lord cried miss woodley with a most forcible accent you are the last person on earth she would pardon me for entrusting
not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
and yet you must own her behavior has warranted them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable
is she not afraid that i will thwart her inclinations
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts a vivacity in her conversation and withal a softness in her demeanor that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
so there is to me added sandford with a sarcastic sneer
i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
if she does not know how to estimate her own value i do
perhaps i am mistaken answered she
he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
my lord miss milner is taste is not a depraved one it is but too refined
burn fire burn flicker flicker flame
to night there was no need of extra heat and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones
kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night
mother carey poured coffee nancy chocolate and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake doughnuts and tarts
next came olive is turn to help in the ceremonies
ralph thurston had found a line of latin for them in his beloved horace tibi splendet focus for you the hearth fire shines
they began with the one in the family sitting room colonel wheeler ralph thurston mister and missus bill harmon with natty and rufus mister and missus popham with digby and lallie joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events
we shut our eyes the flowers bloom on we murmur but the corn ears fill we choose the shadow but the sun that casts it shines behind us still
missus harmon thought he sang too much and told her husband privately that if he was a canary bird she should want to keep a table cover over his head most of the time but he was immensely popular with the rest of his audience
the face of the mahogany shone with delight and why not when it was doing everything almost everything within the scope of a piano and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions
approaching the dining table he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth
aint they the greatest
exclaimed bill harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall
natty harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might give out at any moment
olive has another lovely gift for the yellow house said mother carey rising and to carry out the next part of the program we shall have to go in procession upstairs to my bedroom
olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas and giving it to mister popham stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it
thinks i to myself i never seen anything osh popham could not mend if he took time enough and glue enough so i carried this little feller home in a bushel basket one night last month an i have spent 11 evenin is puttin him together
at that moment the gentleman entered bearing a huge object concealed by a piece of green felt
500 men more who had been levied by the covenanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elcho who lay at perth with an army of 6000 men assembled upon the 1st news of the irish invasion
though thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
with these and some reenforcements of the atholemen and macdonalds whom he had recalled montrose fell suddenly upon argyle is country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to innerlochy and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not affrightened covenanters
by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenanters
this nobleman is character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquis of huntley and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
the king is ears were now open to montrose is counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of merchiston son of the famous inventor of the logarithms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents could rely on
historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy is horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause argyle collecting 3000 men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at innerlochy supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
the scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have 10 parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be 1st had in bringing back our king
or hath he given us any gift
they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
have mercy lord on me i pray for men would me devour
he passed through henley saint albans and came so near to london as harrow on the hill
the english it is evident had they not been previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthened a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interest to discuss
another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this psalm to be sung

if any still retained rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety
before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
the king stood up and called for that psalm which begins with these words
the parliament and the scots laid their proposals before the king
the good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for
something better something still grander must follow but what
in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
who is humpy dumpy asked the mice
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams
he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree
i am by no means old said the fir tree
i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year 0
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds
a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
this evening they all said
the ax struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
the departure was not at all agreeable
no said the tree
only that one answered the tree
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
do not you know one about bacon and tallow candles can not you tell any larder stories
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
that is the way of the world
yes in reality those were happy times
humpy dumpy fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
were i but already on the cart
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sighed so deeply
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
how kind man is after all
i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
it is a very stupid story
this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
have you not met them anywhere
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
now that too is over
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
and then what happens then
what is the meaning of this thought the tree
rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
0 that made him so angry
a story
i will not tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
and towards christmas he was one of the 1st that was cut down
squeak squeak
but i shall tell only one story
thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
it blazed up famously help help
how it will shine this evening
in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
then good bye said the rats and they went home
in the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
rejoice in thy own fresh youth
i know no such place said the tree
but it was not the fir tree that they meant
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
there is many a one considerably older than i am
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
and the gardener is boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
they were so extremely curious
there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth 100s and 100s of crowns at least the children said so
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we do not want the others
who denies that of course it does
and you belong to that small class who are happy
yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you again the course of public affairs

why should one not explore everything and study everything
thus idleness is the mother
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
the real human division is this the luminous and the shady
when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
what is slang properly speaking
the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail
this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on
she has a son theft and a daughter hunger
the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who says my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang
now when has horror ever excluded study
in this guise it becomes horrible
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
they constitute 2 different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results
to this we reply in one word only
that is why we cry education science

what is slang
to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits
in this world evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
it is unintelligible in the dark
slang makes one shudder
since when has malady banished medicine
he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it
the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang
it engenders a whole world la pegre for which read theft and a hell la pegrenne for which read hunger
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the object
why should one halt on the way
phoenician very good
to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang
one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word
people suffer in the light excess burns
it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these 2 blacknesses amalgamated compose slang
look closely at life
slang is odious
assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
each day has its own great grief or its little care
it is the language of wretchedness
there it clothes itself in word masks in metaphor rags
however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
we have never understood this sort of objections
the flame is the enemy of the wing

your letter has given me great pleasure and i should not forgive myself if i did not tell you so

a good neighbor of the brontes a clever intelligent yorkshire woman who keeps a druggist is shop in haworth and from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby is fractured leg
my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state i now live in uncertain that i ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which i shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death
i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time
tabby had lived with them for 10 or 12 years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
of this 2nd letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes
i wish it would recur again but it will take 2 or 3 interviews before the stiffness the estrangement of this long separation will wear away

keswick march 22nd 1837 dear madam
and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
i cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting southey is reply
she a tory and clergyman is daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent dissent and radicalism
after this disappointment i never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me
you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
he spoke french perfectly i have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by
though i may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your true friend robert southey
unfortunately the fracture could not be set till 60 clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
in the evenings i confess i do think but i never trouble any one else with my thoughts
she had another weight on her mind this christmas
why are we to be denied each other is society
saturday after saturday comes round and i can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that miss e is come 0 dear
still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne is delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fond anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear
come come i am getting really tired of your absence
and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which 20 years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman is daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honored
if christian perfection be necessary to salvation i shall never be saved my heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts and when i decide on an action i scarcely remember to look to my redeemer for direction
but do not suppose that i disparage the gift which you possess nor that i would discourage you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
i had not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness
tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age
stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided miss w for her fancied indifference to anne is state of health
in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event
again i thank you this incident i suppose will be renewed no more if i live to be an old woman i shall remember it 30 years hence as a bright dream
january and february of 1837 had passed away and still there was no reply from southey
i do not always succeed for sometimes when i am teaching or sewing i would rather be reading or writing but i try to deny myself and my father is approbation amply rewarded me for the privation
sir march 16th
i thought it therefore my duty when i left school to become a governess
i know the 1st letter i wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote
i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
however remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be i hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent it may be all for the best
i carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity which might lead those i live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits
the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shriveled up more or less
at tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the 3
indeed there were only one or 2 strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result
on august 27th 1837 she writes
but anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young
farewell madam
and meantime i know the greatness of jehovah i acknowledge the perfection of his word i adore the purity of the christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong
her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
this decision was communicated to the girls
why are we to be divided
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
we had meters in which there were 2 bottles of liquid
edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
the problem was solved
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in 1883
the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the 3 wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm house the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
in december 1888 mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the 6 years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1000 lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of 6 or 8 lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than 3000 lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct
why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
the arc lamp installed outside a customer is premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
the meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century
edison had installed his historic 1st great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight 2 wire system throughout of the tree kind
broad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that sweep them he is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
but the plant ran and it was the 1st 3 wire station in this country
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the 3 wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until 189917 years
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the 4th before we started up
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
you are a rare un for sitting down to your work a little while after it is time to put by
by this time the 2 gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
comb the wool for the whittaws indeed
but the windows are patched with wooden panes and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
said mister irwine with his stately cordiality
who taught you to scrub a floor i should like to know
munny i tould ike to do into de barn to tommy to see de whittawd
totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
for if he is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
no thank you i will just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
0 sir do not mention it said missus poyser
i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
0 sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you would not like it at all
i delight in your kitchen
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than 8 and 30 of fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen light footed
i never knew your equals for gallowsness
for the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the whittaw otherwise saddler who entertains them with the latest treddleston gossip
the history of the house is plain now
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came within earshot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
to all appearance molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
0 i have no doubt it is in capital order
she is going to put the ironing things away
and there is linen in the house as i could well spare you for i have got lots 0 sheeting and table clothing and toweling as is not made up
spinning indeed
i know his farm is in better order than any other within 10 miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i do not believe there is one in the kingdom to beat it
that is what you would like to be doing is it
no sir he is not he has gone to rosseter to see mister west the factor about the wool
and she was very fond of you too aunt rachel
i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
and what through the left hand window
poyser is not at home is he
by the by i have never seen your dairy i must see your dairy missus poyser
a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bare boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
that is the way with you that is the road you would all like to go headlongs to ruin
mister ottley is indeed
direction
munny my iron is twite told pease put it down to warm
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
i can no more help spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others than you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you could not rest without running to help her and comfort her
i did not preach without direction
the family likeness between her and her niece dinah morris with the contrast between her keenness and dinah is seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
several clothes horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rags
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
no no no totty ud get her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
i hanna common patience with you
i have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything i have done
we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
the fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the whittaws and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
it is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the 3 gables the windows and the door place
hetty sorrel often took the opportunity when her aunt is back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the grate which always shone like jasper
but you know more about that than i do sir
but not more than what is in the bible aunt said dinah
nay dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families
said captain donnithorne seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
when she had that bad illness and i was only 11 years old she used to say you will have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i am taken from you for she has a kind heart and i am sure i have found it so
but there is father the barn sir if he would be of any use
nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
tis late and i go myself within a short space
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission
the lad had checked him then
but take it whilst i live and wear montfichet is shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight for you will ne er disgrace our scutcheon i warrant me
robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them
rest and be still until i warn you
cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
fitzooth is hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him
never that sir he had said
truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair
most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
save me masters but you startled me rarely
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
as any in england i would say said gamewell proudly that is in his day
stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master is chamber sprang up at once in answer
his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton is ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gamewell is chamber
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton is
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs
if for a whim you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
dismiss your squire robin and bid me good e e n
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
now to bed boy
warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffrey is claims to the estate would be passed by
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
there befell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing for and against the squire is project in a breath
be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window
he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother is chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
so i did push this fellow
but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the 2nd bout
forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss but master will who peeped out 1st needed no more than one glance
george montfichet will never forget this day
he felt for and found the wizard is black cloth the squire was quite out of breath
a montfichet a montfichet gamewell to the rescue
ay and show you some pretty tricks
sister nell do you hear these marvels
give not so earnest a mind to these mummeries child
nay we refused their request most politely most noble said the little stroller
but who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve
beg me a room of the sheriff child quickly
take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you
this was so sweet a lady sir and in some manner i do think she died
he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently
surely we can submit with good grace
tis fine for you to talk old man answered the lean sullen apprentice
it is enough said george gamewell sharply and he turned upon the crowd
and henry might return to england at any moment
no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
robin fitzooth
and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us
have your will child if the boy also wills it montfichet answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
what is the tumult and rioting cried out the squire authoritatively and he blew twice on a silver whistle which hung at his belt
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout
master monceux the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting
and mine is will stuteley shall we be comrades
shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham
taking advantage of this the squire is few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robin is and the little stroller is cries fought their way to him
the wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire is cheeks
he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father
these escapades are not for old gamewell lad his day has come to twilight
now be silent on your lives he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout
pray follow us with mine and my lord sheriff is men
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriff is daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet
i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberland is sons
silence you knave cried montfichet
the strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes
will you forgive me now
before them fled the stroller and his 3 sons capless and terrified
i like you will you are the 2nd will that i have met and liked within 2 days is there a sign in that
it will be no disappointment to me
right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin
he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
spoke the squire losing all patience and it was to you that i gave another purse in consolation
it will not be safe for you to stay here now
montfichet called out for robin to give him an arm
also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid
friends said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriff is house
like as not young master though i am an old man
he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left
come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder
nottingham castle was reached and admittance was demanded
you are a worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvel
robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
a golden fortune and a happy life
the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
the head and chief of the riot the nottingham apprentice with clenched fists threatened montfichet
he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent
robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these 2 comport themselves
cries of a nottingham a nottingham
it is an antipathy an antipathy i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but do not blame me
you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
and she threw her arms round her cousin is neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
dorcas in her strange way was moved
women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
you have been so ill my poor rachel
i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
rachel is pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
chelford had a note from mister wylder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
thank you dorcas dear
yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
of mark wylder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
yes rachel i do love you
ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
and the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin is eyes
i like you still rachel i am sure i will always like you
well she was better though she had had a bad night
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
this transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
it was not very much past 11 that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redman is farm
yes said rachel
thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
at dinner lake was easy and amusing
he is not a man for country quarters
they are cousins you know we are all cousins
he had his hand upon lake is shoulder
all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
i was thinking it is very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
i am glad you like it says wylder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
but her greeting to captain lake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
and he placed it in that gentleman is fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
you know captain lake
and wylder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humor of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus dorothy only remarking
said lord chelford addressing me
i had a horrid dream about him last night that
do you know lake 0 i really can not tell but he will soon tire of country life
0 i know that is lorne brandon
their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep mouthed malignities in every new born generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and a special satanic action
i boldly lighted my cheroot
somehow i had grown nervous
miss lake declined the carriage to night
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
my bed was unexceptionably comfortable but in my then mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern
do not insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning
to my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds
bracton is a very good fellow i can assure you
and he made a little dip of his cane towards brandon hall over his shoulder
and he added something still less complimentary
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
now that is impossible radie for i really do not think i once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking
well you know radie women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i am sure from what bracton has said to me i know him intimately that dorcas likes him and i can not conceive why they are not married
the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room
i sha not trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber
if a fellow has been a little bit wild he is beelzebub at once
the somber old trees like gigantic hearse plumes black and awful
i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
mark my words you will find him too strong for you aye and too deep
i am very uneasy about it whatever it is i can not help it
by this time lord chelford and wylder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of general ship
in the meantime i had formed a new idea of her
i do not know and can not say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry
what i say is altogether on your own account
yes so they said but that would i think have been worse
all the furniture belonged to other times
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
but do not these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
for the 1st time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth i am sorry said beth
her eyes wandered to the maid is hands
the description she gave of the coming reception to the woman is political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
eliza parsons shook her head
will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally
but it can not be protested the girl
so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes is aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes
and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
one of mister hopkins is 1st tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen
her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance
eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
the democratic committee figured out a way to do this
she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap
will not you run into the house and see if martha can not spare one or 2 more maids
then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth i am elizabeth parsons
the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of 100 votes in one way or another secured from the opposition
the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fete
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
this was the 1st occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been invited guests
they they excite me in some way and i i can not bear them you must excuse me
beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the 3 cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was the mistress here and beth was her especial favorite
however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
it will not be much but i am grateful to find a friend
it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
and it ruins a man is disposition
they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer
i can not see it in that light said the old lawyer
0 say that is different observed markham altering his demeanor
as regards my robbing the company i will say that i saved them a heavy loss one day
he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily
you are foolish why should you do all this
may we see gates at once asked kenneth
they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he unlocked the door and called here is visitors tom
it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
i am running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made
then rogers would not do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
sorry we have not any reception room in the jail
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them
i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature
sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there is a bench here
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
it is a stock company and rich
he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated
a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he had been sharp
old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
i have seen lots of that kind in my day
miss de graf said kenneth noticing the boy is face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
i am not electioneering just now
fairview was 12 miles away but by 100 clock they drew up at the county jail
give me a check for a 150 and i will turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings
i will pay all the costs besides
beth uneasy at his silence nudged him
0 well sir what about him
they followed the jailer along a succession of passages
he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he did not stop to count the cost
it has cost me twice $60 in annoyance
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i did not stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i am glad i did
i am going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me
and he deserves a term in state is prison
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a $150
i have my own reasons mister marshall
some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state is prison as a consequence of his rash act
kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers is visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
sometimes i am that yearning for a smoke i am nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another
well then last here is turner is greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as 1st the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness 1st and then on the order
here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you do not know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatever perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo and the python
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire
every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these 2 etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or duerer
the crampness and the poverty are all intended
my 1st and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccio is one of his series of the life of saint george
in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
he knows them both
it is only a pencil outline by edward burne jones in illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psyche after all her troubles into heaven
but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at 1st why turner drew it at all
it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old watermill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn
that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
you will find me continually speaking of 4 men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow 2 delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
only there are 2 sorts of cloud and fire
see that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy is climbing for his entangled kite
now here is raphael exactly between the 2 trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
the colorist says 1st of all as my delicious paroquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jeweler is work rather than pictures
some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely
they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
but in this vignette copied from turner you have the 2 principles brought out perfectly
then he comes to the beak of it
in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
thus in chaucer is dream
there is one and there is another the dudley and the flint
nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolf and the gier eagle
the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
it must remember be one or the other
it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
the scene is absolutely arcadian
you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son
for god is sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be an agreeable companion not one who will disgust me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual good will the yoke imposed on us by heaven instead of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
she found the door but it was locked outside
the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretense
just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadia is whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rodolfo for the rich who are open handed always find parasites ready to encourage their bad propensities and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve it resolve on ravishing leocadia and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment
just at the moment when the tears of the pitying beholders flowed fastest and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair leocadia gave signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of all
secure as he thought in the careful administration of justice in that city and the character of its well disposed inhabitants the good hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster could befal his family
mother dear father do you hear me
choking with emotion leocadi made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them
she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hangings in the room
this person was rodolfo who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl
nor was rodolfo less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact he begged leocadia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents
on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half way towards his house and then let her go
she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman
she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed estafania
so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were induced to confess that one summer is night the same she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolfo they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolfo carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessings upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well
rodolfo and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid
time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of dona estafania who as a gentlewoman to whose sex pity is as natural as cruelty is to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover leocadia from her swoon
his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a 3rd and would have done so had he not come to himself
110 clock had struck it was a fine clear night they were the only persons on the road and they sauntered leisurely along to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the toledans in their valley or on the banks of their river
rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment and leocadia is parents reached theirs heart broken and despairing
her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked 2 maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image has been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
finally the one party went off exulting and the other was left in desolation and woe
this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required
all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
who touches me am i in bed
they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape from those audacious men
luis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
when she came to her senses and blushing to find herself in rodolfo is arms would have disengaged herself no senora he said that must not be strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul
meanwhile rodolfo had leocadia safe in his custody and in his own apartment
she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
thus did this humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe her feelings
i have great things to tell you senor said dona estafania to her husband the cream and substance of which is this the fainting girl before you is your daughter and that boy is your grandson
what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
chapter 7 on the races of man
in determining whether 2 or more allied forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties naturalists are practically guided by the following considerations namely the amount of difference between them and whether such differences relate to few or many points of structure and whether they are of physiological importance but more especially whether they are constant
the variability of multiple parts
so it is with the lower animals
effects of the increased use and disuse of parts
but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind
it is manifest that man is now subject to much variability
i stood with my back to the wall for i wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me
he acts as though he had not expected us
so we harried the coast of norway
he is but a boy the men said
their eyes danced big thorleif stood up and stretched himself
i took 5 great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him
you would not eat with us you cannot say no to half of my ale i drink this to your health
what is your country olaf have you always been a thrall the thrall is eyes flashed
come come i called when no one obeyed a fire
this is our last feast with you i said
it was so dark that i could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth
take him out thorkel and let him taste your sword
up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic
the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths
my men laughed yes a stingy host
as our boat flashed down the rollers into the water i made this song and sang it
i made her for only 20 oars because i thought few men would follow me for i was young 15 years old
by the beard of odin i cried you have taken our joke like a man
we sunk his ship and men but him we brought to you
your mother the queen was standing by
and would he not be a good gift for our baby
my dragon is belly is never full and on board went the gold
he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping
so no tales got out to the neighbors besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way
may you drink heart is ease from it for many years
the thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat
i named 9 others and said
then i drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying
and with it i leave you a name sif the friendly i shall hope to drink with you sometime in valhalla
30 men one after another raised their horns and said
here friend take it and he thrust it into the farmer is hand
here is a ring for sif the friendly and here is a bracelet a sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side
my men pounded the table with their fists
at another time harald asked
bring in the table we are hungry
so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone
so i set guards over every one in that house
but i stayed that spring and built me a boat
yes and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me the king frowned more angrily
these he gave to 3 of my brothers
at the prow i carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out
200 warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle
hakon there shall be your constant companion friend farmer
there she sat on the rollers as fair a ship as i ever saw
they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began
there stand so i said and glare and hiss at my foes
that time it pointed us into your father is ships
i am stiff with long sitting he said i itch for a fight i turned to the farmer
the rest of you off a viking he had 3 ships
then i will get me a farm and will winter in that land now who will follow me
we ate at many men is tables uninvited
what of the farm olaf not yet i answered viking is better for summer
on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together
and these shall follow your thralls in the same way
0 it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals
that is the best way to decide for the spear will always point somewhere and one thing is as good as another
so i lived and now am your tooth thrall well it is the luck of war
soft heart he said gently to her then to thorkel well let him go thorkel
your father thought a moment then looked at your mother and smiled
a robber viking said the king and scowled at me
in the stern i curved the tail up almost as high as the head
here they said is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts
a house smells of smoke a ship smells of frolic
did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on
now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said
then he turned to me again frowning
but young sharp tongue now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of
i painted the eyes red for anger
by the hammer of thor shouted grim here is no stingy coward
a little cracked that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room
the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me
i wish you good night she laid her bony hands on the back of mister meadowcroft is invalid chair cut him short in his farewell salutation to me and wheeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave
he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene
our 1st impressions of people are in 9 cases out of 10 the right impressions
in 5 minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company
she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father
envy hatred malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by a sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in naomi and my other interest in the little love looks which i now and then surprised passing between her and ambrose i should never have sat through that supper
a more dreary and more disunited family party i never sat at the table with
a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figure too slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears
they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table
mister jago is an american philip
the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality
you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with john jago his cigars will poison you
mister meadowcroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the newcomer to me with a side glance at his sons which had something like defiance in it a glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with the defiance on their side by the 2 young men
philip lefrank this is my overlooker mister jago said the old man formally presenting us
make acquaintance with mister jago sit together
ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room
when i addressed him he answered constrainedly
it was one of the masterly and charming stories of dumas the elder
silas slunk away without a word of protest ambrose stood his ground evidently bent on making his peace with naomi before he left her seeing that i was in the way i walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room
naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them as if the 2 sturdy young farmers had been 2 children
he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown
a new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room
for once in a way i proved a true prophet
the door opened again while i was still studying the 2 brothers without i honestly confess being very favorably impressed by either of them
all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broad splashes
in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
but such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey
almost instantly he was forced to the top
it might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
the hawk embittered by the loss of his 1st quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws
the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawk is angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
in fact he had just finished it the last of the trout is tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped
where the waves for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch
the great hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground
but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
as he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive is head
the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
then the leader parted from the line
his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the 1st time the fisherman standing on the bank
but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding
the merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
lend me your ear for 10 minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is
a stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors even when called charles hawtrey or owen nares are real people just like you and me
in novels the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted but no stage hero would do anything so unnatural as this
and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
i say i have been wondering about this business
lady larkspur starts suddenly and turns towards him
then lord tuppeny well what about auction
it is to let hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know
but it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection
hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment then hands him a cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle
but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows what no hamlet speaking
larkspur bit me again this morning for the 3rd time
and there you are you will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the maneuvering very much more natural
i have got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps i would better keep the plot a secret for the moment
tea please matthews butler impassively
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler
indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlet is soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole 30 lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist is meaning
enter hamlet with his favorite boar hound
in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural
in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
but suppose you said i am fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch
the crowd drifts off leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage and then you can begin
if it be granted 1st that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play
enter lord arthur fluffinose
your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one

then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage
this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself
relapses into silence for the rest of the evening
in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
you gave me 55 i want 99 hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking
we moderns however see the absurdity of it
re enter butler and 3 footmen who remove the tea things hostess to guest
now the object of this soliloquy is plain
ham to be or not to be
i want to get away from it all swoons
how you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece
he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls
2 bites are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the footman and say half a mo old chap i have not nearly finished but the actor is better schooled than this
anyhow it is jolly exciting and i can do the dialog all right
frankly i cannot always say
9923 elsinore 99 yes hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking
and i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy
the duchess of southbridge to lord reggie 0 reggie what did you say
hello stephanos here comes the dedalus
he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
stephanos dedalos
he could wait no longer
the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father is shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
a voice from beyond the world was calling
whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar is weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of nomads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet luster
again again
the uncouth faces passed him 2 by 2 stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
words was it their colors
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in a chord
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
brother mac ardle brother keogh
the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshaled races

angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hickey
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love

the chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
he clasped his hands on the desk and said
he tried to think how it could be
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the 2 species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow
if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune

stephen is heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him 1st a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state

the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying
the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelley is fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts the bell rang
then you can ask him questions on the catechism dedalus
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
a great saint saint francis xavier
he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
the rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on
if a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized
he had the faith in him that moves mountains
