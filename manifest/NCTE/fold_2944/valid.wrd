alright 23230 is great okay boys and girls today we are going to talk about fractions and before we talk about anything i want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions okay let us see what we know about fractions what do you know about fractions it is when like a square or when it is divided up into 4
that would probably be a fraction okay when a square is broken up into 4 and a few are shaded in that is a fraction okay what else do we know about fractions let us see what else do we know about fractions the top number is the denominator and bottom is the numerator okay let us think about that for a minute what do you know about fractions
the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the the denominator okay what else do we know about fractions does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole hold on one sec there is fraction that you can do with a half or a whole no i said that fractions have to do with . 0 they have to do with a half or whole okay what else do we think we know about fractions
okay we are going to talk about what the top number is called and what the bottom number is called go ahead isaac what do you know about fractions the .
if there is a shape you can split them in half who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape caleb
if it is a circle it is one whole okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute let us see if what we are saying is valid or what what we are saying is true any other thoughts about fractions last thoguht diana what do you have there is a certain way to write the to write it down there is a certain way to write it down okay alright lots of information
lots of good thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction is a fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay we could call the whole we could call it a whole
we could call it a region what else could we call it
that it that is all you got okay it is part of that whole or region a fraction is also a part of a group of things or we could call it a set of things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group i want a part of that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it
okay because that is very important when you are talking about fractions you are going to take an equal part of a whole re or region or an equal part of a set okay so i want equal parts here my whole how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions
you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want i want to cut something in half one line in the middle right in the middle okay i want an equal amount on one side and an equal amount on the other side so i just did what to that hole i cut it in half half so i am going to label that half a half okay
and how i label it is i take the number of pieces i cut this into how many pieces 222 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the denominator denominator
okay or the bottom number some of you told me right that is the denominator the number of pieces i shaded in is called the .
numeral nu mer a tor everybody say it
numerator numerator okay so that whole i cut into 2 equal pieces the number of pieces i cut it into was the denominator ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see is the numerator okay so if this is one half one half and one half right
one half here one half here how many halves make a whole 22 okay this is my group this is my set how many are there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 66 and i say these are jellybeans and i am hungry this afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans
kay that is my fraction what is the numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry alright so my nu or my fraction is 3 out of 6 i colored in 3 out of 6 i am going to eat 3 out of 6 i am going to get fat okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in
okay and the bottom number is the one that you shaded in is the number of pieces or the number in the set or the group okay you guys think you understand that
yes are you good okay so now we know numerator is the top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about and the denominator is the .
 bottom number the number of pieces in your whole or the number out of the whole set out of the group okay so here we have how many out of how many
66 alright so that is just some of your vocabulary numerator and denominator if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards if you are going to match your vocabulary word with what it means with its meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish it is kind of like go fish
i would like you to play concentration with them 1st that means all of them go upside down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match
0 okay alright so that is your 1st centers right here your vocabulary words are are you listening yep numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think listen to the word equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin
equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction just like this set right here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
3 that is half half of those circles yes yes okay here is one half the circle and here is the other half this is shaded in this is not so 3 sixths is the same as one half one half they are the same thing okay they are equivalent fractions i could do this with my region okay
here is my whole region whoops sorry here it is okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i
okay so i am going to get it into 6 pieces and i am going to do the same thing i am going to color in half so now it is not halves i am talking about it is what sixths and how many did i color in
3 okay so one half is the same as .
3 sixths okay those are equivalent fractions caitlin or it could be like 48s 48s is an equivalent faction it is half of the set 4 is half of 83 is half of 61 is half of 2 wait it is ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then we have got one half 3 sixths
somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is half of 10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another 11020s 10 twentieths yes absolutely great job isaac can i use the bathroom quickly
that is okay go ahead go ahead 9 eighteenths 9 eighteenths thank you isaac dante 51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job okay you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions that is the question i was going to ask what that if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent .
w no it is an equivalent fraction to one half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are yes okay they they they cover the same area or they name the same part of a set
okay equivalent fractions the next word is fraction what is a fraction what is it a a region or a whole that is not a fraction this is not a fraction this is that region of that whole piece that is not a fraction is it no it is a equal lateral
whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of a whole okay half and half quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter how many quarters is that 444
a quarter or a 4th a 4th a 4th and a 4th what if it equals a whole equals a whole it is a whole right okay so it is a part of a whole or a part of a set but it has to be equal part you have to remember that okay equal part a mixed number is .
a fract a whole number and a fraction okay a whole number and fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number and a fraction that is called a mixed number who can give me another mixed number a whole number and a fraction
give me a whole number and a fraction
4 fourths 4 and i need a fraction now take one from the board and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number it is a whole number plus a fraction give me a mixed number 5 and one half good 5 and one half
it is a whole number and a fraction dante 5 and 6 6 thirds i mean 3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good giving me a mixed number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good caitlin
8 and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
what is a mixed number
a whole number and a fraction okay got it okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way to say a mixed number okay an improper fractions has a larger numerator .
over a smaller denominator 0
if you look this is 2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what what how many halves is it 2 and how many halves is it let us count them 2
let us count them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah yes so this is the mixed number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half 0
and there are 12345 halves these are the same 2.5 and 5 halves got it huh sure yes a little bit yes okay i think the only other vocabulary words you need to know benchmark fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the definition okay
because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year and then the last vocabulary word is .
 is called simplest form simiplest form that is another one i am going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions is there a problem right here okay
i did not write on my hand
thank you alright vocabulary cards look vocabulary cards okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice addition and subtraction
there is extra paper right in the back okay this center right here can i just borrow that just the top part honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st i have gone over this already turn the question around into your answers okay
so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer okay jaylon you hold this one it goes right here right here yep pass out paper to these 6 people right here in this center
do not forget to ttqa alright okay and my group right here you are coming back with me 1st okay so carefully to the back table with a pencil yes makenzie you may use the bathroom now honey carefully to the back table with a pencil what can i go to the bathroom yep go quick
and come back quick what is it ashley never mind you all set okay alright do not forget you are working shh in centers
so you should be whispering dylan can you put that back on the sill for me honey let us take one of these chairs out so you are not squished
alright yes please use your problem solving skills
yes dear i hit my arm now it is feeling like now it feels like it went to sleep 0 it is just tingles you hit your funny bone it feels weird can you put your name please who are we missing right yeah she is at the bathroom and ayana who .
ayana christian
so put your name and date and i will be right with you okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other
quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper okay somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that what is a fraction
what is a fraction it is a equal .
 parts parts equal part of a whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay so if i had a candy bar if i did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart okay
let us say that our hershey is bar had 6 sections in it okay can you imagine that in your head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here close your eyes and think about it can you see that chocolate bar yes i can see it clearly
no honey you got to listen so now we have 6 pieces in our chocolate bar right and if this chocolate bar had to be shared equally .
how many pieces would each of them get 3 and how do you know that cause this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but okay
i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar 66 so the whole candy bar has how many pieces 6 so what do we call that number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in 6 now .
if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces 33 so what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3
yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word numerator say it numerator one more time numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the we just said it numerator out of
6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
denominator you guys are getting these words really mixed up listen numerator and denominator listen the 3 is the numerator can you say it please
christian you say it please 3 is the numerator yep do not star say it again the numerator michael you say it 6 is the denominator good 3 is the numerator
numerator cause if you get them mixed up here and you and read a paper that says what number is the numerator you really need to know which one is which okay so the 3 is the numerator
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it 6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you denominator good denominator denominator perfect so how many pieces are there in the candy bar
3 how many is cheyenne going to eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another 3 sixths equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar excellent what is it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes alright
so we have rectangular paper right this is going to be our region or our whole okay
yes you should okay we are going to take our 1st rectangle what what are the dimensions of a rectangle what does it tell us the dimensions of a rectangle are what are the dimensions of your rectangle makenzie what are the dimensions of the rectangle
look at your paper well 4 times 4 times 6 for by 6 okay 4 times 6 or 4 by 6 isaac have a seat
so i am going to pretend this is my new candy bar there is not 6 pieces anymore are there no no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy are in this candy bar 644 by 64 times 6
michael honorable come on thank you michael thanks okay see when you are paying attention you are right on sit up straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6 right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie and only makenzie okay
alright if i were to find .
i want to separate this 4 by 6 rectangle into 2 equal pieces so makenzie and i have the same amount well let us see let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half
okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here and half over here okay so i have got one half here and one half here
alright so we have got this huge candy bar we just cut it in half right how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half prove it to me prove that we just cut this huge .
prove it i do not know if that is the right line i do not if i i cut it exactly i do not know if i cut it exactly in half
beautiful job excellent explanation absolutely right so let us count and make sure each side has 12 why is your hand raised honey i do not know i do not either let us let us count each half and make sure there is 12 in each half 12 count yours 456789101112 on one side and i know if there is 12 on one side . there has to be 12 on the other side because 12 +12 equals 24
24 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in listen to the conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil
take a pencil line right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares no we did not okay i am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount
we are each going to get 12 small pieces okay this is what i am going to do next so we all are we all on the same page now are we all on the same page now okay almost alright now i cut my candy bar in half and i gave half to makenzie so we are both going to get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay
now this is what i want you to do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units 24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way to give me 2 equal pieces i want .
i want a half look at your look at your paper i want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half so that both christian no christian does not like chocolate both michael and ayana get equal number of pieces go ahead go to your next rectangle go to your next rectangle
nope i want halves i want to see halves go to your next rectangle okay waiting for you find a new way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar okay well you know what
i am going to get a different example not chocolate bar for you okay christian maybe it maybe it will be pizza okay let us see i want to see another way to make one half on your paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one i label this half and this half
and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar okay did you find a new way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing
because if they are not something needs to be done about it isaac what is wrong nothing okay okay let us see if we found a different way
vertically up and down in half he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half
he cut it in half i know there is 1224681012 here so there must be 24681012 here what is wrong 0 the there you need to write the the how many squares are in that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in who knows what is wrong
what is wrong makenzie
0 what is wrong one halfs are in the wrong position
on the top and on the bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did good job you just labeled it wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
nice job makenzie let us see yours same way yeah i did mine diagonally did you label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job 0 d let us think about that would diagonal count let us let us think about it that is a good question
who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half what do you think do you have the same number on top and on bottom no yes absolutely good look at me nice job nice job
if you are cutting something in half if you take it diagonally and they are the same number on one side as there re on the other side it is definitely halves
i split one whole okay so on top you would right one half and on the bottom you would write one half 0 i did that i did that
does anybody have a different way i did diagonal no other ways to make half and half let me ask you a question 0 sit down please ayana it is not a talent show it is not a fashion show have a seat alright yes christian said well what about diagonally the other way would that work yeah
absolutely okay would it be like possible to like make a circle and then hm probably not a circle probably not a circle now let me ask you a question can we put the plus sign how many small squares in each half you guys should know that right now how many small squares how many square units are in each half 12 thank you michael 12 here and 12 here why
because 12 +12 equals 24 alright so if you have 24 small squares in one side in one half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half do you still have halves know i mean yes yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2
and there is 8 and there is and there is watch 2 how much do we have to split it in can you just hold on a 2nd hold on a sec ayana hold on a sec means stop okay okay
take a look at what i did cheyenne
let us look let us count you ready
123456789101112123456789101112 so is that half yes absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles so what do you think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge i challenge you to make one more different way one more different half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other i challenge you
did you make sure that you counted and there are 12 in each side or each piece has 12
can we shade it in i know one where is wait where is you one half i do not see that you separated this rectangle anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
if you find another way i want you to try one more way okay be right back how we doing girls good how is this group doing good you doing okay huh where is is savannah your group yeah nice job did you guys go through the cards once yeah did you win no no did savannah win
yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time yeah who won 0 congratulations yeah i got like 4 okay i kept on guessing but i got it this group all set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed
it said something it said something that is on the top i do not think it said that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator what is a benchmark well where are your what are your matches show me your matches we just put them down 0 you just put them down did everybody check each other is work yes okay
you show me you can put them all flip them all over right now and just match them for me so i can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are okay flip em all over good put them in matches you too do the same thing flip them all over and put them in matches yeah can i get a band aid a band aid what happened honey
wash your hands with soap and water i will be right over
yep that is what it says awesome centers are almost over 5 minutes what honey there are 4 centers i did not say you were going to do them all today 0 miss richards i found 2 ways ooh show me i did this yay i did this
show me 0 that is awesome yes alright let us see christian show us yours okay so 1st you know what i am just going to go over it with green so we can see it okay kay did you check to make sure there is 12 in each yeah
awesome and which which other ones 123456789101112 nice job christian woah did you say you did 2 more 0 well hold on to that one everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana
so right here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper you have made a half christian 2 halves make a whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals 11 whole you made another one let us see
123456789101112 nice job ayana show everybody guys take a look at ayana is 12 good work did you do another one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you any more
and there is even 12 in this in this box i did this what
yep okay and the other halves did you make another one i want to make another one i want to see one more from you makenzie i am not sure what you are doing over there but you are you are i made 2 writing numbers like crazy show me what you are doing
what is this one
it is kind of like similar kind of like similar i hope you are making halves and not fourths or 20 fourths like this you have got you have made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay
as many pieces as you cut your whole into christian no it is not because you have made look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece 0 get it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
you definitely have to get rid of the lines i would just get rid of the let me see which 11234567891011 twelfths nice job 12s what did i say 12 square units one half you have made half this is way easy i am so glad that it is way easy this it is easier than way easy this is not half sweetheart halves are 2 pieces to make one whole
you have got more than 2 pieces here right yeah .
you have got to take everything out except for the one line that you are using to cut your 4 by 6 rectangle in half okay where do we go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit come over here okay i did one hold on where show me
i just made another one i do not under i do not see the halves did you do this boom boom boom boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope
you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see
123456789101112
alright you guys listen how many people i need you to sit down ayana but you know what cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table have a seat have a seat that is okay that is alright it is okay we are learning and sharing okay what do we do
no but sweetheart once you stop right here and here that is your piece you can use halves but it has to equal 12 square units so this only equals 12345 wholes and a half is 6 that is only 6 square units not 12 this
you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next nicholas are you all set all set okay listen up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now
i am going to challenge you and i am going to walk away your challenge put your hand down to fill the rest of these nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay listen listen listen 1st i will come over and look at yours in a sec but do not we need different numbers listen
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2 cause the denominator is going to be 4
you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch watch you made halves like this right yes i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths
and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them 4 no i mean 66 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into 4s fourths but the same is 6 and the number of square units is 6 that is right do we have a number yep we do
alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me that is hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them okay if you need more paper it is here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
let me see that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i i just made a new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 123456789101112
0 right here okay i see that now good job makenzie excellent excellent you got halves and you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here fourths makenzie here you go honey i do not know what is going on here but i am i am hoping it has to do with your center lovely kay guys i did it are you finished with your centers
yes lovely i did it but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction adam are you all set yes yes what happened 0 i i put my chair back and it hit the desk did he injure you in any way no thank goodness scoot in excuse me miss richards
because it says to no i gave you this paper in case you needed scrap okay this is the paper if you needed scrap paper okay that is fine that is fine
i know go sit down i know i know what isaac is doing
now you have fourths this is going straight down okay that is fourths my guy that is fourths good job yep okay i told this group to bring do you have all your matches together and you have all your matches together let us see if they isaac go have a seat
finish your center you have got 3 minutes
let us read i do have my glasses did you help i hope you helped over here okay a number that has a whole number and a fraction a whole number and a fraction is that called a look at me is that called simplest form what is that called mixed number oops let us fix that one okay
you have a sheet please
