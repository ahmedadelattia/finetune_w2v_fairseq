okay camera is now on it is 11 30 december 13 this is math class so recording is in progress okay let me have your attention please boys and girls
put the books away and get your folder ready and your notebook as well as your box so last week we have been exploring volume right and volume of a rectangular prism so can someone just tell us and or remind us how you have how we found the volume okay of this box or this rectangular prism
we multiply the length by width by the height okay so we figured out one way to do this it was to multiply the length the length the width the width and then the height okay so that was one way to find right and we all tried that okay what is another is there another way to find this dylan the bottom of the surface times the height can you speak up please the bottom of the surface times the height the bottom of i think the bottom of the surface
the surface here you said yeah okay so surface for example this one has 5 across and 4 this way so what does that mean the surface has 4120 squares and if you were to put cubes you can put 20 cubes right the bottom layer huh and why do you multiply by 3 dylan because that is the height
because that is the height that is the 3 layers right so if you were to take apart the 3 layers then you have 3 layers of cube any other ways that we tried or you tried no
okay so last time you made this box and this is box one and we did volume and i think everyone i would say everyone did very well on the test on friday in terms of finding volume
okay so i do not think anyone had a problem finding volume and maybe there is a couple of problems with other things being careless you know for example the pattern that you miscount or miscalculated and then you something else just being careless but in terms of volume and i think you had no problem doing that
so today we are going to shift into something not volume but similar well i should not say similar to volume but something that we can use this box to find to help us to start okay and that is called a surface area
okay so today we are going to explore finding the surface area of an object of a rectangular prism
okay so just write down surface area and what does that look like to you the word surface area what does that sound like what do you think it means alphonsus okay so the surface like you know this board has a surface right the floor has a surface but what about area what about what is area
selina so area is the number of
okay you remember this right okay so area that is the number of square units right of an area for example this floor you can count the number of squares the number of tiles
this board if we put a grid here then you can also count the number of squares okay so does that have to do with the inside does that have to do with cubes if we are just looking at the surface no think about it okay we are thinking of we are looking at surface so if we all right why did you say no louis
maybe because it is not finding the whole prism okay it is not the whole prism but it is just the surface so for example if you just look at the surface of this how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box 4 maybe 24 there are 24 squares right because it is 6 by 4 yeah
and what about the surface of this the bottom of this box how many squares do you see 4 are not they the same yeah yes these are the same so can i say that they have the same surface or the area 0 yes okay are the same now but if you look at the 2 boxes do they hold the same number of cubes
no no so can i say that the volume is different okay yeah this one versus this one but what about the surface just the bottom we are just looking at the bottom yeah same right so area is the same but volume is different so if we look at the surface are we looking at the inside you know how many cubes it can fit
no it can fit in here no okay we are just looking at the surface okay so for example this paper has a surface and you can see the number of squares here right okay but if i turn it this way suppose you can look at the paper that is flat from this angle do you see any are you supposed to you know if this is 2 dimensional
you are not supposed to see any height right okay but it has a surface but there is no volume and last week i think we said that volume has to do with what kind of objects the shape the 3 dimensional 3 dimensional solids 3 dimensional solids right dylan
so i want you to remember this boys and girls and as we find the area or the surface we are not going to think about the volume okay so
0 just momentarily no problem so what was i saying the volume okay when we look at the surface area we are not going to think about volume okay so what you are going to do is to create a box that looks like this but this time i am going to give you a grid that looks like this instead of the pattern
you will have to figure out the pattern okay for making this and you just draw it and cut it out and make a box okay the size of this all right and this is the same as the 1st one that you made last week before you added okay now after that okay pay attention please
okay after that you are actually going to use this as a cover and this is a box so you cover this box and now it is a rectangular prism right okay so again we are not looking at volume so not the inside but only on the outside the surface okay so let me just .
let me just help you start by looking at one of the surface one of the sides so let us say the box you know it is like this simon okay now let us say this is the top okay i just call it the top and that is the bottom right sides front back okay
so okay how can we find the surface or the area of this front this top side jackie measure length from width length
okay that is 6 centimeters 6 units and then 4 units this way so how many 33 units there are 24 not just units but square units okay
so 6 times 4 ah square units okay does that make sense so now we took care of the top okay and then what other sides
how many sides are there in a rectangular prism how many different sides 3666 right 66 top bottom 12 front back 34 side side 56 okay
so what you are going to do is you will make this box 1st and then i want you to write okay the top area figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom the area of the front side area of the back side the side one of the sides and then the other side okay so once we have all 6 of those what does that mean
we have found all the surfaces right all the sides and then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism we add em up we add all the edges up you just add everything up and then you have the total surface area okay of this okay so why do not i have you start by making the top
so this is for pattern pattern for box one ..
okay yeah people will hook them we have like 15 and then can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way thank you okay does everyone have one you need one more yes
so use a pencil to to make the pattern
okay so make sure you count carefully ..
okay can you stop for a minute jackie okay so how many squares across how many units if you count from here how many 4 square units how many 4 right square units how about this way from here to here
is it also 4 square units yes so is this going to match huh you make okay you need to make a pattern that is this size right okay and only one layer one unit high okay all right very good
very good very good no that is 25s
you all set judy
not yet . why are you making another one louis
because i messed it up 0 so here you just cut the corner is that right yeah okay that is fine you can do another one what are you looking for tape tape
just tape the top and you do not have to tape the lid you know the cover okay yeah just tape the side so you can cover this
okay now that is the same as this okay who is using duct tape so how boys how do you think we can find the area
okay do you remember we talked about this or the surface area of this whole rectangular prism just find out the area that had this part or this part right
okay do you agree with that wait simon the area we are looking at
no you add this 20 +24 +18 okay simon can you say that again what do you mean they share because like right here if you put the cube in right
this square and this square are the same square so they are part of the same cube yes so we can not count them twice but remember what we said are we working with cubes okay we are not doing cubes anymore and this time simon it is just the surface just the surface okay just the surface so this has nothing to do with that because we are not doing cubes okay it is just a square 0 in other words how many squares are there all around this
okay okay okay so remember surface area area is just the surface not the inside okay that is a good point do you understand yeah okay so can you start counting not counting calculating
okay write in your notebook just like the way i wrote on the board so once you have your box boys and girls you can start figuring out the surface area of this box the entire box
it is just like counting all the squares around this box okay so that is the number of squares area
so what do you mean what do you actually mean here gordan tell me about this how did you figure these out
huh so the top area i can know by the bottom because it is the same area okay so you are saying the top area is the same as the bottom area okay
huh okay where is the front so 3 units by 4 units show me huh go ahead so there are 12 square units right
and then the front and the back are the same okay then what about the last 2 right okay so that is why you did it twice okay and how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangle
and then you have the surface surface area okay very good okay are you what are you working on
0
okay so just quickly fix it and then you can start looking for the area that is good okay so ming what is the strategy for finding the surface area
okay just a minute okay why do not you look at this for now all right so tell me how you can find the surface area or what is the surface area the top the area of the top
you find it by multiplying the length by the width okay and why did you why do you have to multiply the length by the width to figure out the area where is the area the units okay the number what are these square units good so once you have this then what do you do
remember we have to look for the surface area that means they are all these sides all together all right yes sir so what do you have to do well can you figure out this area of this side how about the area of this
and so what does that mean
right so once the area around the box yes so how do you find the total surface area well you can do this right you can do this so once you have all 6 then then what do you do i do not know okay so let us see that in your notebook all right
so let us put this aside and why do not you start writing hey boys and girls i need to see that in your notebook okay so you need to write down surface area okay lawrence where is it put this book away where is the surface area
i do not know and you need to show me how you found 108 108 what units surface area is that a unit so you need to show how you found each one okay
all right are you all set okay so you got the 1st step if you have tape yes you can just take this corner all right okay samantha you know what is happening
what are you what are what are you looking for now
all round this box right okay . okay so how do you think you can find the area to the bottom so let us say that is the top this is the bottom
go ahead so can you write that down all right alphonsus i need to see your work wait are you sure after we add to all these we add all the colors why are we doing this why are you adding
why do you need to add those numbers and what is surface area the area of the 3 dimensional shape okay kevin if you were to explain to someone what surface area is let us say you have this prism okay then what do you do how do you explain it
surface area is the area on what surface it is just one surface all the sides and surface okay so how do you think you earlier you asked me whether you have to add the numbers right so do you have to add those and why
right okay so once you have found 6 surfaces and then you just add them right and that is exactly what marlene just said is that right very good excuse me okay now if you were looking at this box like this right
so where is the top this is the top bottom front back right side and side can you see there are 6 sides and you can also look at it from this angle so can this be the front and then what would the back be right side and side right
so depending on how you look at the box if you put it up this way then this would be the top okay so you have to decide how you want to look at this box and then figure out okay the front side back top bottom
okay esther let me see your let us see so what do you have to do next we count the bottom area
okay and what do you notice about the top and the bottom they are the same okay and can you see that they are actually the same yeah all right now you have top and bottom excuse me okay michael i want you to start figuring out the the answer and how did you get this number
well at 1st i was looking at this then i do not think we can count it did you count all the squares no kevin did you write down the surface area and you showed how you found it okay can you check with each other and make sure you agree
yes michael 0 i counted all the squares yeah okay you counted each one of these okay well that works because you are looking for the surface of this whole thing right but what i would like you to do is to take this box like one side at a time so you calculate the area of this side this side this side this side this side and then what do you do at the end
huh
and then you have the total surface area okay just like the way i wrote on the board is it a red yes sir right there okay let us see okay very good all right okay maybe another minute boys and girls take another minute to finish
and then if you are done i would like you to write down okay listen in please to write down how you can calculate or find a surface area of a rectangular prism okay so if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find a surface area and what would you say
okay just write it down okay
okay let me have you stop for a minute boys and girls so i think most of you have found that the area of all the sides okay so how can we find the area the surface area or the area to all of these sides around this rectangular prism what is this you have to combine all the areas okay do you agree with that
you have to combine all the areas okay of the area of the sides
okay so we need to find the area how many squares on each surface right
okay so can you help finish this the rest of this and what about the bottom area okay james
i am sorry okay so let us say we are looking at this box from this angle let us say this is 6 and 4 and 3 okay so the bottom .
okay bottom is this area here right okay so how do we find the bottom area james we multiply okay multiply
did i hear 24 units yes okay why is it important to say square units instead of units are they the same no because a square unit would be 3 dimensional 2
okay square units mean okay are these squares yeah so are these square units yes so it is important because they can be any type of unit so it is important because people might get confused like what kind of unit square angle
right if you just say units then it could be an inch a centimeter okay a foot et cetera right but when you say square units what does that mean you actually count squares number of squares
so when we say cubic just like last week we count the number of cubes or boxes right cubes okay so it is very important that you use the right unit okay now let us move on to the next one so cole what would the next one be let us say this is the front the front area would be listen in please
okay ..
well okay how come some people disagree okay let us hear it marlene did you disagree no so is it wrong that it is 3 by 66 by 306 by 3 does it matter it is the same okay now group one all right okay hold it hold it
how many people actually have 3 units by 6 units okay how many have 6 units by 3 units okay and do you get the same answer the same number of squares how many have something different for the front side joshua what do you have i have 3 times 43 times 4 how did he get 3 times 4
he went the other way 0 so this is your front side is that right joshua okay okay so simon simon which is front is this front side or is this front side this is probably both what do you mean both explain to us please like it depends on the okay one at a time it depends on the way you look at it
you could you could say you could like say this is the front as well you could like say this is the front this is the front okay and do you agree with him depending on how you look at this right and i drew this up here i say we are going to look at this box from this angle so we say this is the front side but if you look at it from this way that is your front the front side right can the top be the front also yeah okay all right
so let us just keep this as the front side and what about the the cole so what is that
okay all right someone else the back side kevin it is the same is that right yeah okay very good and then the side so this side and that side okay dylan what is the side or left side this side
i am sorry can you see this
so what is that side or this side oops this side 03 by 4 okay
so 3 units by 4 units and that is 12 okay and then the last one okay selina
okay and that is 12 right okay and i asked you to write down how you find the total surface area so what would you say lily coyne how can you find the total surface area all of these
okay so now the surface area of this rectangular prism is
okay remember square units all right are you all set yeah okay so let me give you another one to practice and you can use this box or you can draw a box but this is it has different dimensions okay so for this 11st of all i am going to have you find the volume
and then you will find the surface area okay so this is the rectangular prism okay wait a minute simon let us leave that up okay because i want people to be able to see that ..
okay so draw in your notebook i have to draw what i want you to draw the prism and then i want you to find the volume okay we have been practicing finding volumes right and then the surface area
what are the dimensions of this box michael do you see the numbers
okay william what is this 1224 i counted the number of cubes did you count the number of cubes yeah
so earlier we said that we can find one layer and then multiply it by the number of layers right so what is that bottom layer how many cubes can that hold 44 okay now remember we are going back to volume so the number of cubes you can put inside 0 without this 12
so now there are 2 layers so 24 right so volume is 24 cubic inches that is good and now you are going to think about the surface area okay excuse me
so volume how did you find the volume what is that okay write it next to it please
okay so you have the box and now look for the volume and then look for the surface area so remember to label the numbers rachel labeling 0 you labeled with number but what about the units
huh i am sorry volume squared okay now remember volume going back to last week what does volume mean the number of cubes we can put inside right
so what units do we call those what is that top
did you finish lawrence male yes now what are you supposed to do to these numbers are we supposed to just leave the numbers without labels and then what i would like you to do is to find see if you can find an easier way to find the surface area instead of finding the top and then the bottom and the front and the back is there an easier way
i think there is really yes i think so 2 times okay if you want to look at this 2 times 4 is 2 times 2 times that and then times 28
no no no 2 times one and then like easy like these 2 numbers you times them so which is 8 and you do 8 for the next one as well okay you do times 2 times 3 which is 64 times 3 12 times 12 okay why did you do those twice each one twice because like for each side like right here i am going to try no no that is not that is not right you still find the same answer because each side is the same
okay like on the other side huh this side and the back side it says right the top and the bottom okay very good so you notice the front and the back and the top and the bottom those are the same and instead of finding it 2 times you know you just find once and then multiply by 2 very good so maybe you can try to write a formula
okay those people who finished see if you can write a formula for finding a surface area see if there is an easier way to do that instead of doing 6 steps and then add is there an easier way
do you see a pattern any patterns i can make it into 3 steps okay and how is that how does that work because this is the same on the other side so you can do 4 times 2 times 2 so but that is only 3 steps okay i have got the answer good so so you do not have to repeat that right because it okay
very good can you write a formula just write it down 00 so the formula is i would be just adding just multiplying it out
okay what do you notice about these numbers they are the same right yeah and so are these you see so how can you write a formula i can not yet write a formula if you can write a formula to find surface area something that is easier you know than doing one side at a time
think about it later okay not now
yes you could do top times top plus front plus right times 2 i did it so top area plus front area plus right area times 2 why times 2
0 very good can you write it just write the whole formula surface area equals i got one step we do length times height times width
remember what that we did that last week right so what is that 0 i know how what would that be if you multiply it
right that would be the volume but we are not looking for volume right i mean you found the volume now we are looking for surface area i figured out an easier way okay because if you know the top area is 6 times 4 you do not have to do the bottom because it is going to be the same so you go the sides and both sides and front and back and then left and right
okay so if you only find one of them and then double multiply by 2 then you find okay very good it has got to be the same yes it is like one is over here and then the other side right very good very good boys and girls it is almost time for us to go so but we will come back after gym i am sorry
okay so when we come back excuse me listen okay so i would like you to think about a way or a formula or a shorter way an easier way to find surface area okay and then when we come back we will have a few more minutes before lunch and then we can talk about that okay
so and for homework okay i do have more of these rectangular prisms simon for you to go home and find and practice finding surface area okay so why do not you just leave everything here and then line up quietly
i am going to turn off the camera
