so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0 so i think anthony you were the one that said that right so anthony is right negative numbers have value that is less than 0
does anyone know what do we call numbers like 1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 so 0 is kind of in between right it is neither positive nor negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20 right
so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say oh my account is negative so that means that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30
now you are negative $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game so some of you mentioned golf but also like video games sometimes right i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative
it will say minus the point or minus however many points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah there are negative numbers on a thermometer we talked yesterday about the thermometer right so we looked at it 2 different ways right
this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right this side has fahrenheit and celsius and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right what were some of the landmark numbers we talked about do you remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what do you remember what the celsius is when it is 32 degrees fahrenheit it is what temperature in the celsius 00
and what is that temperature freezing temperature of water that is right 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and we talked about what was that average human body temperature 212 i think it was but you are right what was 212 boiling water boiling of water right and then we talked about bath water is about 110
okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home do any of you notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right but some people still have these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water
all right in the thermostat that is what we call it it shows the temperature there right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right
and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer during what season winter right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers so going back to the chart it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer we just talked about that in golf there are scores with negative numbers
so how many of you watch golf do any of you or play golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3 or 4 let us do 4 that is easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole
what is your score what did you say -one because there it was expected you would need 4 strokes hitting the ball 4 times to get the ball in the hole you only took 3 so it is -one and the more the higher your negative number the better you are doing because that is how many strokes under par so if you did exactly 4 strokes if it took you 4 times hitting the ball to get it into the hole you would be on par which means your score would be 0
if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay
negative temperatures are cold temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right where do we expect warmer temperatures all year long all year long we talked about location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long arizona because it is closer yep
california and miami we noticed they had warmer temperatures where did we notice the coldest temperatures no matter and the poles right the north pole and the south pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time that is why your desk needs to be cleared off
so i am going to start out by showing you the game board so this game is called number line tug of war so
all right i want you to look at this think about what you think the object of the game might be not yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game look at the spinner at your table talk to a partner tell me what you think about this game what do you think but how how are you going to win look at what you have you have a spinner you have these spaces here
you have a star over here and a star over here so talk to your partner
orion why do not you go to table 3 and table 4 go to table 4 isaiah come over here segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
michael can you go see if they are at the end of the hallway because i accidentally just pressed something and i do not know if i turned it off yes oh let us wait 12nd so i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again is that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something
so i just want to make sure it is still working so well i do not want to press it again in case it is nothing uhh so look at the game board again i am going to remind you what you are thinking about think about what do you see on the spinner why do you think the spinner is designed the way that it is think about this says team one this says team 2 you see stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
the other side one is on the left side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no you do
where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working let us just keep going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner does everyone see that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what
less than 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 so we have -and positive numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do do nothing you are not going to do anything
you just have to what you do have to use paperclips you are right you are actually going to use 3 paperclips you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay what about the stars why do you think there is one star over here and another star .
whichever team gets to the end of the board 1st but which way are they both going the same way no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place but what is going to happen over here you are trying to get to what positive number 10 right over here what are you trying to get to -negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right
usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right you are trying to get to the end so here we have 2 different ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right the other team is going to really want to get negative numbers okay one of the things that we need to do on here what do we call this in between what is right here a line a number line right
so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light what do you think i should probably do before starting the game well yes but i am talking about with the number line yeah label it right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that so what are we going to put here
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10 you got to pay attention isaiah now we are going to label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right the numbers that are greater than 0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers let us label the other side now we are starting with 0
now we are moving to the left what is going to be right here -one -one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0 and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10 so what kind of numbers are they hoping to spin on the spinner
-negative numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner then team one puts the paperclip right on 0 do you see
it fits really well right it lines up so it is the perfect size the small paperclips so we start team one at 0 and we start team 2 at 0 you always have to keep in mind your goal team one is trying to get +10 team 2 is trying to get to -10 and obviously whoever reaches their goal 1st is going to win
this might remind you a little bit kind of like football right where 2 different teams are getting to opposite end zones right
they have to go negativeso then they are behind right so they got -2 now they have 12 steps to try and get over that was a good question so yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2 so now they are at -3 then they got another negative
they are at -4 now they still have to move back up you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right if they are trying to get that way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right and then you have to move this way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right
what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so if you were there yeah you would just stay there till you got a positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10 bradley and isaiah you need to be focused and paying attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop all right so i think we will just divide the class in half
so the back of the class is going to be team 2 the front of the class is going to be team one
so bobby your hand went up 1st you can roll for spin for team 11st come on up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right so he is at 0 if you got +3 where should he move to 3 so you can move right on the line very good so i need someone from team 2
segala come on over you are raising your hand nicely so now what should your team be thinking -negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
come here segala you forgot to move your game piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left left left one space very good now we need another okay rocco your hand came up next yep oh +3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to 6 very good okay
alexander your hand came up 1st so you are thinking -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place all right michael come on up
all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are bradley come on up remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game oh +3 so which way do we have to move so you would go 0 that is 112 okay good job
remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right because we are learning the game noisha come on over be a positive okay +one there you go
okay jasmine come on up oh -2 very good
so wait a minute we are at +2 where should she end up at if she got 0 that is right very good remember from 2 to one is one he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012 okay makes sense all right who has not come up yet kobe come on up
0 okay uhh alicia come on up there is lots of people whose hands are raised you have to be patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you yes 0
nathan come on up what score does team one need to win 33 +3 let us see
yeah get a -3 please +3 so team one won this time this is what we are going to do stop talking we are going to play the game again we are going to switch so the back group is going to be team one the front group is going to be team 2 so what is your goal now positive 10 wait a minute stop for a minute
if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line we are +10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal -10 right where do we need to start both team pieces at 0 okay so team one
isaiah your hand was up 1st so be careful walking around the camera oops so you got -3 oh wait you are going to move your piece on the line very good uhh bobby wait a minute
let me see who has not come up in the front row
angel you have not come up yet come on up that was nice of you bobby to point out who did not go so remember you are thinking negative right +3 hold on no wait a minute that is team one you are team 2 now so okay uhh who has not come up yet orion come on up hi
remember we are going to try and stay quiet and focus on the game so +one so what do you have to do yeah so wait a minute you are on -3 they are moving one so you are at -2 okay who has not come up on this side samantha why do not you come up
so give it a spin okay +2 she did spin it so you are going to move where no +2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment so right now let us stop for a minute team 2 is at +5 right
where are they trying to get to negative not -10 so someone on this front team can you tell me how many spaces away are you from -10 right now
yes what then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers all right alicia did you come up yet yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down
are you saying if you are at 9 and you get 33 then you just move up one and you have won you do not have to get exactly +one okay that was a good question miguel come on up let us see we are both kind of in the wrong place right now right team one is in the negative they want to be in the positive team 2 is in the positive they want to be in the negative table 4 orion you need to be paying attention the whole time
that is +2 +2 yeah hold on wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 very good okay who has not come up yet on this noisha do you come up yet cassidy come on up
cassidy got 0 so we stay right where we are who has not come up in the back nathaniel come on up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is okay juzan come on up
uhh i hope everyone is listening 0 staying right where she is okay does everyone in the back come up anaya come on up let us see let us try to quiet down and focus
remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up arnina and davina i know oh and aaron ready so you are going to try and get a -3 very good you are at 5 so where are you going to go to very good so you are at 2 now
getting better davina come on up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening -2 so you are at 0 so now where do you have to go hey
all right bobby come on up .
+0 okay very good alexander come on up excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now so +2 come over here you have to move
hey kobe come on up he went up once now we are on everyone is 2nd turn so remember what number you are trying to get -one all right wait a minute kobe you are going to move the game piece very good okay oh tire will be next all right alicia come on up
and aaron aaron you will be up next too remember alicia is team one so they are trying to get to +10 right -3 all right wait you got to move it alicia we got negative
okay we will play the game for a couple more minutes and then at that point if we have not gotten anywhere we will look to see who is closest to their goal and that team will be the winner all right +one not -one +one there you go hey aaron come on up table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3
wait a minute yes so you are at -3 where do you need to go to very good okay michael come on up can not move that yep +3 hold on you are going to move it uhh jasmine come on up
i like the way jasmine is sitting quietly i like the way some people are sitting up nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts +2 go ahead very good okay nathan come on up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards
hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward he had +one yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward he did it at 1st and then he went back and fixed it bradley come on up
well but that is not your goal your goal is to get to -10 +3 good brad move it bradley you got to move it you are at 2 so where are you going to move to to the 5 very good hey rocco come on up come on rocco so +one come here
michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom
segala come on up 0 that is okay okay noisha come on up
come over here you are going to move the game board that was 2 you had 712 okay it is almost 10 0 and at that time i wanted to start you playing partners so we have enough time for 2 more people to come up and spin so we need one for team one so anthony come on up yes and then tire you can be the 2nd one so +2
so you are at 5 where do you go very good angel i mean tire sorry sorry angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin -2
okay where were you just now 7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here i need voices off and i need your eyes on the board we said we were stopping the game here now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10 why is team one the winner alexandra
cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so team one is closer to their goal how far away is team one from their goal 3 how far is team 2 from their goal 18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner so does everyone understand how to play the game yes i think i think this game is rigged
do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute that is something you can investigate when you are working with your partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns one of you will be team one the 1st time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch so remember the things you are going to need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips you are going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place
obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right since you are playing against each other what is the vocabulary term for that you are what competitive you are competing but you are what what do we call people who are playing against each other opponents that is right or foe yes another way you could say it is rival who just said that why would you do that
why so yes
yeah so you 2 can play together you 2 can play together anthony can you do me a favor can you pass out 3 paperclips to each pair quickly you 2 will play and you and .
are they up here yes no they are playing and they are playing
who will kobe will play with bobby you are going to be team one and kobe will be team 2 and then you will switch you are not worrying about the other people at the table so alexander you will play with segala
umm bradley anaya you are going to play with isaiah over at the back table come back here
your legs need to be under your desk please okay so let us check i want to see does everyone have the materials they need i am asking you to pay attention right now everyone has 3 paperclips yes
anthony go give them and everyone has a game board you know who you are playing with right where do you need to start your game pieces 00 where is team one is goal what is their goal +10 what is team 2 is goal i am asking you a question what is team 2 is goal -10 all right you can start to play
i am going to be around to watch what you are doing oh bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line some of you already did it label it very good do not forget to label your number line oh you guys already did it great good jood
i see people using the negative numbers label your number line please do you remember to label your number line go ahead and label your number line
i did not do that correctly angel there is no reason to get that loud what is the problem bradley no we need another paper clip you have another one you need another one
they are on my desk make the minus ah very good what side is what
that one is really in half so i would spin again where is this supposed to be you are going to make sure and where is that one supposed to be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
go ahead
one of the things you might have to do when you are doing this is you might have to stand a little bit because if you keep jerking this around your paperclips are going to go everywhere right oh no no no no you know anything you should do
go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet aaron aaron very good whoa whoa whoa where were you
-3 nice you seem like 5 minutes
okay we are going to do that again
let me hold it for now you finished who won 3
so now you are going to switch segala will be team one and you will be team 2 so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10 yes when when i was with the spin orion accidentally put it up and it flanked okay so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior and i think i have said that more than once during this lesson you need to focus on what you are doing
yes then we switch right team if you were team one now you will be team 2 if you were team 2 now you will be team one how is it going
on the bottom okay fine yeah
this is our 2nd game your 2nd how many games have you played 3 who is won so far both times oh you each won once when you are being +10 or -10 you were negative anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
but that shows that you can win when you are negative where are you you are moving in the wrong direction right now so how many places away are you from your goal 20 20 if you are a +10
what is this for i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now
no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at negative oh my
okay 123 let us see who is listening i hear people talking and you should not be i handed you a piece of notebook paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games some of you have played more games than that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game
i heard somebody saying that you thought the game was unfair i want you to tell me why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line what operation or operations okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair okay so right now pick up your paper you can leave the game put the paperclips on the game board and leave it at that desk i will collect them in a minute
head back to your seats
