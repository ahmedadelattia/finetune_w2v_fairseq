okay my math goals reader can you please read the math goals for today students will be able to compare decimals using graphic representation excellent
students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than . and and equal to one another very nice okay so what do we know about decimals so far
think about when we 1st started decimals on friday what did you learn about decimals you can go back into your notes if you need to what did you learn about decimals or what do you know about decimals tan decimal is the fraction that is small
decimal is a fraction please class what else do you know about decimals ban fraction is the number of the smaller so the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction if you have more zeros the smaller the fraction so the smaller the decimal good anything else tiffany what did you learn about decimals it is like money
it is like money what do you mean i can not hear you what do you mean it is like money can you explain your thinking we gave an example on friday about money can you talk about that
what do you mean it is like money what about it is like money exxon that the decimal you use it for money like the decimal you use it for money and other stuff so you are trying to help tiffany out okay tiffany i am coming back to you
how is it like money thank you we talked about it on friday do you remember the example we gave on friday i can not hear you you are right i can not hear you though can you say it louder
we talked about a quarter and how is that like a decimal it is part of a . it is part of a good it is part of a dollar so it is a fraction of a dollar good and one more person tao a decimal is like it represents a fraction and a short way of words
so it is like a fraction and it is a short way of words what do you mean like it represents a fraction so you think it is a shorter way of writing a fraction maybe not shorter but different right okay so who remembers this from friday we talked about this so decimal is a number with a decimal point in it
i think that is what you mean for money tiffany all the digits to the left of the decimal represents whole numbers so 6 is a whole number 0 and 0 these are all whole numbers because they are to the left of the decimal all the numbers to the right of the decimal represent the actual decimal the actual fractional piece
so where is the decimal here in this number ritchie 52 and how would i say that number 5200 good do not forget the 6 let us try to say the whole thing 6 and decimal 6 and 6 and 52
what you said before 5252 what decimal 52 what okay let us try to put the whole thing together 6.526 and and 52 okay by yourself 65200 we are missing something 65201 more time
65200 good and what is the decimal part here hannah
how will i say this 5 tenths 5 tenths when it is a 0 you will need to say 0 okay you just say 5 tenths tricky how do we say this one punk
hannah does he need to say 0 no 100th 100th very nice excellent so today we are going to be comparing decimals but 1st i want you to write down this number and what each place value is so the 2 is in the 1000s place the one is in the 100s place
the 6 and the 10s the 4 and the ones and then we have our decimal so the 5 is in the tenths place and the 7 is in the hundredths place now remember when you are saying your decimal numbers to cover your mouth because you may end up spitting on the person in front of you okay i want to make sure i hear that part
i will give you about 2 minutes to copy that down so we can move on now you do not have to copy it the way that you see it
one more minute no sneezing bless you you got it ritchie let me see okay let us stay here
let us stay here 10 seconds okay you alright you seem a little scared you okay did the camera scare you do not let it scare you
do not worry it is not going anywhere okay it is just regular math class okay okay are we ready stand up if you are ready to move on to the next thing okay alrighty if you did not finish you can copy from the person sitting next to you
so in your groups i have several numbers here you see where each number is underlined i want you to tell me what place is it in okay so in your groups identify which place is it in is it in the ones place is it in the 10s place is it in the tenths place is it in the hundredths place so in your groups get started 5 minutes
work as a group as a group
so far all i hear is tao trying to work with her group but i do not hear any other groups trying to work with each other not independently do not copy it
she is not copying it did we talk about this or did you just put this down on your notebook did you talk about it with hannah tee and magnolia so erase it
i want to have a discussion about it can we talk about it come on come on come
i do not know do you agree that this is the 10s place do you agree
where is the decimal right after here right what is the place that comes after the decimal 2000 10 and after that 100 so what place is this in 100
so this is why you guys need to have a discussion about it this is to help each other out okay wendy what about the next 1000s wendy thinks this is the 1000s place let us have a discussion about this the decimal is here
and where is it okay the decimal is right here yeah and the number is here so what place is this before decimal what place is this ones so this would be the it is right before the decimal right
so what would this be one what would this be ones did you tell me which one reaches in can we write together yeah we do
i do not see it there i do not know how to do it where is the decimal am i pointing to it
what place comes before the decimal one so what would this be 10 what would this be what would this be it seems like you are having trouble working with a group and that can not happen here all of you that is not fair that you are in a group yet you want to be selfish and not share your knowledge with anybody else
why do you think i put you in a group to work together to work together and to help each other are any of you actually doing that are any of you actually doing that yes or no so that means you are not following my directions okay so we need to work how not by ourselves right now
so let us work together okay 2 more minutes to finish this up and then we are going to go over each one what do you think exxon do you agree with all your choices the 4 or the 6
the 6 this is the hundredths why are the arrows pointing towards the wrong number
hannah says this is in the 10s place do we agree because we all have different answers if we are working together we do not have the same answer what do you think tiffany do you agree with her your paper says no what do you think it is what do you think tee
so how is it possible that if i ask you to work together you all have different answers how is that possible tell hannah why you think it is the ones place tell her why not hannah
where is your decimal where is your decimal what is the place before the decimal also 100s and hundredths are spelled very differently so this if you are saying hundredths it would be wrong because you are spelling 100s
you see how it has the ths this has the ths also so erase the ds all right let us go over this let us do the 1st one who can come up here and label what place the 6 is in
come on exxon
okay if you agree with exxon give me a thumbs up if you disagree thumbs down you think they agree with you thumbs up all right next one pass it to somebody else
thumbs up if we agree with tan thumbs down if we disagree okay tan pass it to anybody else they do not have to have their hands raised it is more fun when they do not
come on missus embry are you trying to say the same place as exxon or a different place is it the same place or a different place
same place so you see how he spelled his all right thumbs up if we agree with glendy thumbs down if we disagree okay it looks like everybody agrees with you all right next place
do not forget this side of the room the ones place thumbs up if you agree with tao thumbs down if you disagree hang on let us see who agrees and who disagrees okay good come on tiffany
look at that they are clapping for you and everything alrighty thumbs up if we agree with tiffany that it is in the 100s place thumbs down if you disagree okay let us practice saying these numbers who thinks they can say this one
hannah can you say it a little bit louder 4 and 600s 4 and 600s sounds good to me what about this one magnolia 60
64 and 1818 tenths magnolia says 64 and 18 tenths so think about what the last thing you just said was 18 tenths is that possible which one do you think it is 18
18 what 100s all right let us try that again 64 and 18 hundredths beautiful 64 and 18 hundredths and the next one glendy 4 and 6 hundredths what number is this
6 what number is this 1616 what 100s let us try that again 4 and 16 hundredths 4 and 16 hundredths the next one tee 5 and 83 hundredths 5 and 83 hundredths and last but not least exxon 5 and 13 hundredths 5 and 13 hundredths i love it i love it alrighty
so today we are going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another you are going to be using charts i am going to give 2 to each group these charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another what does it mean to compare
what do you think i mean when i mean to compare decimals think about your goals for today your objective for today what do i want you to do with decimals i will wait because the witnesses seem a little distracted so i will ask my question again what do you think i mean when i say compare when you compare numbers what do you do magnolia compare not quite
exxon 10th she just said the same thing and i said not quite comparing numbers i am not talking about division comparing numbers magnolia can you read the goal again for a language objective so i told everyone to start with decimals r s m greater than and equal to
so i will ask you again what do you think i mean when i say compare decimals what are you going to be doing only tao knows only exxon fang what do you think i am going to be asking you to do magnolia can you read the objective again for fang
i do not think he was listening students will be able to discuss if decimals are less than greater than and equal to one another so what do you think you are going to be doing i can not hear you compare the decimals what does it mean to compare
go back to my initial question tee to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller to see if a decimal is bigger or smaller or equal to another decimal right so here i have 2 examples of decimals you are going to be seeing whether they are smaller bigger or equal to each other
and i want you to use those charts to help you figure it out as a group alright does everyone have those charts okay so we are going to play a group war and how this works is i am going to give you some time to think about it to think about the numbers by yourself
and then you are going to share with your group what you are thinking and then each group is going to have one leader this leader is going to share their thinking with the class but here is the trick each group needs to be prepared to share because you never know which group is going to get called on
alright and 2 groups will be getting called on which means you have to tell me whether you agree or disagree with each other okay so let me show you the practice this is a practice round so i already pre selected these decimals so the decimals that you are comparing is 110th and 12 hundredths
you want to tell me if 110th is less than greater than or equal to 12 hundredths you are going to think about it by yourself for 30 seconds 1st and then when i tell you to share your thoughts with your group that is when you are going to share with your group okay and then i am going to have group one and group 2 so i am going to call the number out
let us see we do not have a 193 jabdiel is group is usually here right he is 3 so group one would be inspectors group 2 would be we do not have a 17
do we have a 15 tiffany is group alright so then inspectors will be talking 1st about what they think and then tiffany is group will be talking about if they agree or disagree with what fang said
now here is the order in which you will go group one goes 1st and then group 2 will follow you never know if group 2 is going to go 1st or group one okay so you have to be on your toes so at this point i want you to pick your leader for your group
okay inspectors who is your leader me who is me witnesses who is your leader exxon and detectives who is your leader beautiful okay we are ready so remember i am going to give you 30 seconds to think about it by yourself
and then you are going to share your thinking with your leader so your leader is going to take all the knowledge that you have given him plus or her plus their own and have a discussion about it are we ready okay so here is the 1st 2 cards so i want you to think about it 1st put it in your notebooks what you are thinking
remember you can use that chart that i gave you to help you compare them maybe you want to color in 67 hundredths and color in 5 tenths to see which one is greater okay now i want you to discuss it as a group
i will give you about one to 2 minutes to discuss it you need to tell me why is it bigger why is it smaller why is it equal to the other number you do not need to copy what i have on the board
all you need to do is explain
use this to help you
use one at time so do not use that one yet did you guys use a chart to help figure it out
30 seconds
okay what do you think and then color and model
tenths not 10s tenths do not spit at her
okay let us see which group is group one
let us see who is group 2 okay let us see who is up 1st group 2 explain your thinking come on
can you speak louder because that group needs to agree disagree or .
which one is smaller or bigger i think 6700 again louder because you are talking to that group you are not talking to your notebook
i think the number 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths because 6700 is called a 100th and 5 tenths is called a 10th so the 100th is bigger than 10th okay what do you think
we agree can you speak louder we agree because i can not hear you we agree because we also think 6700 is bigger 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths natan said something interesting he said hundredths is bigger than tenths is that true is that true
do you remember exxon is cake on friday that we cut it remember i gave the example of exxon is cake we cut it into hundredths pieces were the pieces bigger no no so the bigger the denominator you said that earlier the more zeros you add to it the smaller the number so think about what you said i know what you meant but hundredths is not bigger than tenths it depends on the situation okay
you know what i mean okay and what do you guys think do you agree with these 2 groups that 6700 is bigger than 5 tenths tiffany you did a graphic representation can i see it so on the charts they actually colored in the 5 tenths and the 6700 which coloring is bigger exxon hundredths can you say the number
6700 so the 6700 is closer to a whole correct so therefore it is bigger very nice are you ready for our next round okay so this is 30 seconds of wait time
okay now share your thinking with your group
i do not know what the question is i put it right there it is like what question was it can you repeat what he said gwendy gwendy was not listening to you ethan
did not that mean say it again and then repeat after him say it again and then repeat after him
i think the 1st time was too much for me okay share them with our groups now what we think
i did not hear it no i did not did you color in 5 tenths correctly is that a new one or is that the old 14 tenths and 4th 800s okay i thought you colored in the old one
no
let us do a different one we do not have that okay are we ready let us see which group is up 1st group one you are up 1st i think . louder exxon wants to hear you
he is ready to fight i know exxon he loves to argue
the 1300 is 40 and 40 is bigger than 4 if you add more 0 the number becomes 4 i respectfully disagree why do you respectfully disagree because if you they are the same because if you just put the 0 they will be the same and if you and if you like here it will be the same too it is the same it shows the same tan he is talking to fang do you mind being quiet can you repeat that again because she kept talking because when you are going to do they are the same because they show the same representation
if you are going to color it you have to color both of those 4 sides so they are the same okay tiffany what do you think you agree or disagree who do you agree with i agree with group 2 you agree with group 2 now tiffany also colored in i like that tiffany keeps using graphic representations because it helps prove your point a little bit better she colored in 4 tenths right
she also colored in 40 hundredths where do they stop do they stop in the same place yes so 4 tenths is still 6 tenths away from a whole and 40 hundredths is 60 hundredths away from a whole so they are actually equal good job group 2 alrighty and one more round
are we ready i told you exxon is going to aruge it is a hard one it is a hard one because we have not talked about thousandths yet
try to figure this out
is this a little tricky part 2 because if you add another 0 to the 222 hundredths and there is like a 5 over there and 5 is bigger than the 0 so i think it is like part 2 is bigger than part 2 wow
what do you think i think it is closer to part 2 why because ritchie what do you think
she got my idea it is a very good idea alrighty it is my favorite part are we ready let us see who group one is
okay let us see which group is up 1st group 2 detectives you are up 1st what do you think can you speak louder tiffany we think it is part 2 because we think part 2 is what
okay
then what
how how do you know that let us see what the other group thinks we agree that the answer is part 2 the answer is part 2 what answer
225 225 is is bigger than 2200 why think about what tao said
because if you add a 0 to 200 still the 5 will be bigger than 0 so what number would this be 200 200 200000s and this would be 225000 which one of those is bigger 225000
225000 is bigger than 220000 right so you are correct part 2 is bigger and i like the way that you guys thought about it also so you are just bringing me on to what i was going to explain to you so let us go back to these 2 decimals that we talked about earlier sometimes you do not even need a graphic representation to help you figure out how to compare decimals
the 1st thing you do is you line up your decimals so that they are one on top of the other are my decimals on top of each other it makes it easier to compare then we look at our ones place what are the numbers in our ones place glendy and can i compare that no that does not help me then i move to my tenths place tan what are the numbers in my tenths place
and 2 and what is the number in my tenths place and does that help me no what about in the 100s place magnolia 11 and 5 does that help me compare
yes or no okay which one of these is bigger 7 or 5 ritchie 7 the 7 is bigger therefore this number is bigger than 5 so 27 hundredths is bigger than 25 hundredths okay so now what i want you to do is i want you to look at the back of the room
i have 2 decimals on the board 37 hundredths and 4 tenths i want you to tell me if it is less than greater than or equal to in your notebooks by yourself
i am coming i am coming is it less than greater than or equal to
there are also still charts on your desk if you need the support this is bigger than this
use this use those charts to help you where is yours
okay which one is bigger good
it is a weird looking symbol okay who wants to share their thinking who wants to share their thinking so far i have walked around and i think i like what i see tao
i think 0.37 how do we say that number 37 hundredths hundredths good it is greater than 4 tenths and 4 hundredths and 4 hundredths it is greater than 0.37
you said 0.37 is greater than 4 tenths is that what you mean to say so you think this number is bigger than this number exxon i also disagree because if you put the 7 to the 4 that will be bigger you can not just add 7s what is a number that you can add that does not change
okay and which one of those is bigger 47 hundredths what is this number 40 hundredths okay if you think that this number is smaller stand up
tao you change your mind i said that 4 hundredths is bigger than 0.37 you know what you said at 1st that 0.37 is bigger than 4 tenths that is what you said you did not mean that but you said that that is okay we make mistakes all the time you know i make mistakes every single day 27000 times a day so you are correct
37 hundredths is smaller than 4 tenths you know what i saw when i came around this is what glendy did she did exactly what i just showed her she looked at the zeros she said the zeros do not help me and then she looked at the 3 and the 4 and i asked her which one is bigger and she said 4 tenths is bigger because 4 is bigger than 3 and she is correct good job excellent work everybody
okay let us close our notebooks and let us get ready for our trip
