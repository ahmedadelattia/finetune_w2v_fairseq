so this is number 312 recording today is february 8th is that right and it is 11 30 this is math time okay let us see
so i think you still remember this and we are just going to quickly go over what we have covered last time or yesterday okay does anyone remember what jackie said about these numbers comparing these 2 neighborhoods okay someone besides jackie okay cole
the white cells you add up the yes and the no for a total and that would be equal to 100 so it would be 3.01 over 100
okay unintelligible to add up and then to see at over 70 okay
okay unintelligible a 100 over 34 over 100 okay so what makes this easier for us to compare percent okay kevin because what about the denominator they share the same denominator they share the same denominator right
okay so this is 100s this is also okay in 100s and which one is larger now louis unintelligible right
okay so that and that means and then the next thing we said last time was when something is out of 100 or per 100 okay amy what do we call that do you remember per percento percent right so what percent is this 31% this is 31% okay and dylan
34% this is 34% of the people who said yes right yeah okay so now can we compare yes this is very easy to compare right yes so this neighborhood had more people who said yes okay but if you just look at the numbers 31 17 it is very easy to say oh yeah of course this is more 31 but then that is 17
okay but in fact you have to look at the whole thing right everything okay so remember this and this is one strategy when you compare percents or change fractions into percents
this is one way okay maybe i will have you write down some methods or strategies in your notebook okay and what is this strategy
okay can someone explain this so how do you turn this fraction into a percent or how do we turn these numbers you know 31 out of the total into a percent selina we divide the denominator by the numerator okay did we divide we did not divide yeah so what did we do unintelligible
add the yes and you add the no together and then if it is a 100 then we can put the yes on top of the no okay so we make a fraction that has a denominator of what
okay a fraction with a denominator of okay 100 right so this is for converting for making a percent okay all right what is another one
so as long as we can get a denominator to be equal to 100 and we have the equivalent fraction then we have the percent okay is there another way to make this did we do something else here here is another fraction what happened there we made an equivalent fraction right we made an equivalent fraction okay
so how should we word this okay like make equivalent fraction right and what about that equivalent fraction it has to have a numerator a denominator of .
okay with a denominator okay of 100 and can you write this word down i do not know if you have heard of this okay this is called scale or scaling scale up scale down
it is like you know simplifying finding equivalent fraction okay so here the example would be okay we scaled 17 over 50 up to 34 over 100 okay does that make sense
okay why do you think we use the word scale do you remember when we used have we used this word before in science math
what else
okay so you can scale up right and you can scale down okay but why scale where else did we use scale back in the fall maps maps right remember those maps you made okay the large ones you scaled them down to smaller versions right so that is kind of scaling and when you scale what happens
do you change the shape or the you know the color okay you basically ..
you just change the size and everything stays the same right when you scale something down it still looks the same as the original but smaller okay so when we scale the fraction up what does that mean it is still the same fraction but you know it kind of it looks larger but it is not really larger when you look at the ratio so if this is maybe i can give you an example
one to 2 we can scale it up to how can we make a percent percent 10 over 20 does that help us make the percent remember per 100 okay we want a numerator denominator of 100 right
okay now we scale this up to 50 over 100 but if you look at the relationship this is a one to 2 this is half of that right now is that half of that yes they are still the same they are still equal okay right so kind of get used to this word okay scale up scale down okay when you scale down what does that mean
let me give you an example okay so 15 over 18 okay maybe divide it by 6 okay so this is scaling down right it is like simplifying okay
and sometimes actually this is not a good example we will look at it in a few minutes sometimes you will have to scale down okay in order to scale up to go to 100 but this actually does not this is not a good example
let me give you another one see if this works no how about how about this
so how can we turn this into 100 or is it possible or is it not possible not possible 12 does not go into 100 evenly right okay
does this make sense yes so scale down and then scale up okay okay sometimes you will have to do that you simplify it and then you will be able to find the 100 okay as the denominator in this case okay it does not work and we will come back to this okay so we will talk about that and that will be actually our strategy number 3 okay
so 12 and we will come back to this okay now yesterday you also did a fraction bar or a percent bar okay so let us take a quick look at number one
and what is the total what is the 100% what number for yao ming 7474 no what is the number what is the number of 3 what are the number of attempts 371371 right is that right yeah okay and for shaquille 0 neal the total
725725 okay so can we just kind of look at this and figure out a strategy for estimating or calculating the percentage of free throws okay so how many did yao ming make
301 301 okay and how many did shaquille make 451451 so by just looking at the numbers can we say oh of course shaquille 0 neal is a better is better at free throw no okay and why not
okay dylan why not
okay did you say 451 out of 725 yes and this is out of 771 and you said that the gap you mean the difference between these 2 okay it is bigger than this okay all right do you agree or disagree
so when we look at these numbers we can not just say oh 451 is more you know but we have to look at the total right the total okay so what are some strategies for estimating what are some strategies we want to find out the the percent right so what are some strategies yes
how about using a benchmark number how about using landmark or benchmark numbers right okay so how do you what what is a good number to to round to 300 is this close to 300 yes and we say well let us try 300 okay out of now remember we have to find numbers that are easy to work with okay
not just numbers that are very close so we have 370 350 400 okay so what is a what is a good number to use 350 how about 350 let us try 350 okay
now 300 out of 350 okay so what can we divide this into okay lawrence we divide it into sevenths okay does that work sevenths yes so 123456 sevenths okay and where would the 300 be 6 sevenths
well if we divide this into 3 sevenths the 1st one would be 5050 right okay 12 350 200 300 300 okay and this is 350 so it would be somewhere over here right yes okay so let us put a star here okay what about this number
what numbers can we use 450 okay does 450 work over 7 750 okay now remember we we want to find numbers that are easy to work with 750 okay 750
can we okay 7 720 well that is close i do not know if that will work why did say why did someone say 720 i think that is a very good number to use i think 720 because it is a multiple of a number 720 is a multiple of a number what number
a multiple of 566 129 how about this one we want the same multiple right we want to be able to find you know to to scale it down or up 99 is that a multiple of 9 yes 9 yes 5 so does that mean we can do 9s yes oh yeah okay
i am not very good at 9s but oh that does not work so what what is what are some strategies remember we talked about making 9s by the thirds thirds very good okay and then into thirds again right yes
much better okay so where is 7 where is 720 it would be right here what about 450 if these are 9s you divide 720 by 9 so each one is 505090908080 right
8 times 9 is 7 72 so 80 160 and where would 450 be number 44 right there 40480 right in the middle of the 480 right in the middle of the 100 around here
okay all right let us get the rest of these so what is the next 156560 and 64640 right so where is 450 between 400 and 40 and 180 right there somewhere over there okay it is 140 all right okay so it is closer all right it is closer to 100 okay
so i i think these are very close estimates and can we tell by just looking at the 2 lines that yao ming is actually closer to 100% than shaquille 0 neal okay so there is another strategy you make a fraction bar or a percent bar okay now what about the let us see what about half
so did anyone use other strategies you say i am not going to do rounding maybe i will do halves i will do use benchmark fractions does that work so let us say this is yao this is yao ming is 371 shaquille is 725 can we use some benchmarks
so here says what would be 50% 50% that is half and what number would that be about about 118518185180 is that about 185 is that close enough yes okay and what about here 360
360 about 3622 okay 365 all right so how does this help now we know half way is about 150 185 and then that is about 360 does that help can that help us figure out you know where each person was no no
what are we trying to find we are trying to find a spot for that number right where does 301 belong on this line does this help us no well can we at least say that it is on this side or it is on this side yes yeah it is on this side right and how about shaquille
it is also on the right so that does not really help
oh good idea okay so now let us do fourths now what would be half half of that 92 okay 92 and this is about 180 yeah close enough okay so 184 okay how about over here you want to be exact
okay all right how about over here so we add another 4292 to that right 272270 272 and here 5454340 wow okay now can does this help where is 301
half and a half it would be between 270 and 371 right yes so somewhere over here how about 451 in between yeah it would be between these 2 between one half and 3 fourths so so does this help us
yes yes okay yes i was exact right okay so if you use benchmark numbers you should be able to okay let us say if this does not work then we can break it down into even smaller parts right but this strategy works okay so we use a fraction the percent bar
okay let us let us take a look at that that last one and i think that is a very good question do you agree or do you disagree okay this person alicia said yao ming made 301 free throws and shaquille 0 neal made 451 so shaquille 0 neal has the better record okay
agree disagree okay raise your hand marlene i disagree because shaquille 0 neal had an elbow but not shaquille so so you disagree that means what does that mean that yao ming has a better record yes
okay does anyone disagree with marlene is statement and that means you agree with alicia is in other words can we say that shaquille actually has the better record no so you all agree with marlene yes okay but what is the difference if you look at these 2 numbers
just the ones in purple not the denominator just the what are these numbers these are the free throws that they made right so he made yao ming made that many shaquille 0 neal made that many is it possible to argue that he is better he has a better record
yes because you it depends because you do not know the denominator okay all right because you do not know the denominator because well we do know do not we we do know okay yes but it you know we do know the denominator so yes
i just i recognize this right now but like you could say that yao ming has more because if you -3 72 301 then you only have like only like 70 left like any missed
and then if you -125 or 451 you will have a lot more than okay how many 202 hundered and 76
okay so you are saying that shaquille missed many more shots than yao ming so he is better okay is that right yeah in terms of okay anyone else any other comments well i actually noticed something about finding the percentage okay
that the lower the number the low the lower the numerator and denominator is the higher percentage okay say that one more time please the high the lower the numerator and denominator are the higher the percentage is
okay the lower the denominator then the cole the denominator yeah and the numerator oh and the numerator the higher the percentage it is okay i do not quite understand what do you mean the lower
so how about fraction like 13rd these are low right does that mean it is a higher percentage what determines i think cole brought up a good point okay what determines the the higher a higher percentage how do we know that it is a higher percentage
just by looking at the numerator and the denominator is there a way to tell is there a way to tell yeah rachel a higher numerator because then no the numerator should be very high because it has to be like close to the numerator to the denominator say that one more time for me it has to be of course the numerator to the denominator
okay so can we say that when the numerator is very close to the denominator that the percentage is higher yes okay all right keep that in mind okay i think that is a very good point
okay so what i would like you to think about now is the other strategies that you wrote down okay the 2nd and the 3rd okay so this is one strategy right so we actually did we write that down estimate rounding okay maybe we can write this down too okay
so this is not finding the exact percentage but we can estimate right by by what yes by rounding and using benchmark numbers yes
okay all right so this is a strategy for estimating not finding the exact okay so let us think about what .
let us see what i wrote up here okay so i will i will transfer this over okay you all set with this okay when you estimate you round we can also use i think we did use .
fraction or percent bars right okay what happens when you have when you cannot use any any of these strategies okay
let us say there is a fraction but you can not round the you can not make the numerator into 100 you cannot scale up or down you know to get to 100 and and then you cannot estimate because you want the exact answer okay then what do you do let me give you a simple example how about one out of 3
can we scale this up or down to make this 100 into 100 yes or no yes okay how does this work boys and girls no
we can have 26s 39s one over 30 but how do we get to a 100 we can not not close to 33 right not evenly right okay so this is an example now what happens when you need to make a percent then you you can not estimate then it is that is a problem okay
and this is when the next strategy comes in handy okay so say that one more time okay yeah
all right okay selina said you can divide a numerator okay and please write this down divide a denominator and when you do that remember we did this before yes what do you get when you do that
you have a decimal right okay so when you have the decimal and then what how do you make it into a percent you turn it into a percent okay and we will we will practice okay did you write this down
okay so when you cannot do any of the other use any of the other strategies you use this one okay and and it always works okay with this one you divide a numerator by the denominator okay then you look at this let us look at the same example they are all one over 3 okay so it is 3 divided by one so it is 3
3% no it is 33 well one out of 3 how can that be 3% right that does not make sense because you do 3 divided by one are we dividing 3 by one no okay i know it does not look very it does not look right but we remember this when we did this
when you write the fraction this way dylan yeah one divided one over 3 and what does this symbol mean divide on the keyboard the computer keyboard that means divide right so when you write you can write it like this so this is the same as that same as that right yes or no yes does this make sense
yes so how do you divide one by 30 and i think we did this okay put a 0 put a 0 so this is one and 0 tenths 3 goes into 10th that how many times 33 tenths right no so this is 110th if we do the standard way then what happens
after a while you notice that it repeats right okay so whenever it repeats then you do not have to go on because it will not stop okay and we put the little line okay above this and that means it repeats okay so 13rd is the same as
0.30.3 with that bar notation okay at the top now that is only a decimal so how do we turn the decimal into a percent we move the decimal if you do not put you move 2 spaces back which is it is 0.33 that is 33 but since it is only .3 you put 13rd into it
okay and that is what we did i think last month instead of writing the decimal especially when it repeats we made we did not use the remainder right what happened marlene so we turned that into a fraction a fraction okay now this repeats so this is a remainder i am not going to continue because it does not stop
okay and then what do you do you put the 13rd at the top here right and 3rd so this decimal is and is it should we do 0.3 and a 3rd no or 3333 okay 33 because we as jackie said you have to move the decimal point how many spaces
22 okay to the right right okay so that means over okay so this is the exact decimal right that is not estimating that is not rounding and you turn it into a percent
33 okay and of course you think about it does it make sense 13rd is that about 33% 333333 that is about a 100 right okay all right so let me have you practice
okay take a look at the next page and remember sometimes okay you have to scale up scale down and if it does not work then you use this last strategy okay on page 57 the portland tigers are playing the cold water colts colts in basketball
the game is tied 58 to 58 but in the excitement both coaches step onto the court just as the buzzer sounds a referee calls a technical foul on each coach so each coach has to choose one player to make the free throw attempt
the winning team may be determined by the free throw and the question is you know who does the coach choose right and here are some statistics so for angela angela is history okay when you know she made the free throw so she made 12 out of 15 free throws
emily made 15 out of 20 christina 13 out of 16 so which player should the coach select to make the free throw attempt and explain your reasoning okay so i want you to do this in your notebook
i want you to figure out you know each one and maybe what is the strategy how do we i mean can we just look at these numbers and say oh this is the best person in free throw so what do you do we have to show our work
okay you show your work show your thinking but how do you determine you know who okay so you will have to do some math to find percent right or equivalent fraction so you can compare okay lawrence can you make them so they have numerators of a 100
okay you can try to make them so that they all have a 100 you know as a numerator denominator or numerator denominator denominator okay
so go ahead and do it in your notebook okay and let me know if you have any questions
okay isabella why are you multiplying this by 20 because 15 oh probably 15 equals 4 and to get one a denominator of 100 you have to multiply by 20 so when you multiply something by 20 does it get 20 times as much no it stays the same because we are scaling up
okay i see what you are doing but if you write it like this that means you multiply this by 20 that means you make this 20 times more so what is the what is the right way to write that you multiply this by 20 and you multiply this by 20 also like a numerator and how is that different
20 versus 20 over 20 because that shows that you are multiplying each one by 20 if you do that you are just multiplying that whole thing 20 times 20 times right okay why do you think christina is the best at free throw yeah because they are both the same
because the quickest way to do it that i found out was 3 +3 equals 16 that is 2 it is the easy way if you use if 13 goes into 16 even if these 2 have 3 she had more time to go for free throws than 13
so she got 13 out of 16 and it would be a little it would just be a little bit the percentage would just be a little bit more than this because this has a more because she had more time and then she had 13 okay they had different right that is very good thinking but if you look at the the numbers of attempts okay they all did different they they they used different numbers right
yes so how can you figure out the exact percent for angela the exact for emily can you use any of those strategies you could divide the denominator by the denominator okay now before you do that can we use the other strategies
sometimes those are easier okay than dividing right remember we are trying to find fractions that have a denominator of of 150 or like a benchmark 25 right yes so can you turn that into a 100 is that 12 out of 15 maybe you can write it down and yeah put it on this page so we can see so for angela 12 out of 15
can you turn 15 12 over 15 into something over 100 does 15 go into 100 evenly no no right so that 1st strategy okay that does not work can we try the try the other one try to scale it up scale it down down and up
if you scale it up it would be 24 over 30 right but will you eventually get to 100 try to scale it down and see if that works
so do 12 over 15 equal
okay are you trying to use a percent bar yeah that is okay because 15 goes into 106 times is it exactly 6 times no okay but we want exact numbers is there another way to remember the strategies that we talked about like 15 to 10 and then
yeah can you try to scale it up scale it down yeah
sometimes you will have to go down before you can go up see that good because 5 times 20 equals
yes and 3 times 20 equals 60 okay now why is that a 3 because 12 times 4 okay and a 3 times 4 equals 12 right so 5 times 4 is that 20 that is not 20
okay check this 12 over 15 this is dividing by 3 right this is dividing by 3 so when you divide 15 by 3 it is 5 when you divide 12 by 3 oh so 4
does that work so how many percent is that 80% good so that is an example of scaling down okay in order to go back up right
good good okay how did you do this one ming the common factor okay so what do you mean tell me more what do you mean common factor is that emily 15 out of 20 so what is that
15 out of 20 so oh i see can you do a fraction line a fraction bar so you see a fraction in other words you turn that into a fraction does that work little boy i did 20 out of 15 out of 15 i made this 20 because if it is rounded down it will be 10 okay so i got 20 oh and now now we can not round okay
why not we need the exact number right okay so when you round you estimate so we are not estimating can you write that fraction here 12 over 15 equal and we are trying to find a fraction that has a 100 at the bottom right it is not a factor of a 100 it is good so then so let us try those strategies
how about the 2nd one by scaling can you scale down scale down that means make these 2 numbers smaller but yet they still equal the same okay good good okay
do you think that works yeah so i have 100 times 12 and what times 12 i have 100 times 12 did you get that exactly and what percent is that
80% so this is a case when you have to round that not round but scale them before you can get to 100 right that is good so so angela that is 80% okay can you explain this to me this is 15 over 20 20 so these are common factors they both have 5 good
so 15 times 5 equals 75 so i turn it into a fraction 20 times 5 equals 100 so i turn this into a fraction okay and then 75 out of 100 that is 75 75% very good are you trying to use the same way to find emily or are you using a different strategy okay i am using a all right remember i used the i did it let us see
so this one is both and this one is okay what do you mean both tell me because 15 out of i put equal because if i round it all up to the 20 so i put 15 +5 will equal 20 so i put 12 +5 now why did you round up when do we round remember when we do you need this i am all set you are set there yeah thank you okay i am going to recycle that
okay thanks ms fong so why do you why why do you need to round we are not rounding are we when are we estimating here so this is not estimating okay so you can not round but can can you write it as a fraction ms fong just put put it down here okay so 12 out of 15 make a fraction
it is not the same 12 over 15 good it is 2 away and can you use any of those strategies
scaling up and down turning the denominator into a 100 did that work
can you tell me what you did cause 12 over 15 equals 4 fifths 15th equals 8 over a 100 good and then now do you know the percent 8% good now okay so that is the 2nd strategy now what if this does not work then what do you have to do .
what is the last one divide the numerator okay i need you to show your work how did you get 80% how did you get do not erase it just show how you got those numbers okay
what do you mean 5 emily has 5 left 5 shots so she missed 5 shots and then christina missed 33 so so you are trying to say that this person missed the least therefore
no because angela also missed 3 but christina had more free throws and angela had less so christina would have had a better chance okay now how about someone who missed one free throw do you think that would be like even better than christina i only missed one does that mean i am better than christina
no no but i only tried once oh that does not yeah so what does that mean can we can you determine by these numbers the number that they missed carmen carmen or bobby carmen not right now dylan okay just wait please
does that work bobby 10 attempts right carmen so so how so what do you have to do you need to find the 8 out of 10 exact percent right 10 exact percent 18 out of 10 attempts can you go back and yep
so angela is a 12 out of 15 can you write 12 over 15 exactly you see that is a fraction out of this not out of the whole
okay we are going to take a few more minutes boys and girls but i one thing i need you to do is to make sure that you write the fraction you show your work okay you that you do not estimate okay we are not estimating so you need the exact fraction percent okay where is the 1st one
all right so how many percent is this 75 okay and how did you know because i changed it into a fraction which is 3 fourths right so what is re this is 3 fourths how did you make that into a 34th i i scaled it to 66 over i believe 8 all right now 6 that is half of that right
is 8 half of that no are we estimating yes okay so we can not use anything that is close to but i think you have the you have the right idea lewis so can you scale it differently okay maybe you can just write the fraction here and try to reduce it try to scale it
okay can you scale it down yes or simplify simplify it down to 6 okay okay does that work that is half of that and i do not think so half of 15
is that an even number no a whole number no so we can not do that try another number you can do let us see 4 okay okay divided by 3 good so that is worth this right now does that help
yes how do you go from here to the percent how accurate are these parts is this exactly the same as that 80% okay good because these are very close and how do you know if you did these lines accurately
you can tell that she is a little bit better than angela right but are you sure that you divided these evenly that this is not a little bit more than that how about using some numbers this is a good strategy okay
now since these are so close can you try to use some numbers to figure out okay boys and girls we have a couple more minutes
let me have your attention okay just for a minute up here all right we let us look at the problem okay so for angela okay since we are not estimating okay i need you to find the exact number okay so what is the what is the fraction there how many out of how many okay kevin
all right and you want to find a remember those strategies can we find a fraction that has a 100 yes okay so if 15 does 15 go into 100 evenly no okay if not then we will have to use another strategy right using the scaling up and down so we can scale this down
listening please simon scale it down to okay does that work divided by 3 divided by 3 and then can you scale it up 5 can go into 100 right
okay and now we have a fraction eyes up here alphonsus okay now for the other 2 people you need to do the same thing so emily and christina
what do you notice about the last one okay can we use the same strategy can we scale down can we scale up does 16 go into 100 now that means strategy one does not work strategy 2 does not work and we can not estimate that strategy 3 so we have to go to the last one right
for something like this you will have to divide okay and then you find a decimal turn it into like this
