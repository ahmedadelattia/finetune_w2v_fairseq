thank you thank you very much this is turned on too right okay alright got everybody seated is everybody in a place where they can see where they can participate boys can you see there okay we need to do calendar for 2 days we did not do it yesterday so we are going to add 2 days starting with to our number line yesterday was the 100 and ninth day of school and today is the 110th day of school
how many days until the end of the school year
can you write a fraction 1st of all representing .
the 1st thing you are going to do is write a fraction showing how many days we have been in school so far and we are going to spend just about 10 minutes doing calendar we may not get to everything show me the fraction that tells us how many days we have been in school so far well that is just exciting huh but no snow days yet can you reduce that
what is one clue that you can reduce that they are both even they are both even so you know they are going to be divisible by 2 while we are doing this do any of our numbers need part
110 do you need to circle 110 yes i do need to circle 110 think if we can reduce more look and see yes i need to circle 110 how many more circles will i have before the end of this school year 7 more kay do either of them get a triangle no square no star yes
kay
that was a good try hexagon no day of the week chart
no no octagon
9 dice
okay so that is it so a 109 did not get anything 110 had 2 factors alright was anybody i think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms look around show your elbow partner what your answer was i see a lot of equivalent fractions what would you guys get i i i i .
what was the reduce one what was the lowest you could go 11 over 1811 over 18 that was pretty interesting could you show me the fraction of the days we still ha so we could say we have had 11 eighteenths of our school year already that is pretty what fraction tells us how much to go how many more days to go 80 more right no fraction show me in a fraction we have already said there is 70 days and if it has zeroes what can you do reduce it
reduce it and they are both divisi and do you remember i see a lot of 35 over 90 so what i want you to do is to look both at 35 and at nintey see if it can be see if they have any factors in common
7 eighteenths left in the school year that is what i got too 7 eighteenths and 11 eigteenths those were the 2 numbers could you compare them using a less than greater than or equal to symbol compare the fraction that is showing the days we have already done the days we have left m kay good deal
alright let us take a look at a couple new things i want to show you the 1st thing i want us to do is we are going to add we are going to talk about our decimal we now have a mixed number do not we so i am going to color 2 days and i wonder if you see a couple different ways that we could write it we can create an equivalent decimal look at what i am doing
i have colored a full 10 colored another 10 show me a couple different ways to represent this number what about using a decimal point good here is one way who has a different way colby has 2 ways we have got one and 10 hundredths we also have one one which is one and 110th i see some fractions good job
okay can you show me the percent what would the percent be what would the percent be
a 110% if somebody tells you that you give a 110% that is what it would look like if you were drawing a picture even though it does not go that high it is supposed to be a 100% right
right okay let us take a look at our february calendar trying to think what was in here and i have some new pictures when is my next birthday in february huh
0 the 30 and 31 from january i still have up there alright who is our next birthday
eunice when is your birthday monday 4th is saturday right okay so we will sing tomorrow but let us take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month you are going to like these there is a couple different patterns going on let me show you the one for the 1st we are going to do it for yesterday and for today
it will take a while to see the pattern will not it and what we will do is we will do it for the weekend and for monday okay this is our 1st one take a look at you should be looking at my picture right now okay we are going to put this down because i want you to look at my picture who can describe this can you see it
okay so we have got a cube turn to your elbow partner and tell them something about a cube what do you notice is under the number one
do we know what that means yet valentine is day it is a smile and a heart maybe it is part of the pattern it is it is going to be related to the pattern but we have not seen enough yet joey what did you tell your par your partner about a cube
listen up 0 boxes can be shaped like a cube what else can boxes be shaped like look at me joey okay not at them what else what else can what other shape can boxes be made into think of a cereal box a rectangle rectangular prism what else
okay straight lines in straight lines in them or curved lines
tell me what this picture is this is the one for today gary your eyes should be up here this is a rectangular prism tell me tell me how it is different well 1st of all how are they the same how are rectangular prisms and cubes the same tell me one way i like how matthew has his hand raised quadrilateral huh quadrilateral well they are not quadrilaterals but they are faces maybe because remember they are 3 dimensional so how many faces are there
6 think of a dice or a box how many sides are there
okay so those faces the 2 dimensional ones would be quadrilaterals what else what else luke they have the same number of edges they have the same number of edges what else do they have the same number of corners corners m kay who sees something else they have the same number of vertices vertices which is another word for what bottom nobody should be writing anything right now your eyes should be looking at those 2 pictures
girls your eyes should be looking at my 2 pictures vertices is the same thing as points points corners also they have the same number of faces which are going to be your flat surfaces alright do we have enough really to be able to talk about what our pattern is going to be
yeah we do not really have enough pictures to see what could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month audrey each heart could be an odd number but tell me what you think the picture is going to be 3 dimensional 3 dimensional shapes or solids alright the next thing we are going to do is we are going to play a game i know you guys were disappointed that number crunch went away for a little bit we are going to play a probability game the name of this game is going to be 120 spins
and what we are going to do is i have 2 spinners up here and every day we are going to take the spinner going to let a girl spin it 6 times a boy spin it 6 times and then we are going to talk we are going to graph the results up here in a tally chart who has a prediction about what the what the results are going to be or anything related to this experiment what do you think luke take a couple of predictions
yellow will mostly likely get the most tallies okay yellow let me put this back up here so that you can see nobody should be writing anything at this point if i see you with your whiteboard i will think that you are not with me okay so put it a place where you can see charlie we are going to wait for you so that you can look up here luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most tallies okay
and i am just going to do a few predictions today because i want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of of february yellow most likely put a thumb up if you agree with that most likely will have the most going to need someone to help me with this okay who has another prediction josh
since you just jinxed it i think red will i think red will be the be the best since once you spin it and you probably spin it at the red or the blue it will probably go around and and stop on where the red is well and let me just stop you for just a minute hey luke why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most cause it has 2 squares yeah let us take a look at this folks i want you to look at at what my spinner looks like
how can we describe my spinner by the way what could we say the yellow part is 2 fourths yeah we could say that 2 fourths of it is shaded do have an equal amount of shading like is it 3 equal colors no no okay so we could say one half or 2 fourths are shaded yellow red is 14th blue is 14th so do you see where luke may have gotten that prediction in a spinner game he thinks that more than likely will land quite a bit there
but josh says red will have the most because you guys just jinxed it what do y what does that even mean
jinx bad luck it means it probably do the exact opposite of what you think you think well maybe you jinxed it and it is going to be blue 0 my goodness everybody is jinxing it blue is going to have the most
okay make your predictions based on what you know about math and spinner games m kay we probably need to be thinking that way not necessarily jinxing and stuff like that blue will have the most i am going to take one more i want a lady this time
okay i am going to write today is date too madison i think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins 0 good prediction
madison said okay i said i was only going to take one more so put your hands down we got to move on blue plus red will equal what
yellow okay let me find someone who has been on task i am going to pick a girl and a boy alright and do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner yes alright so what i am going to do put your hand down please i am going to take it to a hard surface can i see someone does anyone have a pencil closeby charlie can you grab a pencil from your desk thank you bud alright what you are going to do is you are going to take it to a flat surface just one of the areas close by
you take the pencil point you put the spinner put it or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner boom now you got to move your hand out of the way and what you are going to do is you are go we are going to count you will let me know how many yellows you had how many reds and how many blues okay alright let us see .
you do your 6 maybe those boys can help you count and i think i am going to let laura do this spinner okay alright so watch watch whoever is closest to you watch whoever is closest to you you need you want to borrow charlie is pencil here you g 0 goodness i almost got you you guys remember how to make tallies 1234 and then you strike across
brandon if you need to go and do the blinds he got yellow yellow sit down sit down brandon you can go get it out of your eyes go do the blinds okay what would you get boys
tell me what you got kiddo 4 yellows one red one blue 4 yellows okay let us look at what he got 4 yellows 1234 let me get someone else to help me jasmine you are going to help me tally what else was it one one red red and one blue okay laura is spinner what was yours 3 yellows okay so you are going to go strike across
232 reds 2 reds and one blue and one blue alright so let us take a look right now we have 56789101112 we have done 12 spins 0 actually i think we were only supposed to do 20 to do 6 a day 0 well that is okay we will do it for monday we got excited alright so we have 567 yellows 2 blues and 3 reds
is that about what we said might happen whose prediction is that close to
0 that is right that is why i did it twice okay thank you
3 wait no no never mind
it was close is it close 3 +2 is 5 i was going to say that okay i was going to say that red and blue for he predictions i was going to say that red and blue have the same amount red and blue will have the same amount the same amount as the at the end yes okay we are going to stop here there is one more game that i want to teach you but we need to move on to what we are going to do in math today there is going to be another game where we are adding ounces each day ooh m kay so we will catch up tomorrow
if we add an ounce a day about how many ounces will we have tomorrow we will have about 3 we will have 3 ounces tomorrow okay so we will talk a little bit about that can i have my spinners please and when you back to your seats you are going to hold on to your whiteboards hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute i am going to see if you can kind of help me out on the number line and then we will put them away when we go to our partner game okay as you go back i need you to try not to bump the camera so you might want to go around that way
miss eunice can you throw this away for me thank you whoops thank you mister for letting me borrow that sweetie i am going to slide behind you thank you alright get to a place where you can see please we are going to spend a couple minutes here together
then we are going to play a partner game that i think i might pick the partners we will have to think about that for just a minute do we have everybody here today from both classes right we have nobody out okay so we have all 25 that means we will have to have one group of 3 jose is out okay so we do have an even group alright 1st think i do is i have i want to show you my 2 number lines i am actually going to put a 3rd one up there but we were kind of running out of room take a look at the 1st number line the one up top how is it spaced
by ones yes we have it kind of going by ones alright what we are going to do is we are going to take a look at a decimal number and think about where it would go on 3 different number lines so looking at the 1st number line i want you to draw you could just draw a segment but i want you to show me where do you think you would put this number between which 2 numbers on my number line 1st of all .
let me erase this real quick okay read that top number for me 3 and 73 hundredths 3.733 and 73 hundredths looking at we will call this why do not we just call this line number one looking at num line number one where would you put that number show me you do not have to draw the whole number line if you just want to kinda put the number that would be come before maybe draw the segment you do not have to draw 0 to 10
what 2 numbers would that come between 3 and 4 and who thinks they can come and show me where it would come so josiah will you do that for me come and show me where it would come what we are going to work on today is refining the ability to compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line do you want me to just put a dot or just put a dot put an arrow just kind of put it above it okay who agrees with that is that where you had yours
yes question if we were going to round this number look at what it is closest to what would it round to
it would round to 4 and i was telling my my science class that i will not be here on monday because of jury duty but this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is you will be thinking about rounding so i think it is kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today i know we have already kind of covered that a little bit but 3.73 is closer to 4 do you see that in my number line which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer is not it
alright now what i am going to do is i am going to erase this guy for just a minute and i am going to erase these numbers cause we are going to use this look at the 2nd number line we will call it number line 2 what is different about the 1st one that we just looked at david it was going by ones and this one is going by 5s okay so this one is kind of going by halves
that is why my last number is a what
it is a 5 alright so i want you to show me where would this number fall on this number line between which 2 numbers because now you are not just looking at the whole number you are having to look at parts of the decimal as well so show me what 2 numbers it would come in between
on this number line where would it fall on this one so now you are having to compare .73 with another number she put it between 3.5 and 4 who agrees with that alright we are going to actually make a different number line watch this one you ready i am going back up to the 1st one
you know what i might do is kind of stagger it i think that helped a little bit better look at this a little bit better what is different about this number line
yeah it is starting what is our f 0 you know what i forgot to put my last point alright so what are my 2 whole numbers that it is between
kay so these are numbers in between 3 and 4 show me on your whiteboard where you think 3 and 73 hundredths would fall josh why would you pick that because 3.7 and then you just need to go up 3 more and then you have it 3 what more 3 more tenths would that be tenths
hundredths yeah did you hear what josh said he says he kn he knew it was going to be bigger than 3.7 so he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this and i knew it was going to be less than 3.8 and he knew it was going to be less than this so that kind of narrowed it where that would fall in what did he have to look at did you hear what he said he said in this case he had to look at the hundredths place if i wanted to round 3.73 boy we could just play with this number all day could not we huh
you want to write it in word form
okay i will not do that yes 3.73 if i wanted to round this to the nearest whole number remember your whole number is the number to the left of the decimal show me what you would have we are just going to do a couple more things with this number the closest whole number
wait the closest whole number that means you are going to have .00.00 you are rounding it to the nearest whole number which is going to be this guy right here so is it going to be closer let us take a look at it is it closer to 3 point 3 or 44 what is it closest to if it is right here 4 okay can you round it to the closest 10th yes
is it closer to 3.7 or 3.8 where would it fall 3.7 it would be the same thing as 3.7 i mean 3.70 well it would not be the same thing but it would round well right it would round to 3.7 okay and could you round it to the closest 100th what would that look like that that that would not really make any difference it would still be 3.73.70
alright we are going to play a partner game kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day where we were using the decimal cards and you were and you were putting them in order
alright another fun partner game and let me show you how it works today you are going to have a recording sheet and you are going to have some more opportunities to compare numbers and to use your great than less than and equal to symbols kay goodness we have already been in class about 30 minutes alright what we are going to do is i am going to pass this around this is your recording sheet have we picked your partners yet no no not we have not picked partners yet
still should not see people playing on their whiteboards want to help me pass it out buddy
i had to get you one that was more challenging to be able to play pass it ou 0 i took em all that did not help i guess you can not pass that out
yes yes baby can we put up our whiteboards wait hold on and we will do the whiteboards when we are going to get partners and and in our re transitioning okay the 1st thing that you are going to do is i want you to take a look at your recording sheet you are going to play 5 rounds david can you slide up sweetie you are going to play 5 rounds of this game
and i want you to be thinking is this game going to be more luck or strategy when i luck well i had not told you the directions yet so listen for the directions the 1st thing you are going to do charlie can you come grab miss name a dice and it can be any any of the numbers it can be the one through 6
hm i forgot to get forgot to grab one for yourself where is the extra papers
huh
okay pass them to me okay extra extra read all about it thank you ben
extra extra those papers
okay does everybody have a recording sheet
alright no will you 0 my goodness my helpers you did not think to make things more efficient necessarily i make it more okay does everybody have a recording sheet for this game yes okay good deal alright listen up for just a moment the 1st thing you are going to do is you are going to roll the dice you and your partner
i roll a 2 i want you to roll it had not told you what to do ye with this yet okay i roll i got a 3 she got a 3 so let us do this you want to play class against miss courson for a couple of rounds yes alright sh you all got a 3 i got a 2 so who got less you right i have less so what i am going to do is how many circles are on my recording sheet
there are 5 all the way down my paper i am going to go less than less than less than all the way down alright so greater than y do not do it yet flip it over on the back yes go ahead and you guys put greater than 5 times 5 times greater than greater than greater than greater than huh 4 times i ran out of board here whoops
okay
so we do not do that we do not do that right here
she is the reason i am having you do this on the back is because i want you to use the front you are going to get with a partner in a minute and play this yeah right now i am just demonstrating the game and you are going to you are going to be one person and i am going to be the other person you all are going to try to beat me m kay alright so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who is going to go 1st rock paper scissors
okay i got 3 she got 3 are we going to do the highest number wins or the lowest number wins by the way who gets to go 1st i do not know highest number okay that works alright i got a 6 i am going to go 1st just simply because i got to teach you the game anyway right yes madam so this is what huh did you cheat watch alright let us listen
go ahead and write this all the way down your paper as well
yes because it is going to look like your recording sheet but it says 416 0 is it i am sorry i was thinking it was all yes okay just do just do the 1st one then just do the 2s
that would be hilarious but i did not the eraser dropped onto the ground 0 we will be okay okay you ready what we are going to do is we are going to go 1st we are going to go left to right my paper all has less thans you guys all have greater thans now it really does not matter who rolls the dice 1st just whoever you star with you need to stick with i am going to roll the dice 1st
and i am going to roll it 2 times alright i got a 2 and watch what i am doing when i roll the dice i am putting it in the order 00 that i roll it okay so a strategy game would be i would have to maybe decide where to put it
so this is more of a luck game knew it i told you okay alright now roll the other 2 okay class 6 yes do not say yes yet i got a 4 and a 4 okay this is how this games works is that number sentence true yes read it for me
0 and by the way you all should have been you guys should have been putting in those numbers too do that
0 just do it anyway let us watch what is going to happen what whose paper is this a true sentence on yours so guess who gets the point you aw okay so watch what we are going to do miss courson gets the point because that made an accurate and true number sentence 2 and 26 hundredths is less that is why you all were like yeah and i was like 0 no see i knew i would beat you already and 2 and 64
we are going to play okay listen
yes yes okay
what does the next one say watch now listen though shh if did you guys win that point or did i you okay but listen i do want you to write it the correct way cause practicing things incorrectly will help nobody so i want you to and if you take your paper home and your mom is like did your teacher tell you that was right it would be difficult to explain so i want you somewhere on your paper to write it the correct way
that works too m kay i want you to correct that okay alright the next one looks like this
actually will you pass it to a friend okay pass it to a boy okay so this is round 2 do you see what i mean by this is luck
cause if it was a strategy game i would be trying to make decisions about what place to put them in okay you ready garett we are going left to right 4 times okay 50 that is going to be challenging 44 okay so we need 011 what oops 22 yay we got a point is that a correct state or number sentence
no 4 and 54 hundredths is less than so who won that point
the greater than yes do not forget to correct it on your paper wait it is already correct on our paper 0 that is right i need to correct it duh okay so we get a point okay you got a point i got a point
okay next it is one alright
is it one okay so round 3 this is fun is not this a luck game it is a luck game it just depends 0
i am always number 13 i am sorry it is superstitious but i am always number 13 question can you kind of make predictions about who is going to get the point after the 1st couple of numbers rolled yeah cause you know the likelihood of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than you want a turn baby or you have a question i guess i want a turn okay you know what though i think i get to go fir i think actually it was my turn and then i will to you kay alright real easy to set up too
could you play this at home
instead of playing video games
yeah that is instead of playing video games but i do not get time to play video games anymore well i can not i am not allowed to play on weekend on weekdays but on weekends
okay who won that point
alright and what i want to show you is for friends who might need who may not if it is really close and you are not sure what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it if you need to have that picture so on your whiteboard listen to what i am sayin put your hand down for just a moment on your whiteboard i want you to draw a picture of that number sentence use your flats your longs and your units what would that look like here i will draw it on here
put your put your hand down you should be drawing on your whiteboard right now 0 on the whiteboard we are supposed to draw the 3rd one what i am demonstrating right now is i am showing how if you needed more support and if you were not sure especially if you had something like one.20 and one.02 i do not get this at all i do
watch me we have done this before
if you need to draw a picture if you were not sure do you have to do that no no i would not draw elaborate pictures draw your whole numbers your tenths and your hundredths okay we have been using these blocks all throughout our decimals unit and on the calendar this is the picture that matches if you do not need that do you have to do that no no
what i was recommending this for was if you got something like this and if it was tricky and if you needed the picture okay it would help with maybe something like this would that be less than or greater than
one.12 would be less than okay alright we are going to spend about 10 to 15 minutes playing this game yes buddy what if they are equal well if they are 0 if they are equal hm you would have to probably redo it or a tie breaker or a tie breaker you could do that too maybe you just want to decide before you start the game
okay when you go with your partner you are going to put your whiteboards away for me friends we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back okay so you got to make sure you get up the things you need to get up you could take this page home i am going to put a prompt on the board i am going to have you write in your math notebook and then we are going to share at the very end of class after this game i think i will let you pick your own partners
just do not bump the camera
honey is this your science experiment josh innappropriate
does everybody have a partner no kay i would like for ryan who are you working with you got to get started who are you working with
who were you working with okay joey is working with david and brandon are going to work together garett you all need to get started okay
yes
have you started working yet no okay let us go come on who are you with joey or brandon joey who is your partner okay get started how we doin ladies who is the less than person
wait a minute woah stop stop stop what di remember what did you roll did you roll .
okay we got to stop let us erase that hold on just a minute do not forget what is the 1st step of this game
boys boys the 1st step is you have to roll the dice and decide who writes the less than symbol all the way down their paper and then that does not change and who writes the greater than down their paper and that does not change m kay do that 1st figure out who is less than and greater than
okay so let us do that real quick roll the dice you only needed one dice ladies so which one are y okay that is fine okay so laura you are less than all the way down
okay now you are ready to start playing who is going to go 1st
laura is going to go 1st alright laura roll the dice so your 1st number you have got to do 4 numbers your 1st one is a 2 yours too alright and laura roll it again you are going to do the whole 1st .4 let us look at that okay so 2.24 is going to be less than something
2.24 is going to be greater than something that is going to be tricky who do you think is more than likely going to get this point based on the 1st 2 numbers
what would laura have to roll next
anything higher than a 2.25 or whatever alright let us see what she got
and 4 alright look at your number whose is correct laura is is because hers is actually less than 2 and 44 hundredths so who gets that and i do not care where you guys try to write it somewhere on the paper so that means hers it correct yours is not what are you going to have to do to make that right
yeah make sure you fix it or momma will think i am teaching you all the wrong things okay here we go okay 0 i like that a tally chart that works okay who is my greater than and and less than boys i am greater than okay and you are less than all the way down okay whose turn is it to roll the dice
okay you got to do all 4 of em all 4 of em going across did you write your 5 he is on the 2nd one he is on the 2nd point so you should have written a 5
okay and you have to copy the same thing
no no he is still rolling that whole point
okay is that how you all are playing it where you are both doing it .
you can we are going to do the prompt on the board in just a minute in our math notebook you went really fast huh you want to play a couple more points you can play a couple more points so is this my number he is going to finish rolling all the way across
keep going you are going to roll the next 2 you all are going to have the same numbers going across it is just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence the other one will not be write a 2
okay woah woah woah i did not see a one i just saw a 2
okay we did not see that so just make that number a 2
okay and a but i see a 4 so where would you get 3 from
okay okay and you got to write your 3 too okay so now look this is what these are the 4 numbers you have got in this turn which one is correct who got that point who got that point
so what do you have to do if he got that point that means yours is not right you have to correct it okay cause you can not go home with the wrong stuff on your paper right okay and now he will do the next 4 rolls for the 3rd point
0 you all did a championship round
boys and girls some of you guys are finishing a little bit quickly if you want to do a couple more rounds that is fine we do need to be wrapping it up in the next 5 minutes you have a math notebook prompt on the board so you need to go to your next available page what is wrong bud
0 who is doing okay so who is rolling for the 4th round did you all just get a tie score you all both got one.14 and one.14 no m kay let us do number 3 then i am going let me help you are not you glad i am here here grab the dice okay
okay hold on you got to erase it all the way across
i am going to let her do it though just cause you helped me before okay okay woah woah woah where would that 6 come from did you know that did you see that 6 okay did you write down the 1st 6 but which side do i write it on you are going to write it yours is going to look exactly like hers okay roll it again
m kay roll the next 2 numbers you roll it all the way across it is still your turn
and a one okay so she rolled a 6311 and one of these is correct the other one is not
why was hers correct
one and 63 hundredths is more than greater than one yeah so what you are going to do and now you will roll the next 4 numbers boom boom boom boom okay do not forget if yours was incorrect you have got to fix it on your paper so you do not take home the wrong information yes madam
yes who is your partner fatima fatima is okay alright boys and girls as you come to a stopping point hey you all boys and girls eyes on me please boys friends on the floor aria which number is larger this is your prompt on the board
3.7 or 3.653 point explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words you are going to do a quick write we are going to share these in about 8 minutes so a quick write means you are sitting down you are getting it done you may take this game home hurry put my clipboards away please
put my dice away luke why do not you walk around and be the helper okay today is the 2nd it is february 2nd
madison do you mind walking around pushing in chairs so we will be ready after lunch colby walk on make sure we have all the dice put back in the container
madison is already started luke were you pushing in chairs for me sweetie
over here i am also going to pass out your homework for tonight it is a review of what we have done it is a review of equivalent decimals
want to help me pass these out sweetie quick write i already see eunice she has her math notebook out which number is larger 3.7 or 3.65 explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words and also symbols
and i will write your homework on the board will you p pass this down to brandon and audrey please the game sheet that you guys had today you could take that home with you charlie you should be in your seat now and i think someone might be missing their math notebook because it has been up here on the table
i think that is that is colby is i think it is
not sure what that other notebook is but keep it in your math notebook does everybody have a homework for tonight miss courson i do not get it which number is larger 3 and 7 tenths or 3 and 65 hundredths explain your thinking using pictures numbers and words got about 4 more minutes keep writing
pw i put ps nintey 6 because you see they have named it differently this comes from a problem solving book yeah that is why it says ps 96 not pw normally we put pw 960 it says ps on here too it says ps on the paper that is why i just did not want to confuse you by putting pw
homework yes i like how i see kashish writ drawing some pictures maybe similar to what we did back before the game keep writing or write in your agenda book who has one to share even if it is just part madison
the way i know 3.7 is greater than 3.65 is because if you added 0 to 770 is greater than 65 yes that is correct who else has one audrey 3.7 is farther on the number line so it is larger it is farther on the number line if we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class it would be down a tad would not it jasmine
okay david .
keep working because it is far it is farther in the lumber in the number line and it is also no it is larger it the 7 is maybe 700 yeah look at he looked at his tenths place did you hear what he just said he compared the tenths place and he knew that 7 was greater than what 6 yeah brandon what would you get
3 and 7 tenths is larger than 3 and 65 hundredths i know this because 10 times 10 is 100 so 7 times 10 is 70 and 70 is greater than 65 okay josh i think 3 3.7 is bigger becau because it is the same thing as 3 3.70 okay
it is correct it is correct just different ways of saying 3 and 7th tenths is just another way of saying 3 and 70 hundredths that is why i think 3 and 7 tenths is greater than 3 and 65 hundredths did anyone draw a picture hole up if you drew pictures using x is or a 100s chart or dots that is kind of a lot you would have had to draw like 710s or 7 yeah
did you do an equation tell me what is your equat you did an equation with pictures i did okay i did take one minute and share to the person to the right or to the left or across from you but turn to your elbow partner let them see your math thinking make sure you have your homework packed up tomorrow listen guys for just a 2nd daily grade on this skill tomorrow cause i think we are good with it kay
