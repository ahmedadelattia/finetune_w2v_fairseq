yeah yeah the sooner we get math done the sooner we get through everything else the more chance that free time starts at 2.35
you might by that time free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45 no no that that is good that means you get extra free time 0 see it means you get extra free time that is a good thing all right shhh is it looking at you right now okay yes the camera is on we are going to try to pretend it is not here please counting down from 5 4 3 2 you shush
you shush too i am going to pick 5 prize winners today and they are going to get to pick from the prize box and the 1st person i pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box so it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can all right 20 seconds right as many yes as many tickets raise your hand when you have something to say yes jamari did not i get picked out yes you can pick later for that too did i get picked out
no thomas and jamari okay so let us get started so that we can get to work on all right somebody want to read our objective for today i do josea what is our objective for today students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly polygon okay stop there students will be able to determine what does determine mean again someone raise their hand raise their hand what does determine mean again
jamari to do okay something else to learn maybe to to learn okay answer no and you need to not call out what does det lala determine mean to know the word of what it is to figure it out right
to decide to figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon right anyone know what a polygon is do you know hold on to it though do not tell us yet do you know all right write it down on piece of paper for me
because i want to know that you knew and you will get extra points for that you know where they are you can write it down now what we are going to start with is i want you to see is that our homework ms jensen this is not your homework is not that homework okay i know this is listen listen
i know what a polygon looks like this is one minute off of free time shut up shut up man i i understand that it is different having a video camera in here but it is staring right at me you know what miguel then move your seat
can i switch with somebody then
why there you go can i just face go now again guys this is a video camera no big deal okay pretend it is not here let us have our normal math lesson okay and ms you know what is funny what we usually do not act like that since when we are doing math when the camera is not here
exactly no well well that is what i am saying this is not how we normally act during math so let us try to make it normal pretend it is not even here okay okay now we are going to talk about no okay all the talking guys come on it is a camera it is not
i will wait no one is even talking you know what guys i will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether if somebody is talking and is not supposed to i will take care of that
no is it the 11th that is you today is 11th do not worry about putting the date on i just want you to look at this for a 2nd 0 this did not get turned on please do not whistle so sorry but there is a camera okay and again camera should not make any difference done
no does not have to be green close to never mind
i said i am saying hello okay and of course we have technical difficulties what if we press that button i do not know which way is it on jamari when it has the orange or when it does not when it has the green when it has the green on that little circle thing okay when there is like a light coming right here yeah okay sit sit sit sit it is red okay so let us wait and see if it comes on or not
okay freeze it is coming on okay hit the 1st 2 lights please no it is not yes it is how do you know okay you guys are right again wait a 2nd yeah just 2 just half no the other half no no no flip them
there that is what i want thank you no so boring you know what okay sorry sorry you are not going to be famous okay all right until i get this on let us take a look at the paper in front of you we have polygons
polygons they are shapes it is the corner i did not ask about the corners i want you to look at the paper looking at the paper okay the top 3 shapes they are telling us that those are polygons okay and the bottom 3 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so what i want you to do while i get this fixed is i want you to look and try to figure out do not say it out loud think in your head what is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons in your head only that is not a polygon no in your head only i am not going to answer that question right now guys circle it that is not a polygon no i am right now i can not spell right now
i know ms jensen maybe the plug is not working the kind of plug 0 you know what 0 wait the thing is not on xavier you get 10000 points that might be the problem that is not what
hey he did not do that because he saw the plug unplugged all right everybody stand up mommy everybody stand up ms jensen he is talking about my mom jumping jacks 15 of them let us go ms jensen he is talking about my mom i will take care of it
do not worry about it okay now everybody look at the camera make a funny face stay right here we are in your seat okay now sit down okay okay come on now sit down now we need to forget that it is even there
okay now i will wait
yeah i do okay maybe the battery maybe it is the plug up up there hold on a 2nd yes can we pause this
only because i am having major technical difficulties with my board and so the kids are all silly anyway we could turn it back on in a 2nd i just okay let us fix so someone let us start and somebody read our content objective again me again students can students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon polygon or not a polygon
okay so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon okay and we just said that we that determine means to figure out or decide so we are going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or is not a polygon okay now someone read the language objective xavier students 0 wait students will be able to define a polygon
students will be able to define a polygon okay so not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or is not a polygon but before you can do that you have to know what a polygon is right i have heard of it before you have heard of it before anybody else heard of it before nope no okay well we are going to talk about them today the paper in front of you and up here has 3 shapes that they are telling us are polygons okay and the bottom 5 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
so the 1st thing i want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons what might be the same about them i am not going to ask you to share it yet i do not want you to share it yet but i want you to think about it because i am going to give you another sheet in a minute and you are going to work with a partner next to you
to try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons okay so do you understand what i said richard yeah repeat what i said for me please repeat what i said you are going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons okay and you are going to work with a partner to do so
so take a look at these again and notice what they have in common those top 3 notice what they have in common not going to take comments i want to see how you guys do working this out on your own with your partner and and the bottom ones you are going to figure out why are they not polygons what is different from the ones on top okay
so i am going to have richard nathan and jamari work together as a trio i will take care of you in a 2nd xavier xavier you are going to work with josea and what you are going to do is if you think this shape is a polygon you are going to write a p on it if you think this shape is not a polygon you are going to write an n on it for not okay so you are determining if it is a polygon or not
can i do this one too nope because that already tells you they already tell you there that is your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon isaiah and justin together please miguel and thomas together please marvin and isaiah together please you know what we work with partners as we are assigned in this class and you get rewarded when you work with no he is not you are not going to start trouble are you what am i doing you are working with marvin
okay umm look at me marvin work with isaiah please okay you know what isaiah can you bring your seat over here and work with no you are working by yourself if you do not work with him let us go isaiah bring a chair over here thomas and miguel isaiah is going to work with you too okay
now did you hear what i said before you came back in did you hear what i said hey do you know what you are doing what is the matter what is the matter can you work with thomas at least or you do not want to work with thomas ms jensen could i take a 5 minutes break what is going on in here today
isaiah bring your desk next to thomas mister gomez could you work with thomas and isaiah please
x c a star this is not one 2 so do we cross it out nope you write p if it is a polygon you write n if it is not a polygon all right n well did you talk to your partner did you decide what makes a polygon and what does not yeah all right if it is a polygon are you guys talking to each other what makes a polygon what does not make a polygon
i think a polygon is fully shaped fully shaped okay this is not a polygon okay well talk to your partners about that tell them i do not want you to just write something down i want you to talk about it
thomas you asked for another pencil right no you did not you asked for a break you did not ask for a pencil you asked for a break right no i did not hear you thomas so n if it is not a polygon p if it is now do we agree yeah
with nathan too yeah that every one of them is the same he is not even done how could it be the same you guys need to talk to him ms jensen i am done ms jensen i am done all right hold on to it hold on to it we are going to do a little activity with this in a 2nd
no it does not matter but does look it like it ms jensen we do not know what polygons are yes right and we have not done the definition so that is okay if you do not get it correct but i want you to look and see if you can think of something that these shapes here have in common that these shapes do not have and then find the ones that have the same things in common on your sheet okay these 2
well there you go so those would be polygons ms jensen yes i got my name so small okay that is fine
make sure you and xavier have the same answers and i am going to tell you in a minute no worries if it is polygon you put the one
okay that is a polygon i am asking you it is not there no it does not that is just that is cool right it says polygon and then it says not a polygon i am sorry if i confused you it means we are going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that are not that is so easy that is my name right here okay to your seat i do not get it they are the same thing
no no no no no no no no okay i am sorry ignore what is up here so far this has nothing to do with whether it is a polygon or not
i know and that is my bad guys that is my bad ignore what is up here okay i was getting ready for our next step xavier your seat is over here please be in it xavier not in 5 minutes right now but they are doing them wrong xavier listen to me
you know what it is not your business to tell them that they are wrong sit down josea you 2 need to stay in your seats all right eyes up here eyes up here did some of us i will wait no point of arguing
okay now the reason are you guys done isaiah and justin have you finished no okay hurry up and finish you got 30 more seconds or actually bring it back to your seats where you were that is fine you can finish it after i want to talk about the next step so i confused some of you
i confused some of you and rightfully so because what i did was i drew 2 circles on the board and i put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other but what this means is we are going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet and the ones that are a polygon we are going to put inside this circle and the ones that are not a polygon we are going to put inside that circle so i am not telling you this is a polygon this is not a polygon so that is why you were confused
and it is good to be confused it means you were paying attention okay means you were paying attention no it does not yes it does i will wait 3 2 before it comes up 3 times one xavier xavier yeah please put that down
now what do you want to tell me okay you can tell me in a 2nd then because i am going to give this marker out for a 2nd and i am going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that is on your paper and put it in the right circle so for example you could choose number one and if you think it is a polygon draw it in the polygon circle if you think it is not a polygon draw it in the not a polygon circle
the one thing i am going to say is let us draw them about this size so that we have enough room okay all right we do not want them real giant because we need enough room we want them big enough so everyone can see them you can tell me in 12nd so miguel not right this 2nd who would like to put a polygon or not a polygon up there yes is this it or this not i want to you had a chance
what do you need
do not worry okay is that big yeah that is a perfect size i do not think i read it right now the one thing i am going to ask is make sure because i know the figure that he is drawing is like this right it comes down all the way let us make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that
so jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon thank you okay so jamari says this is a polygon okay if you disagree with him when it is your turn you can put a question mark inside his polygon
if you say nah that is not a polygon that is not a polygon then you could come up i am not saying it is wrong okay but you could come up and you could put a question mark inside okay and that can be your turn
you can do the next one richard thank you for your enthusiasm you know what enthusiasm means no your excitement all right so richard draw us a polygon or not a polygon i am not even doing nothing do you know what you are yes i know josea you have had how many good days in a row like the whole week almost right
do you want to really blow it now no no so make some good choices for me okay yes yes can i go next possibly hold on all right so richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite right it is open and it has a line that goes further down he says that is not a polygon all right isaiah
we will see you are going to write with a pencil go ahead draw me one that is either a polygon or not a polygon move your desk over a little bit please a bit more than that he will get a chance everybody is going to get a chance
okay good stay there you can bring your paper with you if you are afraid you are going to forget what it looks like
that is all right uhh while he is doing that does anyone have a polygon they would like to put up i would josea you had a chance right but everybody is going to get a chance 1st what is that a diamond no or here turn this over it is a square i need you looking at this
it this a square or is it not no we will talk about it we will talk about it we will talk about it we are not going to argue over what a shape is or is not right now that is perfect and they are not going to look exactly like they look in the picture what you can do umm where is that marker please wait why did you give him the marker
what number was yours josea mine yep what do you mean number look at your sheet what number is it 9 what number is yours jamari mine is one we will put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape what number was yours what number was this it was 2 no that one is 2 that one is 2 okay
that way we are all talking about the same shape okay isaiah would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon in your opinion or one that is not a polygon not okay go ahead not is over here do i have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon i know hand up only
all right justin put the number up there too okay so you are saying that is a polygon okay what number is it
number 8 we are discussing the paper what number is that we are discussing it okay okay this one i got one hold on do you have one that is not a polygon i do
that is not a polygon i got one right yeah no i do not know which one have not you done one already let us let everyone have a chance 1st do you have one that is not a polygon ms jensen hold on does anybody else wants wants a turn that has not had a turn i do i do i do i do you just did one right nathan you want a turn do you have one that is not a polygon
uhh no do you have one that is a polygon okay can i do it yeah thank you
not a polygon please yeah it belongs in there please
no he messed up he did something wrong he has got the extra okay well copy it right off the paper he has the paper in front of him he can fix it that looks like a state or something on the map it looks nothing like mpas where does it come out
okay what number is that you forgot to write the number you are not showing no no no because all right let us take a look at
please do not crinkle that all right let us take a look up here i know there is some that we have not gotten up there but i want to see if we can come up with some rules that we think makes a polygon a polygon or makes a polygon or makes something not a polygon i am going to wait till everyone is sitting though and ready ms jensen you need to sit down okay
now yes all right go put it up quick the the marker is already up there does anybody have a question i do about someone is up there thatt hey think ah i do not agree i do not agree i either think this is a polygon or i think it is not a polygon i think they got it mixed up
go put a question mark jamari in one that you think 3 of them okay go put the question marks in them put that away now why because it is not time to draw it is time to do math yes it is
why you know the rules richard
hold on do you have more that go up there or do you have a question about one all right the way we are going to start xavier huh we are we are discussing if the right but right now i need you up here please okay thank you
i appreciate that you are talking about math but right now we are going to have a whole group discussion about math okay well isaiah is finishing up up there i want your 1st thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not i want your 1st thoughts about polygons okay
is there something that you notice about those 1st 3 polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have excuse me yes that the ones the 31s on the top are like regular shapes like square a star
so you are saying that they are regular shapes okay all right well are not these regular shapes here too though yeah okay anybody have anything else that when they 1st look at these they think hey i know what these polygons might have in common i know one what is that richard
what they have to be together they have to be together so richard is saying they have to be together sure what do you mean by together okay so what richard is saying is that this is not together okay
whereas this is together all of the line segments meet okay now richard when we talk about that in math when we talk about a shape like this that does not meet and a shape like this that does meet we are talking about a closed shape or an open shape
okay now a closed shape all the line segments and it is hard sometimes with this of course it is not going to even look like that but it is difficult sometimes with the pen but miguel i can take care of it myself thank you
now an open shape could look something like this right do we see the difference this part of it is left open this it is all closed all the line segments meet each other okay so we could say that polygons richard is theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes richard
are they open or closed closed closed i do not know why that is coming out red but so you know what not the time to talk about field trip right now and crayons go away no it is not time to color we are looking for characteristics of polygons
in math when we are talking about characteristics we are talking about attributes if i was talking about jamari one of the characteristics i could use to describe him is that he is kind and he is gentle all right he is a good friend those are characteristics that would describe jamari right what we are doing now is we are coming up with characteristics that describe polygons okay
another word for characteristics is attributes so what attributes do polygons have okay how would we describe polygons i could describe jamari as tall kind gentle right how would i describe a polygon one way we are thinking to describe a polygon is that it is a closed wait a 2nd 12nd that it is closed okay that it is a closed figure okay
and we know that that means all the the sides are even okay this needs to be recalibrated but closed i did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot i did not give up i am just going to recalibrate it after math is over
then we will be able to do it now so do you see how all 4 sides meet yeah that makes it a closed figure so a polygon is a closed figure can you give me something else that is an attribute you think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons miguel male the sides have to meet the sides have to meet miguel says
what do you mean by that everything meets like in the corner ms jensen sides meet at corners ms jensen
okay ms jensen okay saying that excuse me wait no i am talking to miguel right now saying sides meet at corners miguel is different from lines of symmetry okay saying that sides meet at corners here we have sides meeting at corners right here we have sides meeting at corners one corner 2345 corners right
okay but that is different from lines of symmetry on 1st look there would not be any lines of symmetry to this figure okay so that is okay it is good thinking and this is actually you are on the right track here okay but i do not want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it does not really have to do with that okay yes sides meet at corners okay the lines are even so all the lines are even
let us look at not all but some yeah okay so if we are not saying all and we are saying some do you think it has to mean are any of the lines do the shape are like even like this this is a polygon right this has the same height of this and then this .
okay so you are showing me so you are showing me on this paper here you are saying that this one has equal sides right yeah okay but here is my question does this one have equal sides no but they are telling us this is a polygon so this might have equal sides but it does not seem like you have to have equal sides does it no
so that is something that some polygons might have but we are looking for things that all polygons are going to have okay good thinking though nathan uhh pointy they all have points okay so you are saying it begins with an a no problem you are saying she has been up for a minute because rocky needed the bathroom but she wants me to brush her hair
do you have our spray right up there okay so these polygons here umm what was the question repeat repeat what you said nathan 0 they all have points okay what do we call this when we are talking about math what do the corners corners okay we are getting some great math vocabulary words here
sides corners does anyone know and i used this word before this might be a new one for you what it is called when we have a straight line the part of a straight line what we call that line segment line segment all right
so we can say about polygons that they have sides right that are made of what line segments all the polygons have lines right which are straight okay that makes a line right
so they all have line segments so sides are line segments now let us get back to what nathan said he said that they have corners okay we said that the sides meet at corners right so we know that they have sides that are line segments that they meet at the corners okay
anyone know the math term for when 2 line segments meet like that to form an angle what we call it right angle vertical they are called vertices okay where 2 line segments meet and make angle are called vertices okay running out of room
fit that s in here you know miguel i am glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes lie 0 no i am telling you the truth now now you have to walk all the way over there that is okay that is okay i can handle it now so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure the sides meet at corners
okay and that the sides are line segments okay that is a good list that is a very good list can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that 1st page here sorry have that in common can we agree that they have corners yes vertices
that they are line segments that meet at those corners
wait and that they are all closed figures yes all right let us look at our not jamari is very excited that he was right now let us hold on now not polygons let us think of our list all right closed figure
they are always open open figure they are always open no no corners no corners meet okay so let us look at this if we have as our 3 characteristics i am going to write inside of this okay because this is polygons we have closed line segments vertices and vertices
and i am abbreviating okay we know it means that they all have line segments as their sides that those line segments meet i got one in the corners which are vertices and that it is a closed shape hold on no hold on i want to show you something with this okay tell me let us look at this is this a closed figure no no because we have what
what this big line segment here right that is extending out from this vertice okay so we know this is not a polygon what is wrong with this now this is closed it has a line segment this vertice but not really right because what cut in half but not really because what are these line segments no
is this a line segment no yeah no a line segment is straight okay a line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this this is what this is if it is not straight it is circle not a circle oval it is not an oval but what is the what is the .
the line here is not straight so it is not a line segment it is curved right so we do not have line segments there so we know this is not a polygon what about this it is crooked it is crooked it is crooked it is not that it is crooked because this is a straight line one side is bigger than the other this is a straight line one is bigger than the other okay let us go back to let us go okay no hold on
i want to go back to our 3 attributes that we came up with so far closed line segments and vertices does it have corners where it meets yes okay so it has that does it have line segments yes is it a closed figure not really no no in order to be closed well .
yes let me let me take that back because we missed and this is my bad we missed part of line segments the thing about polygons my fault is that the thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices but they do not cross they never cross
okay so they never cross that is the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon okay those line segments never cross so what is the problem with this one it crosses it crosses that is the problem with this one is that it crosses okay so that is not a polygon what is the problem with the 4th one down there on the bottom
it is not closed it is not closed what is the problem here it is 2 shapes right it is not one shape right now is this shape if we took this triangle away is that a polygon if we took this square away is that a polygon yes but put them together they are not polygons right okay great job great job let us go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see
let us take a look at what we put up here is this a polygon yes yep consensus is this a polygon yes yes is this a polygon yes is this a polygon yes no no that is curved thank you it is curved they are not line segments right wait so no no we already did that one over there right no what about this
no okay is it closed yes does it have straight lines that do not cross does it have straight lines that do not cross yeah does the do they meet at vertices do they all meet at corners yeah is it a polygon no yeah is it a polygon no why not tell me why not prove it that it is not it is because i look kind of crooked it no these are in order you are getting confused
in order for a line to be straight it does not mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way it can be any way it just can not be curved okay so xavier is this closed yes is are they line segments that do not cross yes are they do they have vertices yeah is it a polygon yes yes let us go to let us go to not a polygon
is this not a polygon yeah correct how about this one why is it not a polygon it is a polygon because it has straight lines it has straight lines what else and it has line segments okay it has line segments that do not cross it has corners and it is closed this is a polygon so who put the question mark up here jamari jamari did you
you were right jamari that is well i should not put a correct mark because this is a polygon okay so you were right to question it how about this one number 10 here isaiah you put this one up right not a polygon tell me you think it is not a polygon tell me why you think it is not a polygon isaiah because it does not have the the even sides it is curved yeah it is curved okay so you were right on this how about this here
that is right this is not a polygon right it is not a polygon what is wrong with this one that has crooked like the lines okay take crooked take crooked out of your vocabulary right there is no corner here right so this is right you were right it is not a polygon okay number 12 that is not a polygon i want to take a look at that i did number 12 okay you did number 12
why is it not a polygon because it it is not even what do you mean it is not even one of the sides is shorter than the other side did we say that the sides have to be equal over here no we have we said that the sides have to be line segments that do not cross are there any line segments that cross in that yeah where no no no no is it a closed figure or an open figure i was right on that one too closed yes you were
is it a closed figure or an open figure closed do they meet at corners do the line segments meet at corners is this a polygon yes this is a polygon you know what it is okay when we were i want you to remember that when we were doing this we did not even know the definition of a polygon okay we did not even know so let me ask you a question let us go
what have we been talking about so far this week in math who can give me a couple of ideas of things we have discussed ben graphs okay we have been talking about graphs what kind of graphs have we explored this week chucky line graphs okay we have talked about line graphs celeste bar graphs bar graphs that has been most of our focus this week at a couple of other times we talked about some other things matthias pie graphs okay we have kind of talked about pie graphs noah double line graphs we talked about double line graphs
last one celeste
okay good we used tally marks to help us create those charts i like the fact that you remember that alright judging by what i have on the board what type of graph do you think we are going to be talking about today let us get some help from marcy
good we are going to be talking about a pie graph does anybody know another name for the pie graph anna circle graph circle graph why do you think we call it that max why do you think max why do you think we call it that because it is a circle that represents the amount of the sets okay good mainly because it is a circle okay so we have our circle graph it is on the board
what are some things you notice just by looking at it celeste give me one thing that you notice that half of it is colored blue good all of this side half of this is colored blue what is this graph about jaydon what do you think this graph is showing us it is books in the jaydon books books books what in the library books that are in the library so it is showing us these are all the books that are in the library
and it is showing us what parts are what different types of books so it is showing us 4 different types of books what is one type of book that it is showing us sandra non fiction okay it is showing us non fiction books chase fiction number one it is also showing us fiction books
okay should i put them here she is not in here right now thank you chase what other type of graph i mean i am sorry what other types of books is it showing us we got fiction non fiction history historical fiction good those are books that are historical tru i am sorry not true but they are based on things that still happened in history we are missing one other type stephanie what other type of book is up here
emily help us out we got historical fiction non fiction fiction and biographies biographies good i like the fact that emily is answering when i call on her alright so we have got 4 different things that are being shown here what is the book that we have the most of in the library you can probably tell this pretty quickly by looking at the graph what is the book that we have the most of in the library lisa
what doe we have the most of in the library fiction good how can you tell that so easily noah because it is it is half and all the others are not bigger than half good i like he said this is half the other is not as big as half but we can tell most of it is colored blue by looking at this graph pretty simply do we have any numbers up here yet no no but we can still tell andrew what do we have the least amount of green
historical fiction this green section here excellent job very good okay today we are going to work on making our own circle graph let me tell you how we are going to do this the 1st thing that we are going to do you are going to get a chart that looks like this and you are going to get an imaginary sorry guys it is imaginary
an imaginary $100 it has to be imaginary because i am not the richest person in the world and i do not have a $100 to give you if if i did i would alright so you have a decision to make you have to decide how you are going to spend your $100
if you had a budget of $100 for the month and you had to decide where you were going to spend this money you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it i am going to show you how i might spend it okay you are going to have some different categories that you can spend it in so you have you have some important choices to make 1st choice you have to decide how much money you are going to spend on food for the month what are some things that you might spend money on for food
just go ahead and give me a couple of quick examples alexis cakes i am going to call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands i appreciate that alexis go ahead food yeah what types of food might you buy bread okay you might buy bread celeste
milk olive garden okay you might treat yourself to olive garden martina junk food okay you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food good alright next category brussels sprouts next category just kidding we are going to talk about clothing now you get to decide if you we are going to wait you are going to decide how you are going to spend if how much money you want to spend on clothes
you might decide that you only want to spend $10 on clothes you might decide that you want you saw this jacket the other day and you really want to buy it and it is $70 you might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing we are also going to take a look at games what are some things .
raise your hand if you can tell me 11 type of game or one game example that you might be interested in
okay alexis grand theft auto okay naya
okay good hands down alright you are .
putting our hands down does not mean we shout out what answer we were going to give 0 man you have also got movies if you are interested in either one of 2 things here hands down there is 2 different types of movies that i am thinking here one is if you wanted to go to the movies the 2nd one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the dvd of it so you have a couple different things to think about there then finally we have got toys
if there is a certain type of toy 0 i left one off sorry books you c .
yeah you get to decide which area you are going to spend how much money so for example i am going to choose 3 different categories i am going to show you what i would do for my chart you are going to get to do this in just a moment but i am going to show you how i might decide to spend my money so at this point our pencils are still down our eyes are still up here i appreciate that entire 2nd row excellent job alright so expenses
i am going to decide that i am going to spend money on clothes and i am only going to choose 3 things you have to choose at least 3 categories but you can choose more if you want to i am also going to choose books and i am also going to choose fl food for my categories now the .
the 1st thing that i am going to do i am going to decide how much money i am going to spend on each area now how much money did i say that i had in all ben a 100 a 100 bucks alright i have a $100 in all to spend so i have to make sure that my total is going to equal $100 okay i can not spend just $50 total i have to make sure the whole thing is going to be $100 so for example gentlemen
i am going to spend i am going to go with $30 on clothes no let me go $40 on clothes
i am going to go with $40 on clothes i am going to go with $30 on books and i am going to go with .
$30 on food say what so the next thing naya brought up a good point it ha yes it has to equal a $100 so 40 and let me double check 40 and 30 is 7070 and 30 is 100 so i am good i do not have to use round numbers you could do $12 or $9 it is up to you as long as your total for your categories equals $100 next i am going to go to the following category what is your question
then do not be next category amounts spent out of $100 if you have to start it like that it is not going to be good okay okay dollars spent out of $100 alright so i am going to write a fraction this amount would be what how much out of 100 did i spend on clothes
i 40 how much $4040 out of 100 so my fraction is going to be 40 over 100 celeste help me out here books what would my fraction be for books celeste 30 out of a 100 excellent $30 out of $100 and the last one let me get some help from sandra how much am i spending on food as a fraction 30 over a 130 out of 130 over 100
now when we have talked about percentages all year long what did we say was always true about percentages they always had to be what max based out of a 100 based out of 100 well guess what we are lucky today with our fractions these are all out of 100 so this is going to be pretty easy i hope for us to convert to percentages jaydon what percentage of my money am i spending on clothes 4040% what percentage of my money am i spending on books daniel 30
30% and what percentage of my allowance or my budget am i spending on food matthias 30% 30% excellent job now after we have gotten our percentages i am going to have an opportunity to make my own circle graph now probably the hardest part about a circle graph is splitting it into the right number of sections
one of the papers that i have given you already has it you do not have to worry about it i am going to show it to you up here alright the circle graph that i am going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute not right now the circle graph that you are going to get already has 100 spots marked okay
so all i am going to do on my circle graph i have a 100 marks i need to color in 40 of those as clothes so let me give you kind of an idea of what you are going to do here i am just going to kind of i am going to start here for my clothing chucky eyes up here please eyes up here i am going to start here so 12345678910
did you just notice something about where that line is naya each like triangle equals 10 good each one of these big triangles is 10 but if i needed to do like 12 could i stop there yeah i can stop there and just draw a line but i did not do 12 so i am going to go 10203040 so .
this section is going to be 40% of my circle now just like on the graph we were looking at earlier this needs to be colored one color next i have books what should i probably do before i move on to books count it
before i move on to books what should i do emily label it ah and then great label it cause here is what is going to happen i am going to do books next and i am going to forget which one was clothes so i am just going to label this as clothes for right now and i can do one of 2 things i could either put $40 or i would put 40% and since it is a pie graph i think we should put 40% as our amount i am sorry you could put dollars that is showing the amount
but because we are doing a circle graph i think it is usually better to use percentages okay books i am going to do the same thing except that i am going to go 102030 so this section would be books books and what percentage would that be stephanie 3030% excellent job now am i going to color these the same color no no we are going to make sure that we have 2 different colors and then .
well 3 or 4 different colors depending on how many categories you are choosing then my last section would be food and i am going to label this as food and that would also be 30% there is one other thing that i want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute any ideas on what that might be what is one thing .
with my circle graph that i do not have right now celeste a title ah a title and i am not going to write it cause i would end up writing way up there on the wall but i would put my title what is a ti and of course you can be more creative with your title that i am probably going to be an example of a title i might have how i would spend my $100 can we change it out for the dollar sign yeah you could well you want to give us an idea .
the purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about if i titled it $100 it is a cute name like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody is interest but people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about chucky my budget okay my budget how i would spend my $100 naya my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot celeste
i am just trying to double check do we have to use all of them okay okay excellent question you do not have to use all of these categories you have to choose at least 3 if you want to do every category you can but if you would rather ju let us say you know that you want to buy one book and that is only going to be $5 include it do $5 on a book okay but you have to choose at least 3 categories to purchase things in
chase do we have to put money in the categories cause i got clothes movies and food and i put 90 in clothes and 10 in food okay that is up to you we have not actually started yet i am going to put one other category up here and this is just to give you another option we are going to do a savings category if you would like to put some money aside to save for later you can always put it in the savings any other questions before we start today naya
like yours do we have to do that key ah excellent question naya asked a good question that i did not go over i love that do you need to do a key i would say yes it is going to be more clear if you have a key when you look at a graph in a book does it usually give you a key yeah excellent so when you have a graph you should pretty much always plan on including a a key any other questions before you get started all right before you flip your papers over and get started .
i do not mind if you are in a whisper but you need to be at your seats working on your graph if you do finish early if you finish before we are ready to stop i want you to turn your paper over and write 5 questions that can be answered from your graph if you do not have if you do not have colored pencils markers or crayons please borrow them from somebody around you not from somebody across the room
okay andrew
we are going wait and go to success maker about 1130 okay naya
you probably will not have time but we will see if you if you finish with all of it and your 5 questions raise your hand and let me know we will figure something out martinez why are you spending like $30 on food when i usually buy like cereal milk or bread i plan on treating myself to olive garden with naya so i figured it might cost me a little bit more
no goodness no alright any other questions before we start it is so cute cause any other questions before we start alright you may begin do we just put a circle with percent say that one more time
yeah that is fine right exactly you would not necessarily have to put what the name of it was it is optional see you at olive garden tomorrow
there you go some good sushi i am putting 90 in clothes cause i like clothes that is fine but you have to choose .
how many categories do you have to choose 3 okay choosing a category and putting in a 0 do you think that counts yes no
you do not you do not have to put a lot but you do need to have a 3rd category that has something in it i want to put 5
i want to color that one so hm i want to color this okay
no it has got to be somebody around you nope somebody close to you marcy is not close enough $40
huh
no borrow from somebody borrow from somebody
$20 okay okay
alright what do we got so far add them up for me 10 104078 9100 excellent ooh i have $34 left
i got $0 left excellent you can go ahead and start coloring if you are ready hm what there you go emily is going to help you out there i am done alright cool so let us add them up and make sure 30 50 so do your pie graph 40 .
so 90 so 5090 and hey does not this picture look a little bit like pacman attacking pacman harper you are ready no you are fine i am i am just visually looking at what you are doing to make sure we are on the right math let me get the types 1st perfect you may start coloring i can put ¢24 into movies right how many movies you want yes
yep that works you are exactly right 4627 and you are going to give us that tough math let us see 406666 and 24 would be ooh wait hold on let us see 46 what is this supposed to be it is someone else we could do with the circle
7 and 24 double check it i think we are about 3 off does this have to be neat or can i leave it like that i would like for it to be neat i would like to always see your best work which is usually your neatest work
i can not find my mistake what mistake i did the wrong chart that is supposed to be this is supposed to be at 30% i do not have nothing else that is 20% well i will put something at 20% no that was my games 0 i can change this yeah i would change something to make it so yeah okay i think that would work
good idea
he said i eat nasty food that is wrong he is jealous cause he does not know high quality food what w we understand martinez alright 6075 perfect all right you have got all your percents in you are ready to get started what are we doing he changed the line no
do something else that is we can not do that you are going to make a mess all over the place does that one work that will work
let us see chucky
i i am going to color the happy face okay you can also decorate around the edges yay that would be marvelous i like them both so no which is the .
if you are happy if you are happy me and my brother eat it if i am in a happy mood yeah if i am in a happy mood i am going to go with chili lobster awesome miss name can you take me to olive garden can i take you to olive garden yeah like right now i wish i could that would be nice
i do not like olive garden alright now can i call time out for a 2nd are these are going to be the same blue alright that is going to throw me off let me go get you another one okay cause i messed up would that be okay okay it is next to the sushi spot yeah 0 yeah
thank you you are welcome what you are welcome alright how are we doing bad actually 40102030 beautiful i am coming there next anna alright so you got you have clothes is here
let us see so 10203045 perfect books are where are books okay books are 5 food is 20 movies are where 10 and games are 10 why did we end up with .
an open spot alright let me see you pencil i am not seeing it okay so from here 10203045 okay all of that is clothes right yeah okay and then we have got books books
let us do books here for this 5 then we have food which is 20 up to there so we have from here to here so far right so we have 102030 and you have 30 left that is perfect okay so games is 20 ah i see the games was only at 15 that is why we were missing that 5
alright if we put books here games is how much 2020 so do games from here to here and then movies in there that will work out that is where that extra 5 that is where we were missing it from that makes sense let me check come on yeah she was going to be drowned
huh
okay we are going to go to lunch soon okay if you feel sick let me know okay especially if you need the restroom alright let us see the only thing i would recommend andrew andrew
alright what i would probably do because these are kind of hard to read i would probably have put these off to the side so that they would be easier to read cause you are going to see that done that way a lot on graphs okay very nice alright you okay take a breath do not you have her paper for the you said you what
she said she is a yeah 0 that is on i was just i was just wanting to what you did wrong what would you mess up on i said it is okay but she is not it looks like 2 it looks like 10
yeah we have an extra one you can use that one that is fine can i get water okay you just got water 5 questions about your graph he got a he got to make a make a key yep you need a key and you need a .
how do you got to make a key title key and title please 0 like that 0 what did you mess up on
okay let us let us do this start here and go around okay go ahead
let me see what you do we will make sure you get it right alright so we have got 20 for the food
okay and then 30 for games good keep going movies is 5 so that is going to be to where here yep very good now make me a key down at the bottom so i know what each color represents please missus missus .
let us get stephanie to help you
is not that food the green one let us see what we are doing alright keep going alright so then you have what
and 2020 okay now hold on because here is what you are going to need here is where here is where i think we are getting confused you got to do this 5 huh and then this 10 is going to bring us to what
up to then to here is going to be .
so that is going to be your 20 it is just not going to be it is just not going to end on a whole line this way it is going to end ther perfect okay and then .
alright and then we have what is next toys for 10 thank you again right here you are welcome perfect and then what do you have left savings my voice sounds fun funny savings which is 15 beautiful that is exactly right is this okay miss name i kind went outside the lines
on purpose say that again you know how the sentences that have more than like to subtract what is the difference between the amount of money i would spend on this and the amount of money i would spend on that what is the difference use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea
what now
time out purple yellow orange alright so you got 2 more keep going yes can i go to miss name today i am going to go get some bread for me
no clap clap clap alright i am going to give you about 5 more minutes to finish up what you can what you do not finish in class we will finish for homework but take the next few minutes get as far as you can so that i can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home this are savings this to food i was supposed to do 20 on the games but then i messed up
but then i did fine alright 506070809100 did you just add savings yeah 0 okay that is cool it just threw me off i was like wait a 2nd how did we do that okay i follow you we are good okay so you have 10 for savings 10 for movies movies 10 for games 5 for books and then 40 twen 1020304045 for clothes and 20 for food perfect
that works hold on hold on i am just right here alright so you definitely have a large clothing budget i will need a bigger closet yes okay that will be in your next budget alright here is what i want you to do next excellent job turn it over i want you to ask 5 questions that somebody could answer from your graph okay can i put he loves clothes could they ans .
they actually might be able to answer that from your graph but yeah 5 questions based on your graph
alright let me take a look at it
excellent now flip it over i want you to come up with 5 question that somebody could answer by using your graph okay beautiful i know right like it alright what is the sum of all the data okay good what does the green part of the graph mean what is the .
one moment please what is the least percent how much okay good now would you be able to answer those questions alright go ahead and answer those questions we should be wrapping it up in just a moment is it okay if if i put the questions on here that is fine
yep i see 2 things i am missing what just just one okay so i am missing your title and what else just that what else just that how about .
show me a key
alright so you need a a title and a .
i am finished mar marcy is giving you a hint key and you got 5 questions alright let us take a look yeah you got to write 5 questions do you have any white out no that is okay just put one line through it and then write the word again there you go make sure your name is on it we are just about finished
yes you may
ooh say that again
that is okay there is a .
can i get another sheet of paper no just do it on the back this one is fine i messed it up it is fine no it is fine do it how much more money did i spend on food than clothes but can i say 1st the movies you could say how much more money did i spent on food than clothes and movies altogether nah okay can not i put my fun chart
very colorful it is bright colors jaydon jaydon yes andrea is not in here i can not talk to her yet okay i will talk to her when she gets in here alright 54321
0 go ahead and put your markers crayons down stop where you are at thank you ben thank you max excellent job andrew everything down ready to listen again alright we are going to do one last thing before we leave for success maker i want us to take a look back at our graph
now that we have had a chance to color our own graphs let us try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph who wants to start us off i think there is probably one that is easier than the rest of them that is just my opinion martinez what do you think i think the the blue one is 50 alright why do you think the blue s ladies
why do you think the blue section is 50% cause it is it is half of that okay excellent job it is half we know that 50% and half are the exact same thing so we are going to go ahead and label this section 50% i think that is an excellent estimate andrew do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us the orange one is 25 okay what makes you think the orange one is 25%
say that one more time 4 of those equals 100 excellent job so basically what andrew is saying is that this section is like 14th of the circle and 14th of the circle would be 25% excellent job i would agree with that so how much have i used up so far 75% i have used up 75% so i only have 25% left naya what section do you want to label for us the biographies
biographies is the yellow section what do you think i think it is like small 15 okay yeah 15 because cause b the green and the yellow is 25 so if you take off like a little bit of it .
you are on the right track you are saying it exactly right it is just kind of hard to explain i think what you are i what i am hearing you say is that this section will be 25% so we have to decide if this section is 25% this would have to be like 15 or 20 and this would have to be like 5 or 10 okay what martinez give us what you think it would be i think it is 15 because if you add the green one and the yellow one it equals the same as 25
so half of this is will be 25 too okay so half of 25 is 15 i have got to say i agree with you all is reasoning i think that this is somewhere between 15 and 20% and this is somewhere between 5 and 10% so let us say 15% and 10% now double check let us make sure that we have 100% before we move on 50 and 25 would be 7575 and 10 would be 8585
85 and 15 a 180 a 100 a 100% excellent job alright any questions before we move on naya i know it is an estimate but at 1st i was at least thinking that the green part was 5 okay at 1st glance i am kind of leaning between 5 and 10% and naya brought up a good point this is an estimate okay now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount but for our purposes this is an estimate i am glad that you brought that up again ben
right because it is an estimate if we had done 20% here and 5% here that would also have given us the 25% the most important thing i want you to take from looking at this would we ever said this amount was 45% no no it is not anywhere near half of the circle so that is what i want us to be keeping in mind while we are doing and making our own circle graphs alright excellent job today if you did not finish we will finish it for homework i am going to call groups to line up for success maker
let me get table 5 go ahead and line up
and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys yes so they can hear you also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color 13rd 13rd i do not have marker colors to match everything
i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
and the pink pink is what kyla
it is not important really right now just ignore 14th please 14th thank you and i am hearing a lot of talking again deanthony you have not raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything better
who can tell me which color i need to pull out next raise your hand if you can tell me what color is next akasia one 5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th what do we do now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
i am sorry i am going to wait for a 2nd really nicholas all the little noises need to stop that shows me you are not focused at all and it disturbs other people around you they stop yes ophelia
okay but i was thinking ophelia when we did it i think we might have done one 8th next thank you so let us go to one 8th please and one 8th is purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths so purple is one 8th yes ian how wait where was number one why was that one there
i see deshanique talking right now i see malcolm moving yes colby
yeah because it is aqua it is aqua thank you colby for raising your hand okay and white is one 6th everybody get your white ones out one 6th yes nicholas uhh
i do not really remember
yeah so you just i mean .
panther pride so if 0 i forgot to put one thing up there what is one half of one 6th one half of what hand raised please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking nicholas you do not even have it there
what would one half of 16th be one 12th one 12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th and one 12th is what color blue red or is it red actually it was supposed to be brown blue okay
this is one 16th blue is yeah okay so red is one whoa whoa
all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things all eyes up here please all hands empty we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again
we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip so you have another way to really see what you are doing when you are adding and subtracting your fractions and we are also going to use them to model multiplication which we have not really done before
in the past few days or probably a week i have asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply if i am doing 3 times 2 what is another way to describe that problem i am multiplying 3 times 2 what are 2 ways to solve that problem
i can just multiply and i know it is 3 times 2 but what is another way paige adding 3 add so multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add 3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times
so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition to figure out how to multiply those fractions
so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with so let us try one 12th times 3 how could you solve the problem one 12th times 3
one 12th times 3 what does that mean one 12th times 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem i used i used one of these 12s okay and use all my 3s
okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s 3 how many 3s did we need 111 how many 3s did we need 2222 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need how many okay when we do 3 times 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need
3 i need 3 31 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please 31 12 ths akasia please share with kyla or share with colby actually
3 or 21 12 ths what was that 3 or 2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths nicholas okay is it show me please show me please
i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk please do it and especially share with jabari paige has her 31 12 ths malcolm has has 31 12 ths malcolm can you organize those line them up next to each other please deshanique do you have your 31 12 ths put them in front of you on your desk umm okay got it
okay panther pride so one 12th times 3 equals what one 12th times 3 equals what what is it kendall 3 12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right
if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3 if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan thank you thank you
boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths
find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please 3 12 ths show me on your desk is that it show me please line them up next to each other
deanthony you can you please get this here what was your way maybe it is definitely 14th all right
akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths one 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths no 14th 14th 14th show me please i do not see it on your desk i see that you have it out but can you please show me 4 times 3 right here does 14th equals 3 12 ths yes yes it does
14th equals 3 12 ths yes deshanique
umm i would like to find please find how many 16 ths are equal to 14th show me on your desk please how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we know 3 12 ths and 14th are equal
how many 16 ths equal 14th one 16th
calm down okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to we do not really need this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th
4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we just figured out 3 12 ths equals one fouth let us see how many sixteenths equal 14th
please stop whispering malcolm please stop umm not sure you go ahead and press focus right there it is just light it is okay
okay so 14th 0 there it is it is brighter 14th equals okay 14th equals 4 16 ths so what kind of multiplication problem could we write to describe that
14th times something equals 4 16 ths what would our multiplication problem be akasia go ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times 4 fourths is it 4 fourths yes 14th times how many one fourths did we use i am sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault
i wrote that very wrong so 4 16 ths 0 yes hold on here one 16th one 16th times something equals 14th thank you maisie now i do not know you do know one 16th times something sorry maisie
so akasia here is 14th one 16th times all right colby do you know what boys and girls too many of us are not following the rules
i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering this is what it should sound like malcolm akasia go ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes
one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this one times 4 equals 4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths wait until christian comes back please
christian is coming i can not even the number
christian come on quickly okay okay so how about if we added 4 16 ths +14th what fraction would we come up with 4 16 ths +one 4th
4 16 ths +14th you can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator colby and deanthony stop
i am just trying to get your 4 16 ths +14th akasia you got it figured out already
you know it is something on the alphabet on the alphabet yeah what do you mean
umm akasia please get focused
kyla try it please 4 16 ths +one 4th christian did you figure it out is that why you are waving your hand around no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out deanthony do you have it figured out panther pride panther pride
thank you that is better i am glad you are excited but it is way too noisy umm
christian and deshanique will you please come show us how you solve the problem
okay 4 16 ths +14th i will try to help you get it off the camera it is okay everybody has them in front of them anyway go ahead share with your classmates so how we figured this problem out is 12nd let me see if your classmates are listening to you hands are empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk akasia in your chair
deanthony and colby you are listening you are not whispering at all go ahead so how we solved the problem was we put 16th right here and 14th right here did you put 16th right here how many sixths did you put here how many 4 4 16 ths +14th equals one half can you show me please
okay so 4 16 ths +14th equals one half so we have been doing these problems but what have we been doing instead of modeling them adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla add we are still adding but what did we do differently what did we have to do 1st
1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what 4 times 4 equals 6 equals i mean 16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be 4 fourths
4 what right there yep
stand up and walk please all right kyla is going to prove to us malcolm and kendall that 14th +4 16 ths equals what kyla how many 16 ths 88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction one half very good
okay let us prove it okay so one half also equals everybody everybody 8 16 ths thank you
okay because you are playing with that i was they were not it does not matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary i need all eyes up here eyes jabari if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can
it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions we only really did one example that just reminded me okay have a seat please kyla thank you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be one 16th times 3
please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3 kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it colby is about to try
good kendall is working it out i got it kendall has got it i got it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try and go put those cushions back in the classroom library thank you take ian is too maisie has got it akasia has got it
nicholas has it 0 i did it panther pride ophelia i still see you talking akasia one 16th times 3 equals one 6th
one 16th times 3 where are you showing me on your desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 3 16 ths may i have panther pride
ian thank you i see that you are quiet christian put that away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 0 well the 1st way i knew is because we did it before and did we do it before yeah we did we did
and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one okay one times 3 equals 33 and then
thank you deshanique thank you ian thank you kendall and nicholas and malcolm okay 16 times one is 16 now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that you place it down thank you akasia kyla i need you paying attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please why did i put the one down here
what does 3 over one mean or 31st what does that mean ophelia well a girl means that i know why but it was the it was done because because if you multiply 16 by 3 it would not make any sense because then you would have 3 something something and not really ready to do that math
but but the denominator would have to stay the same but if you multiplied it by anything but one it would not be the same okay let us think too though about what 3 divided by one means remember that fractions also represent division problems so 3 divided by one equals what 333 divided by one equals 3
so if i write 3 in my numerator and one in my denominator i am really still just writing the number 3 but i can see that when i multiply or add one 16th 3 times i have 3 16 ths kyla turn around please get focused again one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
let us try a different one seeing as i would already done that problem how about 14th times 314 times 3 show me please show me show me show me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip i do not have a 3rd so i can not show you 14th times 3
it is easy 14th times 3 deshanique has it paige has it malcolm has not done it yet show me please you show me what 14th times 3 looks like
did any fall 3 fourths that is important jabari please show me 14th times 3
once you show me is this 3 fourths right here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths what is this
panther pride thank you for your patience one 4th times 3 so jabari what did we figure out 14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction thank you one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay
umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions deshanique you want one more yeah i want one you know this already though do not you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right me too how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore
2 sixths times 4 give it a try 2 sixths times 4 how would we do that work it out please in front of you 2 sixths times 4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers show me what is the problem no show me 2 sixths times 4
turn around show me jabari show me 2 sixths times 4 there are not any how can you make 2 thirds and you might have to participate with somebody next to you also okay
it is not 8 12 ths ian you are going to have to cooperate with these 2 we need to share because 2 sixths times 4 did you make a substitution or
thank you ian thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
paige it is their turn to share get ready to listen please
deshanique we should be quiet and listening to our classmates akasia listening please boys and girls i am listening for silence right now maisie lift your head up
kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening jabari i see you pretty ready justin is ready that equals 2 let me see if i can help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please
your classmates are not ready deshanique ophelia we are listening malcolm you must listen to each other akasia have a seat kyla put both of your feet on the floor and listen
how did you get those 8 sixths though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening getting better put that down
put your hands down and pay attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place how did you decide you needed that many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please
what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari 2 how many did we need what was our original problem i do not know if you can see it over here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please what was our original problem jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down what 2 6 ths times 4
okay 2 sixths times 4 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then 2 sixths times 4 equals 26 times right here nicholas 26 times 4 equals is what 8 6 ths
okay do you see that akasia 1234567 okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction
okay okay so one and 2 sixths once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed mixed number they had one and 2 sixths so jabari how many sixths does it take to make 11
how many sixths does it take to make one how many sixths does it take to make one jabari jabari what does the denominator tell us what does the denominator of a number tell us colby
the number tells you like like like how much it is in the whole how many what in the whole what do you mean by how much how much whatever you are how many parts 0 parts equal parts how many equal parts so jabari how many equal parts do you need to make a whole if each part is 16th
jabari you need 6 sixths to make one whole 6 sixths equals one right okay you guys are going to try some of these on your own yes you may now
can i go to the bathroom what was that what was the question kendall
are we allowed to do our work under this yeah of course
please stop chitter chatting
yep looks good i need my bag you do not need your bag
is this wrong miss is this wrong
what would 3 thirds be if you have 3 parts 3 parts altogether you have 3 parts of the 3 altogether
okay so not right now you could do that you can work it up that way or you can work it up with a strip
okay 2 4 ths
panther pride panther pride one of your classmates has a request for some silent time and i do not disagree spend the next few minutes working without talking you are facing your own paper kyla akasia already yes leila umm
akasia please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit what was that yep
nicholas keep the congratulations inside your head for a few minutes so it is okay that is not a big deal
kendall they are here i am sorry nicholas wow we did not even last for one minute paige it is silent time right now
boys and girls kyla
you are sitting there doing nothing
are we getting our work done no
alright 23230 is great okay boys and girls today we are going to talk about fractions and before we talk about anything i want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions okay let us see what we know about fractions what do you know about fractions it is when like a square or when it is divided up into 4
that would probably be a fraction okay when a square is broken up into 4 and a few are shaded in that is a fraction okay what else do we know about fractions let us see what else do we know about fractions the top number is the denominator and bottom is the numerator okay let us think about that for a minute what do you know about fractions
the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the the denominator okay what else do we know about fractions does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole hold on one sec there is fraction that you can do with a half or a whole no i said that fractions have to do with . 0 they have to do with a half or whole okay what else do we think we know about fractions
okay we are going to talk about what the top number is called and what the bottom number is called go ahead isaac what do you know about fractions the .
if there is a shape you can split them in half who else has something to add about fractions fractions are like a piece of a shape factions are a piece of a shape caleb
if it is a circle it is one whole okay we are we are we are getting all of these things we are going to clarify them in a minute let us see if what we are saying is valid or what what we are saying is true any other thoughts about fractions last thoguht diana what do you have there is a certain way to write the to write it down there is a certain way to write it down okay alright lots of information
lots of good thinking then let us see if we can not clarify some of that okay the 1st thing to know about a fraction is a fraction is either part of a whole or part of a group of things okay we could call the whole we could call it a whole
we could call it a region what else could we call it
that it that is all you got okay it is part of that whole or region a fraction is also a part of a group of things or we could call it a set of things alright so this is my whole region and this is my group i want a part of that not only do i want a part of it i want an equal part of it
okay because that is very important when you are talking about fractions you are going to take an equal part of a whole re or region or an equal part of a set okay so i want equal parts here my whole how can i break that equal part up into fractions how can i break that whole up into fractions
you can put a line in the middle or if you doing 4 you can put one down in the middle i want half so i want i want to cut something in half one line in the middle right in the middle okay i want an equal amount on one side and an equal amount on the other side so i just did what to that hole i cut it in half half so i am going to label that half a half okay
and how i label it is i take the number of pieces i cut this into how many pieces 222 right 12 the number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the denominator denominator
okay or the bottom number some of you told me right that is the denominator the number of pieces i shaded in is called the .
numeral nu mer a tor everybody say it
numerator numerator okay so that whole i cut into 2 equal pieces the number of pieces i cut it into was the denominator ayana and the number of pieces i want or i want to shade in or i want to see is the numerator okay so if this is one half one half and one half right
one half here one half here how many halves make a whole 22 okay this is my group this is my set how many are there there is 66 so what is my denominator going to be 66 and i say these are jellybeans and i am hungry this afternoon and i want to eat 3 of those jelly beans
kay that is my fraction what is the numerator 333 cause i ate 3 of those jelly beans or i colored them in cause i know i am going to eat them cause i am hungry alright so my nu or my fraction is 3 out of 6 i colored in 3 out of 6 i am going to eat 3 out of 6 i am going to get fat okay the 3 jellybeans alright so the top number is the number that you are shading in
okay and the bottom number is the one that you shaded in is the number of pieces or the number in the set or the group okay you guys think you understand that
yes are you good okay so now we know numerator is the top number okay how many pieces you are shading in or how many out of that group you are talking about and the denominator is the .
 bottom number the number of pieces in your whole or the number out of the whole set out of the group okay so here we have how many out of how many
66 alright so that is just some of your vocabulary numerator and denominator if you are going to be working in your center with vocabulary cards if you are going to match your vocabulary word with what it means with its meaning okay 0 so it is kind of like go fish it is kind of like go fish
i would like you to play concentration with them 1st that means all of them go upside down and you are going to flip 2 over and see if they match
0 okay alright so that is your 1st centers right here your vocabulary words are are you listening yep numerator denominator hey equivalent fraction what does this mean let us think listen to the word equivalent what word do you hear in the word equiliv equivalent equal caitlin
equal so one fraction has to match the other fraction just like this set right here i colored in one half of this square right and here how many circles did i color in
3 that is half half of those circles yes yes okay here is one half the circle and here is the other half this is shaded in this is not so 3 sixths is the same as one half one half they are the same thing okay they are equivalent fractions i could do this with my region okay
here is my whole region whoops sorry here it is okay i could make this into 6 pieces can not i
okay so i am going to get it into 6 pieces and i am going to do the same thing i am going to color in half so now it is not halves i am talking about it is what sixths and how many did i color in
3 okay so one half is the same as .
3 sixths okay those are equivalent fractions caitlin or it could be like 48s 48s is an equivalent faction it is half of the set 4 is half of 83 is half of 61 is half of 2 wait it is ooh can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then we have got one half 3 sixths
somebody said for 8s michael 5 tenths 5 tenths because 5 is half of 10 brianna 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths give me another 11020s 10 twentieths yes absolutely great job isaac can i use the bathroom quickly
that is okay go ahead go ahead 9 eighteenths 9 eighteenths thank you isaac dante 51 hundredths 51 hundredths good good job okay you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions that is the question i was going to ask what that if anything is half of a num if the numerator half of the denominator good it is an equivalent fraction it is an equivalent .
w no it is an equivalent fraction to one half it has to be equivalent to a fraction it is equivalent to one half okay so do you understand what equivalent fractions are yes okay they they they cover the same area or they name the same part of a set
okay equivalent fractions the next word is fraction what is a fraction what is it a a region or a whole that is not a fraction this is not a fraction this is that region of that whole piece that is not a fraction is it no it is a equal lateral
whoa you guys are crazy it is an equal amount of a whole okay half and half quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter how many quarters is that 444
a quarter or a 4th a 4th a 4th and a 4th what if it equals a whole equals a whole it is a whole right okay so it is a part of a whole or a part of a set but it has to be equal part you have to remember that okay equal part a mixed number is .
a fract a whole number and a fraction okay a whole number and fraction so i wrote on the board 2 and one half it is a whole number and a fraction that is called a mixed number who can give me another mixed number a whole number and a fraction
give me a whole number and a fraction
4 fourths 4 and i need a fraction now take one from the board and one fourths good 4 and 3 sixths is a mixed number it is a whole number plus a fraction give me a mixed number 5 and one half good 5 and one half
it is a whole number and a fraction dante 5 and 6 6 thirds i mean 3 sixths sixths 5 and 3 sixths good giving me a mixed number 8 and 2 sixths 8 and 2 sixths is a whole number and a fraction good caitlin
8 and 6 6 and 4 eighths 6 and 48s do you understand mixed numbers
what is a mixed number
a whole number and a fraction okay got it okay one of the other vocabulary words is an improper fraction an improper fraction is another way to say a mixed number okay an improper fractions has a larger numerator .
over a smaller denominator 0
if you look this is 2 and a half is not it yes it is 2 wholes and one half it is also an improper fraction what what how many halves is it 2 and how many halves is it let us count them 2
let us count them 123455 halves is not that 5 halves yeah yes so this is the mixed number and this is the improper fraction 0 so there is like 2 wholes and 5 halves there are 2 wholes and one half 0
and there are 12345 halves these are the same 2.5 and 5 halves got it huh sure yes a little bit yes okay i think the only other vocabulary words you need to know benchmark fractions i am going to let you figure that out on your own using the definition okay
because you know what a benchmark is we have talked about benchmarks all year and then the last vocabulary word is .
 is called simplest form simiplest form that is another one i am going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings okay so there are your meanings there are your definitions is there a problem right here okay
i did not write on my hand
thank you alright vocabulary cards look vocabulary cards okay flip them over read all of them flip them upside down and play concentration alright next center right here you know you are doing your addition and subtraction practice addition and subtraction
there is extra paper right in the back okay this center right here can i just borrow that just the top part honorable 12nd shh keep listening cause you are doing this 1st i have gone over this already turn the question around into your answers okay
so you are going to read the 11 fraction word problems turn the question around and and answer in complete sentences check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer okay jaylon you hold this one it goes right here right here yep pass out paper to these 6 people right here in this center
do not forget to ttqa alright okay and my group right here you are coming back with me 1st okay so carefully to the back table with a pencil yes makenzie you may use the bathroom now honey carefully to the back table with a pencil what can i go to the bathroom yep go quick
and come back quick what is it ashley never mind you all set okay alright do not forget you are working shh in centers
so you should be whispering dylan can you put that back on the sill for me honey let us take one of these chairs out so you are not squished
alright yes please use your problem solving skills
yes dear i hit my arm now it is feeling like now it feels like it went to sleep 0 it is just tingles you hit your funny bone it feels weird can you put your name please who are we missing right yeah she is at the bathroom and ayana who .
ayana christian
so put your name and date and i will be right with you okay you are working in a center here so you may quietly consult with each other
quietly consult alright everybody has name and date on paper okay somebody tell me what is a fraction we just discussed that what is a fraction
what is a fraction it is a equal .
 parts parts equal part of a whole right either a whole region like now we have regions on our paper or a whole set of something right okay so if i had a candy bar if i did and it was a hershey is and you know hersheys come in little squares right and you have to break them apart okay
let us say that our hershey is bar had 6 sections in it okay can you imagine that in your head close your eyes 0 no i am not bringing candy in here close your eyes and think about it can you see that chocolate bar yes i can see it clearly
no honey you got to listen so now we have 6 pieces in our chocolate bar right and if this chocolate bar had to be shared equally .
how many pieces would each of them get 3 and how do you know that cause this is the nominator denominate yeah denominator what is the denominator i do not know how to explain it but okay
i just said that that candy bar had to be shared by 2 people right right good and how many pieces of candy did i say was in that one candy bar 66 so the whole candy bar has how many pieces 6 so what do we call that number denominator yeah because that is the number of pieces that the candy bar is in 6 now .
if you 2 share that candy bar cheyenne told me that you would get how many pieces 33 so what is the vocabulary word for the number 3 we already know that 6 is the denominator what is the vocabulary word for that number 3 christian vocabulary for the number 3
yep nominator 0 wow okay we are all going to say this word numerator say it numerator one more time numerator numerator that is right so 3 pieces each that is the we just said it numerator out of
6 pieces in the candy bar we call that the .
denominator you guys are getting these words really mixed up listen numerator and denominator listen the 3 is the numerator can you say it please
christian you say it please 3 is the numerator yep do not star say it again the numerator michael you say it 6 is the denominator good 3 is the numerator
numerator cause if you get them mixed up here and you and read a paper that says what number is the numerator you really need to know which one is which okay so the 3 is the numerator
okay so 6 is the denominator you say it 6 is the denominator what is what the 6 called denominator denominator go quickly please michael denominator denominator yeah denominator correct i can not hear you denominator good denominator denominator perfect so how many pieces are there in the candy bar
3 how many is cheyenne going to eat 3 so 3 sixths plus another 3 sixths equals 6 sixths yeah you are right it equals 6 sixths or the whole candy bar excellent what is it may i go to the bathroom when christian comes back please turn around yes alright
so we have rectangular paper right this is going to be our region or our whole okay
yes you should okay we are going to take our 1st rectangle what what are the dimensions of a rectangle what does it tell us the dimensions of a rectangle are what are the dimensions of your rectangle makenzie what are the dimensions of the rectangle
look at your paper well 4 times 4 times 6 for by 6 okay 4 times 6 or 4 by 6 isaac have a seat
so i am going to pretend this is my new candy bar there is not 6 pieces anymore are there no no so if it is a 4 by 6 rectangle how many pieces of candy are in this candy bar 644 by 64 times 6
michael honorable come on thank you michael thanks okay see when you are paying attention you are right on sit up straight alright good so now we have the 4 by 6 right or 4 times 6 for 24 pieces 24 pieces i want to split this delicious huge candy bar with makenzie and only makenzie okay
alright if i were to find .
i want to separate this 4 by 6 rectangle into 2 equal pieces so makenzie and i have the same amount well let us see let us cut this candy bar in half everybody take their pencil take their pencil cut this rectangle in half
okay i just cut mine in half cut mine in half and i made half and half so i am going to leave a half over here and half over here okay so i have got one half here and one half here
alright so we have got this huge candy bar we just cut it in half right how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half how do i know i cut it in half prove it to me prove that we just cut this huge .
prove it i do not know if that is the right line i do not if i i cut it exactly i do not know if i cut it exactly in half
beautiful job excellent explanation absolutely right so let us count and make sure each side has 12 why is your hand raised honey i do not know i do not either let us let us count each half and make sure there is 12 in each half 12 count yours 456789101112 on one side and i know if there is 12 on one side . there has to be 12 on the other side because 12 +12 equals 24
24 awesome christian i do not know what you are doing sweetheart so scoot yourself in listen to the conversation and cut your great big 4 by 6 rectangle in half with your pencil not with scissors just with your pencil
take a pencil line right i did not say to shade anything in cause if we shade it in we will not be able to count the number of squares no we did not okay i am i am good right now i know that makenzie and i are going to get the same amount
we are each going to get 12 small pieces okay this is what i am going to do next so we all are we all on the same page now are we all on the same page now okay almost alright now i cut my candy bar in half and i gave half to makenzie so we are both going to get going to have to jog a little bit right makenzie okay
now this is what i want you to do i want you to go to your next rectangle now it says 4 by 6 rectangle so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units 24 i want you to find another way not the way that we used the 1st time but find another way to give me 2 equal pieces i want .
i want a half look at your look at your paper i want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half so that both christian no christian does not like chocolate both michael and ayana get equal number of pieces go ahead go to your next rectangle go to your next rectangle
nope i want halves i want to see halves go to your next rectangle okay waiting for you find a new way so that michael and ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar okay well you know what
i am going to get a different example not chocolate bar for you okay christian maybe it maybe it will be pizza okay let us see i want to see another way to make one half on your paper makenzie are we done girls yes okay label it like we labeled the 1st one i label this half and this half
and i know that one half +one half is the whole candy bar okay did you find a new way i am looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing
because if they are not something needs to be done about it isaac what is wrong nothing okay okay let us see if we found a different way
vertically up and down in half he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half
he cut it in half i know there is 1224681012 here so there must be 24681012 here what is wrong 0 the there you need to write the the how many squares are in that no that is not the issue nope we did not need it shaded in who knows what is wrong
what is wrong makenzie
0 what is wrong one halfs are in the wrong position
on the top and on the bottom right cause this is half up here and this is half down here can i show you what i did good job you just labeled it wrong good job christian half on the top and a half on the bottom cheyenne did you have a different way we all have the same ways no she does not she made hers diagonally me
nice job makenzie let us see yours same way yeah i did mine diagonally did you label and did you label properly michael what do you have honey same thing nice job 0 d let us think about that would diagonal count let us let us think about it that is a good question
who thinks yes if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner you have a half what do you think do you have the same number on top and on bottom no yes absolutely good look at me nice job nice job
if you are cutting something in half if you take it diagonally and they are the same number on one side as there re on the other side it is definitely halves
i split one whole okay so on top you would right one half and on the bottom you would write one half 0 i did that i did that
does anybody have a different way i did diagonal no other ways to make half and half let me ask you a question 0 sit down please ayana it is not a talent show it is not a fashion show have a seat alright yes christian said well what about diagonally the other way would that work yeah
absolutely okay would it be like possible to like make a circle and then hm probably not a circle probably not a circle now let me ask you a question can we put the plus sign how many small squares in each half you guys should know that right now how many small squares how many square units are in each half 12 thank you michael 12 here and 12 here why
because 12 +12 equals 24 alright so if you have 24 small squares in one side in one half i am sorry 12 square units in one half and 12 square units in the other half do you still have halves know i mean yes yes so let us see how else we could cut this in half well there is 2
and there is 8 and there is and there is watch 2 how much do we have to split it in can you just hold on a 2nd hold on a sec ayana hold on a sec means stop okay okay
take a look at what i did cheyenne
let us look let us count you ready
123456789101112123456789101112 so is that half yes absolutely 12 +12 is 24 half of 24 is 12 can anybody come up with another way
0 i think i can take another of your 4 by 6 rectangles so what do you think i think i know another way show me another way that is your challenge i challenge you to make one more different way one more different half to make 1212 in one half 12 in the other i challenge you
did you make sure that you counted and there are 12 in each side or each piece has 12
can we shade it in i know one where is wait where is you one half i do not see that you separated this rectangle anywhere i do not see 2 halves in your rectangle dang it
if you find another way i want you to try one more way okay be right back how we doing girls good how is this group doing good you doing okay huh where is is savannah your group yeah nice job did you guys go through the cards once yeah did you win no no did savannah win
yeah yes please yep that is what it says on your paper did you guys play one time yeah who won 0 congratulations yeah i got like 4 okay i kept on guessing but i got it this group all set you do not tell the teacher that you guessed
it said something it said something that is on the top i do not think it said that i think the point of the game is to guess yeah you find the definition for a numerator what is a benchmark well where are your what are your matches show me your matches we just put them down 0 you just put them down did everybody check each other is work yes okay
you show me you can put them all flip them all over right now and just match them for me so i can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are okay flip em all over good put them in matches you too do the same thing flip them all over and put them in matches yeah can i get a band aid a band aid what happened honey
wash your hands with soap and water i will be right over
yep that is what it says awesome centers are almost over 5 minutes what honey there are 4 centers i did not say you were going to do them all today 0 miss richards i found 2 ways ooh show me i did this yay i did this
show me 0 that is awesome yes alright let us see christian show us yours okay so 1st you know what i am just going to go over it with green so we can see it okay kay did you check to make sure there is 12 in each yeah
awesome and which which other ones 123456789101112 nice job christian woah did you say you did 2 more 0 well hold on to that one everybody look at christian is last rectangle makenzie michael and cheyenne and ayana
so right here okay but the thing is you have plenty of paper so you work it out on paper you have made a half christian 2 halves make a whole somewhere on your papers boys and girls i want you to write the number sentence one half +one half equals 11 whole you made another one let us see
123456789101112 nice job ayana show everybody guys take a look at ayana is 12 good work did you do another one the 2nd one ooh nice everybody take a peek 6789101112 good for you any more
and there is even 12 in this in this box i did this what
yep okay and the other halves did you make another one i want to make another one i want to see one more from you makenzie i am not sure what you are doing over there but you are you are i made 2 writing numbers like crazy show me what you are doing
what is this one
it is kind of like similar kind of like similar i hope you are making halves and not fourths or 20 fourths like this you have got you have made 1234567891011 twelfths you made twelfths cool but not what we are doing okay
as many pieces as you cut your whole into christian no it is not because you have made look all of these lines you are cutting this is one little piece that is one piece 0 get it and there is 12 of these pieces with 2 square units in them
you definitely have to get rid of the lines i would just get rid of the let me see which 11234567891011 twelfths nice job 12s what did i say 12 square units one half you have made half this is way easy i am so glad that it is way easy this it is easier than way easy this is not half sweetheart halves are 2 pieces to make one whole
you have got more than 2 pieces here right yeah .
you have got to take everything out except for the one line that you are using to cut your 4 by 6 rectangle in half okay where do we go 0 wait a minute mister halves all the square unit come over here okay i did one hold on where show me
i just made another one i do not under i do not see the halves did you do this boom boom boom boom there is one piece right there that is not 12 that is not nope nope nope nope nope
you have got to have 12 square units in each of your pieces let me see
123456789101112
alright you guys listen how many people i need you to sit down ayana but you know what cause then we just you are sharing ideas here it is not hah it is not good to be selfish at the teacher table have a seat have a seat that is okay that is alright it is okay we are learning and sharing okay what do we do
no but sweetheart once you stop right here and here that is your piece you can use halves but it has to equal 12 square units so this only equals 12345 wholes and a half is 6 that is only 6 square units not 12 this
you are trying to make fourths we are going to talk about that next nicholas are you all set all set okay listen up i will be right there nick have a seat how many people think they mastered halves and they are all set with halves alright i am going to give you a challenge now
i am going to challenge you and i am going to walk away your challenge put your hand down to fill the rest of these nope your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your 4 by 6 rectangle into fourths what okay listen listen listen 1st i will come over and look at yours in a sec but do not we need different numbers listen
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units would be in a 4th sh are you listening i need everybody is eyeballs looking at me please makenzie michael
if there are 12 square units in a half how many square units will be in a 4th so you need to cut your rectangles into 4 pieces now not just 2 cause the denominator is going to be 4
you need to cut it into 4 pieces and i am going to show you one and then you guys are going to take off alright watch watch watch you made halves like this right yes i cut my halves in half into fourths into fourths
and i made fourths so these fourths have how many square units in them 4 no i mean 66 so your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into 4s fourths but the same is 6 and the number of square units is 6 that is right do we have a number yep we do
alright so your new task is to cut this into 4s for me that is hard do you think it is possible it is possible to do for 4s well if this is possible to do for a half do you think this is possible to do for 4s absolutely nice job go sit down i want to see them okay if you need more paper it is here and makenzie i am going to come and look at your halves for you
let me see that one is halves 1234567891011120 it is right here i am sorry 1234567 i i just made a new it goes 12345 567891011121314 i did it like this 123456789101112
0 right here okay i see that now good job makenzie excellent excellent you got halves and you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here fourths makenzie here you go honey i do not know what is going on here but i am i am hoping it has to do with your center lovely kay guys i did it are you finished with your centers
yes lovely i did it but i did not ttqa you did not ttqa well i am going to hand it back to you because that was the direction adam are you all set yes yes what happened 0 i i put my chair back and it hit the desk did he injure you in any way no thank goodness scoot in excuse me miss richards
because it says to no i gave you this paper in case you needed scrap okay this is the paper if you needed scrap paper okay that is fine that is fine
i know go sit down i know i know what isaac is doing
now you have fourths this is going straight down okay that is fourths my guy that is fourths good job yep okay i told this group to bring do you have all your matches together and you have all your matches together let us see if they isaac go have a seat
finish your center you have got 3 minutes
let us read i do have my glasses did you help i hope you helped over here okay a number that has a whole number and a fraction a whole number and a fraction is that called a look at me is that called simplest form what is that called mixed number oops let us fix that one okay
you have a sheet please
so today we are going to keep exploring -and positive numbers i am just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday so it says a negative number is a number that is less than 0 so i think anthony you were the one that said that right so anthony is right negative numbers have value that is less than 0
does anyone know what do we call numbers like 1234 +positive numbers and positive numbers have a value that is greater than 0 so 0 is kind of in between right it is neither positive nor negative it says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number so an example we did was 10 30 equals -20 right
so if you had some of you may have seen well hopefully this has not happened but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the atm and they will say 0 my account is negative so that means that you owe the bank money because at some point either through writing a check or from taking out money you took out more money than you had so now let us say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30
now you are negative $15 uhh a negative number has a minus sign in front of it so that is how we represent a negative number right you might see negative numbers in a game so some of you mentioned golf but also like video games sometimes right i know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative
it will say minus the point or minus however many points uhh a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that is true so if you were working on a number line and it said -4 -3 you would end up with -7 yeah there are negative numbers on a thermometer we talked yesterday about the thermometer right so we looked at it 2 different ways right
this side only has fahrenheit that is what we are used to using for temperature right this side has fahrenheit and celsius and you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer right what were some of the landmark numbers we talked about do you remember 32 degrees fahrenheit which is equal to what do you remember what the celsius is when it is 32 degrees fahrenheit it is what temperature in the celsius 00
and what is that temperature freezing temperature of water that is right 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and we talked about what was that average human body temperature 212 i think it was but you are right what was 212 boiling water boiling of water right and then we talked about bath water is about 110
okay so on the thermometer how many of you have thermometers at home do any of you notice some a lot of times you have digital thermometers now right but some people still have these you might notice depending on what kind of heating system you have it might have like a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down or it might go across to show you some of you mentioned in pools you have seen thermometers like this that help you to know the temperature of the water
all right in the thermostat that is what we call it it shows the temperature there right in a fish tank you might have a thermometer because depending on the type of fish what temperature the water is can be really important a lot of times at the pet store you will see they have these floating thermometers you might see the people that work there they pull it out to check what the temperature is right
and we talked about that on a thermometer we have positive numbers and then we also have negative numbers right when would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer during what season winter right winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers so going back to the chart it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer we just talked about that in golf there are scores with negative numbers
so how many of you watch golf do any of you or play golf so you know that or if you have ever played mini golf you know there is a number of strokes assigned to a hole right so if you let us say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is 3 or 4 let us do 4 that is easier what if you only need 3 strokes to get the golf ball into the hole
what is your score what did you say -one because there it was expected you would need 4 strokes hitting the ball 4 times to get the ball in the hole you only took 3 so it is -one and the more the higher your negative number the better you are doing because that is how many strokes under par so if you did exactly 4 strokes if it took you 4 times hitting the ball to get it into the hole you would be on par which means your score would be 0
if you were under par you get a negative score and that is when the more the higher the negative number you have it actually means you are doing better in the game so if you ever watch a golf game even if you do not watch the whole thing at various points they put up the scores that people have and you will see the top the people that are in the top contention they have negative scores because they are under par okay so maybe the next time you go mini golfing kind of try to pay attention to that okay
negative temperatures are cold temperatures and we did talk about that yesterday yesterday we played temperature bingo right and we talked about in different places you would expect different types of temperatures right where do we expect warmer temperatures all year long all year long we talked about location near the equator you are going to have warmer temperatures all year long arizona because it is closer yep
california and miami we noticed they had warmer temperatures where did we notice the coldest temperatures no matter and the poles right the north pole and the south pole so today you are going to learn a game using -and positive numbers okay so we are going to practice playing the game a couple times together and then you are going to get to play the game with a partner okay so it is really important miguel that you are paying attention the whole time that is why your desk needs to be cleared off
so i am going to start out by showing you the game board so this game is called number line tug of war so
all right i want you to look at this think about what you think the object of the game might be not yet but i am glad you are excited what you think you might have to do to win the game look at the spinner at your table talk to a partner tell me what you think about this game what do you think but how how are you going to win look at what you have you have a spinner you have these spaces here
you have a star over here and a star over here so talk to your partner
orion why do not you go to table 3 and table 4 go to table 4 isaiah come over here segala why do not you join table 4 as well okay
michael can you go see if they are at the end of the hallway because i accidentally just pressed something and i do not know if i turned it off yes 0 let us wait 12nd so i just want to make sure that this is still recording so we do not have to do this all over again is that the microphone got caught on my dress and when i went to move it i pressed something
so i just want to make sure it is still working so well i do not want to press it again in case it is nothing uhh so look at the game board again i am going to remind you what you are thinking about think about what do you see on the spinner why do you think the spinner is designed the way that it is think about this says team one this says team 2 you see stars one star is over on that right side of the team is line
the other side one is on the left side so think about if you did not talk about that why you think there are differences there they were not there no you do
where is the flashing this is flashing okay we are going to assume it is working let us just keep going okay so tell me some things you noticed about the game board there is negative numbers and there is there is +and negative numbers on the spinner does everyone see that remember negative numbers are numbers that are what
less than 0 positive numbers are numbers that are greater than 0 so we have -and positive numbers it is unusual right that they put +0 and -0 because what does that mean you are going to do do nothing you are not going to do anything
you just have to what you do have to use paperclips you are right you are actually going to use 3 paperclips you are going to use one for the spinner that you will put down and then you will use your pencil and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces okay and your game pieces are actually they are going to start at 0 okay what about the stars why do you think there is one star over here and another star .
whichever team gets to the end of the board 1st but which way are they both going the same way no remember i said you are starting at 0 so you are both starting in the same place but what is going to happen over here you are trying to get to what positive number 10 right over here what are you trying to get to -negative so that is a little bit different than a lot of games we are used to right
usually when you are playing a board game you are all trying to get to the same place right you are trying to get to the end so here we have 2 different ends so one team is going to be worried about getting a +positive numbers right the other team is going to really want to get negative numbers okay one of the things that we need to do on here what do we call this in between what is right here a line a number line right
so i am going to just go over this because it is kind of light what do you think i should probably do before starting the game well yes but i am talking about with the number line yeah label it right so let us start with the positive integers 1st because we are used to that so what are we going to put here
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 no the end is at 10 you got to pay attention isaiah now we are going to label so the numbers from 0 moving to the right were the positive integers right the numbers that are greater than 0 and team one is goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers let us label the other side now we are starting with 0
now we are moving to the left what is going to be right here -one -one -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 so and what we can see is from 0 moving to the left we have negative integers numbers that are less than 0 and teams 2 is goal is going to be to reach -10 so what kind of numbers are they hoping to spin on the spinner
-negative numbers now we are going to try playing the game as a group 1st and then we are going to play the game in partners so we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we are doing and then we will play in partners okay so bobby had mentioned you need paperclips right so you are going to get these small paperclips you are going to get one for a spinner then team one puts the paperclip right on 0 do you see
it fits really well right it lines up so it is the perfect size the small paperclips so we start team one at 0 and we start team 2 at 0 you always have to keep in mind your goal team one is trying to get +10 team 2 is trying to get to -10 and obviously whoever reaches their goal 1st is going to win
this might remind you a little bit kind of like football right where 2 different teams are getting to opposite end zones right
they have to go negativeso then they are behind right so they got -2 now they have 12 steps to try and get over that was a good question so yeah if you land on a -one if you are +and you land on negative do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive you just keep spinning so you if you let us say even though they are trying to get positive they got -one then they got -2 so now they are at -3 then they got another negative
they are at -4 now they still have to move back up you do not skip a turn or anything do you use positive to get back up or negative yeah you have to use positive right if they are trying to get that way even though you are on the -one if you move negative spaces you are still on the same game board right and then you have to move this way it is like in a game if you were told to take go 2 places back then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward right
what happens if you are going to the +and you are on -10 and you hit another negative number and you are already on -10 that is the farthest piece on the game board so if you were there yeah you would just stay there till you got a positive you would basically be losing a turn because it only goes to -10 bradley and isaiah you need to be focused and paying attention so whatever you do in isaiah stop all right so i think we will just divide the class in half
so the back of the class is going to be team 2 the front of the class is going to be team one
so bobby your hand went up 1st you can roll for spin for team 11st come on up so think positive team one right +3 wait a minute come over here you got to move this piece right so he is at 0 if you got +3 where should he move to 3 so you can move right on the line very good so i need someone from team 2
segala come on over you are raising your hand nicely so now what should your team be thinking -negative get a negative ah it is on -one okay no it was between it was -one or +2 is more -one
come here segala you forgot to move your game piece so is she going to move her piece to the right or the left left left one space very good now we need another okay rocco your hand came up next yep 0 +3 come here so now if he is at 3 where is he moving to 6 very good okay
alexander your hand came up 1st so you are thinking -0 so what does it mean if you get 0 you stay in the same place all right michael come on up
all right we need to stay quiet 0 stay right where we are bradley come on up remember this whole time we are being good sports and we are paying attention alexander because we want to learn how to play the game 0 +3 so which way do we have to move so you would go 0 that is 112 okay good job
remember it is a game of chance because you are using a spinner so we are always going to be nice to our classmates right because we are learning the game noisha come on over be a positive okay +one there you go
okay jasmine come on up 0 -2 very good
so wait a minute we are at +2 where should she end up at if she got 0 that is right very good remember from 2 to one is one he was at -one and he got 3 so he went to 012 okay makes sense all right who has not come up yet kobe come on up
0 okay uhh alicia come on up there is lots of people whose hands are raised you have to be patient i did not see your hand at 1st if you if you complain is it more likely or less likely that i am going to pick you yes 0
nathan come on up what score does team one need to win 33 +3 let us see
yeah get a -3 please +3 so team one won this time this is what we are going to do stop talking we are going to play the game again we are going to switch so the back group is going to be team one the front group is going to be team 2 so what is your goal now positive 10 wait a minute stop for a minute
if the back row is going to be team one where is your goal on the number line we are +10 if the front row is going to be team 2 what is your goal -10 right where do we need to start both team pieces at 0 okay so team one
isaiah your hand was up 1st so be careful walking around the camera oops so you got -30 wait you are going to move your piece on the line very good uhh bobby wait a minute
let me see who has not come up in the front row
angel you have not come up yet come on up that was nice of you bobby to point out who did not go so remember you are thinking negative right +3 hold on no wait a minute that is team one you are team 2 now so okay uhh who has not come up yet orion come on up hi
remember we are going to try and stay quiet and focus on the game so +one so what do you have to do yeah so wait a minute you are on -3 they are moving one so you are at -2 okay who has not come up on this side samantha why do not you come up
so give it a spin okay +2 she did spin it so you are going to move where no +2 very good considering i am the judge and you are one of the players you can not really make any sort of judgment so right now let us stop for a minute team 2 is at +5 right
where are they trying to get to negative not -10 so someone on this front team can you tell me how many spaces away are you from -10 right now
yes what then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers all right alicia did you come up yet yeah like 9 and you get like -10 and negative if you are at 9 and you get negative you would have to move back down
are you saying if you are at 9 and you get 33 then you just move up one and you have won you do not have to get exactly +one okay that was a good question miguel come on up let us see we are both kind of in the wrong place right now right team one is in the negative they want to be in the positive team 2 is in the positive they want to be in the negative table 4 orion you need to be paying attention the whole time
that is +2 +2 yeah hold on wait are we trying to get pluses yes you are trying to get pluses so move your wait a minute you are going to move the game board so you have -2 so you are going to go to 0 very good okay who has not come up yet on this noisha do you come up yet cassidy come on up
cassidy got 0 so we stay right where we are who has not come up in the back nathaniel come on up so remember nathaniel now is trying to think what +positive think positive do not think negative think positive got 0 so he is right where he is okay juzan come on up
uhh i hope everyone is listening 0 staying right where she is okay does everyone in the back come up anaya come on up let us see let us try to quiet down and focus
remember you need to be paying attention because you are going to be playing this game with a partner 0 all right justin come on up arnina and davina i know 0 and aaron ready so you are going to try and get a -3 very good you are at 5 so where are you going to go to very good so you are at 2 now
getting better davina come on up uhh 123 everyone needs to be listening -2 so you are at 0 so now where do you have to go hey
all right bobby come on up .
+0 okay very good alexander come on up excuse me i want you to move to that back seat right there for now so +2 come over here you have to move
hey kobe come on up he went up once now we are on everyone is 2nd turn so remember what number you are trying to get -one all right wait a minute kobe you are going to move the game piece very good okay 0 tire will be next all right alicia come on up
and aaron aaron you will be up next too remember alicia is team one so they are trying to get to +10 right -3 all right wait you got to move it alicia we got negative
okay we will play the game for a couple more minutes and then at that point if we have not gotten anywhere we will look to see who is closest to their goal and that team will be the winner all right +one not -one +one there you go hey aaron come on up table 5 you need to be paying attention so +3
wait a minute yes so you are at -3 where do you need to go to very good okay michael come on up can not move that yep +3 hold on you are going to move it uhh jasmine come on up
i like the way jasmine is sitting quietly i like the way some people are sitting up nathaniel and miguel your arms should be out of your shirts +2 go ahead very good okay nathan come on up when carrie got a +one he moved it forward instead of backwards
hold on come here he was supposed to move it forward he had +one yeah he had to move +one further over on the number line yeah but he moved it to the left no he moved it forward he did it at 1st and then he went back and fixed it bradley come on up
well but that is not your goal your goal is to get to -10 +3 good brad move it bradley you got to move it you are at 2 so where are you going to move to to the 5 very good hey rocco come on up come on rocco so +one come here
michael can you please not say that kind of stuff uhh and isaiah i do not need your help so it is unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally do not do that so you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson no matter what is going on in the classroom
segala come on up 0 that is okay okay noisha come on up
come over here you are going to move the game board that was 2 you had 712 okay it is almost 10 0 and at that time i wanted to start you playing partners so we have enough time for 2 more people to come up and spin so we need one for team one so anthony come on up yes and then tire you can be the 2nd one so +2
so you are at 5 where do you go very good angel i mean tire sorry sorry angel do not worry when you guys are playing with your partner you are going to keep going back and forth so you have lots of chances to spin -2
okay where were you just now 7 okay so we said we needed to stop the game here i need voices off and i need your eyes on the board we said we were stopping the game here now team one is at 7 and team 2 is at 8 so if you were just looking at this quickly you might assume that team 2 is the winner because they are closer to 10 why is team one the winner alexandra
cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side very good so team one is closer to their goal how far away is team one from their goal 3 how far is team 2 from their goal 18 so that is why team one this time the back group is the winner so does everyone understand how to play the game yes i think i think this game is rigged
do you think it is rigged well then that is something that wait a minute that is something you can investigate when you are working with your partner when you play the game with your partner you can take turns one of you will be team one the 1st time and team 2 the other partner will be team 2 and then you can switch so remember the things you are going to need you are going to need your game board you are going to need 3 paper clips you are going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place
obviously when you are playing you are going to have to hold the spinner for your the person you are playing with right since you are playing against each other what is the vocabulary term for that you are what competitive you are competing but you are what what do we call people who are playing against each other opponents that is right or foe yes another way you could say it is rival who just said that why would you do that
why so yes
yeah so you 2 can play together you 2 can play together anthony can you do me a favor can you pass out 3 paperclips to each pair quickly you 2 will play and you and .
are they up here yes no they are playing and they are playing
who will kobe will play with bobby you are going to be team one and kobe will be team 2 and then you will switch you are not worrying about the other people at the table so alexander you will play with segala
umm bradley anaya you are going to play with isaiah over at the back table come back here
your legs need to be under your desk please okay so let us check i want to see does everyone have the materials they need i am asking you to pay attention right now everyone has 3 paperclips yes
anthony go give them and everyone has a game board you know who you are playing with right where do you need to start your game pieces 00 where is team one is goal what is their goal +10 what is team 2 is goal i am asking you a question what is team 2 is goal -10 all right you can start to play
i am going to be around to watch what you are doing 0 bradley just reminded me what do you need to do on your number line some of you already did it label it very good do not forget to label your number line 0 you guys already did it great good jood
i see people using the negative numbers label your number line please do you remember to label your number line go ahead and label your number line
i did not do that correctly angel there is no reason to get that loud what is the problem bradley no we need another paper clip you have another one you need another one
they are on my desk make the minus ah very good what side is what
that one is really in half so i would spin again where is this supposed to be you are going to make sure and where is that one supposed to be one of the things i would be careful of put it on a flat surface and make sure you are keeping track of where things are supposed to be
go ahead
one of the things you might have to do when you are doing this is you might have to stand a little bit because if you keep jerking this around your paperclips are going to go everywhere right 0 no no no no you know anything you should do
go up to the where the elmo is get a small paperclip because this one is so big it is hitting your game is anybody winning yet aaron aaron very good whoa whoa whoa where were you
-3 nice you seem like 5 minutes
okay we are going to do that again
let me hold it for now you finished who won 3
so now you are going to switch segala will be team one and you will be team 2 so now instead of getting to +10 you are hoping to get to -10 yes when when i was with the spin orion accidentally put it up and it flanked okay so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior and i think i have said that more than once during this lesson you need to focus on what you are doing
yes then we switch right team if you were team one now you will be team 2 if you were team 2 now you will be team one how is it going
on the bottom okay fine yeah
this is our 2nd game your 2nd how many games have you played 3 who is won so far both times 0 you each won once when you are being +10 or -10 you were negative anyone yes good did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you are +10
but that shows that you can win when you are negative where are you you are moving in the wrong direction right now so how many places away are you from your goal 20 20 if you are a +10
what is this for i will show you in a 2nd i am going to wait you know you are with negative i am going to claim 2 minutes your place right now
no because right now on my side you are winning i do not like this i am at -0 my
okay 123 let us see who is listening i hear people talking and you should not be i handed you a piece of notebook paper what we are going to do i know some of you played 2 games some of you have played more games than that just leave it right there what i am going to ask you to do is you are going to go back to your seats in a minute you are going to write about playing the game i want you to tell me if you thought some of you thought the game
i heard somebody saying that you thought the game was unfair i want you to tell me why i want you to tell me what you think using the game how it helps you to learn about +and negative numbers what do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line what operation or operations okay and then if you think the game is unfair how would you fix it to make it fair okay so right now pick up your paper you can leave the game put the paperclips on the game board and leave it at that desk i will collect them in a minute
