what have we been talking about so far this week in math who can give me a couple of ideas of things we have discussed ben graphs okay we have been talking about graphs what kind of graphs have we explored this week chucky line graphs okay we have talked about line graphs celeste bar graphs bar graphs that has been most of our focus this week at a couple of other times we talked about some other things matthias pie graphs okay we have kind of talked about pie graphs noah double line graphs we talked about double line graphs
last one celeste
okay good we used tally marks to help us create those charts i like the fact that you remember that alright judging by what i have on the board what type of graph do you think we are going to be talking about today let us get some help from marcy
good we are going to be talking about a pie graph does anybody know another name for the pie graph anna circle graph circle graph why do you think we call it that max why do you think max why do you think we call it that because it is a circle that represents the amount of the sets okay good mainly because it is a circle okay so we have our circle graph it is on the board
what are some things you notice just by looking at it celeste give me one thing that you notice that half of it is colored blue good all of this side half of this is colored blue what is this graph about jaydon what do you think this graph is showing us it is books in the jaydon books books books what in the library books that are in the library so it is showing us these are all the books that are in the library
and it is showing us what parts are what different types of books so it is showing us 4 different types of books what is one type of book that it is showing us sandra non fiction okay it is showing us non fiction books chase fiction number one it is also showing us fiction books
okay should i put them here she is not in here right now thank you chase what other type of graph i mean i am sorry what other types of books is it showing us we got fiction non fiction history historical fiction good those are books that are historical tru i am sorry not true but they are based on things that still happened in history we are missing one other type stephanie what other type of book is up here
emily help us out we got historical fiction non fiction fiction and biographies biographies good i like the fact that emily is answering when i call on her alright so we have got 4 different things that are being shown here what is the book that we have the most of in the library you can probably tell this pretty quickly by looking at the graph what is the book that we have the most of in the library lisa
what doe we have the most of in the library fiction good how can you tell that so easily noah because it is it is half and all the others are not bigger than half good i like he said this is half the other is not as big as half but we can tell most of it is colored blue by looking at this graph pretty simply do we have any numbers up here yet no no but we can still tell andrew what do we have the least amount of green
historical fiction this green section here excellent job very good okay today we are going to work on making our own circle graph let me tell you how we are going to do this the 1st thing that we are going to do you are going to get a chart that looks like this and you are going to get an imaginary sorry guys it is imaginary
an imaginary $100 it has to be imaginary because i am not the richest person in the world and i do not have a $100 to give you if if i did i would alright so you have a decision to make you have to decide how you are going to spend your $100
if you had a budget of $100 for the month and you had to decide where you were going to spend this money you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it i am going to show you how i might spend it okay you are going to have some different categories that you can spend it in so you have you have some important choices to make 1st choice you have to decide how much money you are going to spend on food for the month what are some things that you might spend money on for food
just go ahead and give me a couple of quick examples alexis cakes i am going to call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands i appreciate that alexis go ahead food yeah what types of food might you buy bread okay you might buy bread celeste
milk olive garden okay you might treat yourself to olive garden martina junk food okay you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food good alright next category brussels sprouts next category just kidding we are going to talk about clothing now you get to decide if you we are going to wait you are going to decide how you are going to spend if how much money you want to spend on clothes
you might decide that you only want to spend $10 on clothes you might decide that you want you saw this jacket the other day and you really want to buy it and it is $70 you might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing we are also going to take a look at games what are some things .
raise your hand if you can tell me 11 type of game or one game example that you might be interested in
okay alexis grand theft auto okay naya
okay good hands down alright you are .
putting our hands down does not mean we shout out what answer we were going to give oh man you have also got movies if you are interested in either one of 2 things here hands down there is 2 different types of movies that i am thinking here one is if you wanted to go to the movies the 2nd one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the dvd of it so you have a couple different things to think about there then finally we have got toys
if there is a certain type of toy oh i left one off sorry books you c .
yeah you get to decide which area you are going to spend how much money so for example i am going to choose 3 different categories i am going to show you what i would do for my chart you are going to get to do this in just a moment but i am going to show you how i might decide to spend my money so at this point our pencils are still down our eyes are still up here i appreciate that entire 2nd row excellent job alright so expenses
i am going to decide that i am going to spend money on clothes and i am only going to choose 3 things you have to choose at least 3 categories but you can choose more if you want to i am also going to choose books and i am also going to choose fl food for my categories now the .
the 1st thing that i am going to do i am going to decide how much money i am going to spend on each area now how much money did i say that i had in all ben a 100 a 100 bucks alright i have a $100 in all to spend so i have to make sure that my total is going to equal $100 okay i can not spend just $50 total i have to make sure the whole thing is going to be $100 so for example gentlemen
i am going to spend i am going to go with $30 on clothes no let me go $40 on clothes
i am going to go with $40 on clothes i am going to go with $30 on books and i am going to go with .
$30 on food say what so the next thing naya brought up a good point it ha yes it has to equal a $100 so 40 and let me double check 40 and 30 is 7070 and 30 is 100 so i am good i do not have to use round numbers you could do $12 or $9 it is up to you as long as your total for your categories equals $100 next i am going to go to the following category what is your question
then do not be next category amounts spent out of $100 if you have to start it like that it is not going to be good okay okay dollars spent out of $100 alright so i am going to write a fraction this amount would be what how much out of 100 did i spend on clothes
i 40 how much $4040 out of 100 so my fraction is going to be 40 over 100 celeste help me out here books what would my fraction be for books celeste 30 out of a 100 excellent $30 out of $100 and the last one let me get some help from sandra how much am i spending on food as a fraction 30 over a 130 out of 130 over 100
now when we have talked about percentages all year long what did we say was always true about percentages they always had to be what max based out of a 100 based out of 100 well guess what we are lucky today with our fractions these are all out of 100 so this is going to be pretty easy i hope for us to convert to percentages jaydon what percentage of my money am i spending on clothes 4040% what percentage of my money am i spending on books daniel 30
30% and what percentage of my allowance or my budget am i spending on food matthias 30% 30% excellent job now after we have gotten our percentages i am going to have an opportunity to make my own circle graph now probably the hardest part about a circle graph is splitting it into the right number of sections
one of the papers that i have given you already has it you do not have to worry about it i am going to show it to you up here alright the circle graph that i am going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute not right now the circle graph that you are going to get already has 100 spots marked okay
so all i am going to do on my circle graph i have a 100 marks i need to color in 40 of those as clothes so let me give you kind of an idea of what you are going to do here i am just going to kind of i am going to start here for my clothing chucky eyes up here please eyes up here i am going to start here so 12345678910
did you just notice something about where that line is naya each like triangle equals 10 good each one of these big triangles is 10 but if i needed to do like 12 could i stop there yeah i can stop there and just draw a line but i did not do 12 so i am going to go 10203040 so .
this section is going to be 40% of my circle now just like on the graph we were looking at earlier this needs to be colored one color next i have books what should i probably do before i move on to books count it
before i move on to books what should i do emily label it ah and then great label it cause here is what is going to happen i am going to do books next and i am going to forget which one was clothes so i am just going to label this as clothes for right now and i can do one of 2 things i could either put $40 or i would put 40% and since it is a pie graph i think we should put 40% as our amount i am sorry you could put dollars that is showing the amount
but because we are doing a circle graph i think it is usually better to use percentages okay books i am going to do the same thing except that i am going to go 102030 so this section would be books books and what percentage would that be stephanie 3030% excellent job now am i going to color these the same color no no we are going to make sure that we have 2 different colors and then .
well 3 or 4 different colors depending on how many categories you are choosing then my last section would be food and i am going to label this as food and that would also be 30% there is one other thing that i want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute any ideas on what that might be what is one thing .
with my circle graph that i do not have right now celeste a title ah a title and i am not going to write it cause i would end up writing way up there on the wall but i would put my title what is a ti and of course you can be more creative with your title that i am probably going to be an example of a title i might have how i would spend my $100 can we change it out for the dollar sign yeah you could well you want to give us an idea .
the purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about if i titled it $100 it is a cute name like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody is interest but people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about chucky my budget okay my budget how i would spend my $100 naya my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot my $100 will be spent on dot dot dot celeste
i am just trying to double check do we have to use all of them okay okay excellent question you do not have to use all of these categories you have to choose at least 3 if you want to do every category you can but if you would rather ju let us say you know that you want to buy one book and that is only going to be $5 include it do $5 on a book okay but you have to choose at least 3 categories to purchase things in
chase do we have to put money in the categories cause i got clothes movies and food and i put 90 in clothes and 10 in food okay that is up to you we have not actually started yet i am going to put one other category up here and this is just to give you another option we are going to do a savings category if you would like to put some money aside to save for later you can always put it in the savings any other questions before we start today naya
like yours do we have to do that key ah excellent question naya asked a good question that i did not go over i love that do you need to do a key i would say yes it is going to be more clear if you have a key when you look at a graph in a book does it usually give you a key yeah excellent so when you have a graph you should pretty much always plan on including a a key any other questions before you get started all right before you flip your papers over and get started .
i do not mind if you are in a whisper but you need to be at your seats working on your graph if you do finish early if you finish before we are ready to stop i want you to turn your paper over and write 5 questions that can be answered from your graph if you do not have if you do not have colored pencils markers or crayons please borrow them from somebody around you not from somebody across the room
okay andrew
we are going wait and go to success maker about 1130 okay naya
you probably will not have time but we will see if you if you finish with all of it and your 5 questions raise your hand and let me know we will figure something out martinez why are you spending like $30 on food when i usually buy like cereal milk or bread i plan on treating myself to olive garden with naya so i figured it might cost me a little bit more
no goodness no alright any other questions before we start it is so cute cause any other questions before we start alright you may begin do we just put a circle with percent say that one more time
yeah that is fine right exactly you would not necessarily have to put what the name of it was it is optional see you at olive garden tomorrow
there you go some good sushi i am putting 90 in clothes cause i like clothes that is fine but you have to choose .
how many categories do you have to choose 3 okay choosing a category and putting in a 0 do you think that counts yes no
you do not you do not have to put a lot but you do need to have a 3rd category that has something in it i want to put 5
i want to color that one so hm i want to color this okay
no it has got to be somebody around you nope somebody close to you marcy is not close enough $40
huh
no borrow from somebody borrow from somebody
$20 okay okay
alright what do we got so far add them up for me 10 104078 9100 excellent ooh i have $34 left
i got $0 left excellent you can go ahead and start coloring if you are ready hm what there you go emily is going to help you out there i am done alright cool so let us add them up and make sure 30 50 so do your pie graph 40 .
so 90 so 5090 and hey does not this picture look a little bit like pacman attacking pacman harper you are ready no you are fine i am i am just visually looking at what you are doing to make sure we are on the right math let me get the types 1st perfect you may start coloring i can put ¢24 into movies right how many movies you want yes
yep that works you are exactly right 4627 and you are going to give us that tough math let us see 406666 and 24 would be ooh wait hold on let us see 46 what is this supposed to be it is someone else we could do with the circle
7 and 24 double check it i think we are about 3 off does this have to be neat or can i leave it like that i would like for it to be neat i would like to always see your best work which is usually your neatest work
i can not find my mistake what mistake i did the wrong chart that is supposed to be this is supposed to be at 30% i do not have nothing else that is 20% well i will put something at 20% no that was my games oh i can change this yeah i would change something to make it so yeah okay i think that would work
good idea
he said i eat nasty food that is wrong he is jealous cause he does not know high quality food what w we understand martinez alright 6075 perfect all right you have got all your percents in you are ready to get started what are we doing he changed the line no
do something else that is we can not do that you are going to make a mess all over the place does that one work that will work
let us see chucky
i i am going to color the happy face okay you can also decorate around the edges yay that would be marvelous i like them both so no which is the .
if you are happy if you are happy me and my brother eat it if i am in a happy mood yeah if i am in a happy mood i am going to go with chili lobster awesome miss name can you take me to olive garden can i take you to olive garden yeah like right now i wish i could that would be nice
i do not like olive garden alright now can i call time out for a 2nd are these are going to be the same blue alright that is going to throw me off let me go get you another one okay cause i messed up would that be okay okay it is next to the sushi spot yeah oh yeah
thank you you are welcome what you are welcome alright how are we doing bad actually 40102030 beautiful i am coming there next anna alright so you got you have clothes is here
let us see so 10203045 perfect books are where are books okay books are 5 food is 20 movies are where 10 and games are 10 why did we end up with .
an open spot alright let me see you pencil i am not seeing it okay so from here 10203045 okay all of that is clothes right yeah okay and then we have got books books
let us do books here for this 5 then we have food which is 20 up to there so we have from here to here so far right so we have 102030 and you have 30 left that is perfect okay so games is 20 ah i see the games was only at 15 that is why we were missing that 5
alright if we put books here games is how much 2020 so do games from here to here and then movies in there that will work out that is where that extra 5 that is where we were missing it from that makes sense let me check come on yeah she was going to be drowned
huh
okay we are going to go to lunch soon okay if you feel sick let me know okay especially if you need the restroom alright let us see the only thing i would recommend andrew andrew
alright what i would probably do because these are kind of hard to read i would probably have put these off to the side so that they would be easier to read cause you are going to see that done that way a lot on graphs okay very nice alright you okay take a breath do not you have her paper for the you said you what
she said she is a yeah oh that is on i was just i was just wanting to what you did wrong what would you mess up on i said it is okay but she is not it looks like 2 it looks like 10
yeah we have an extra one you can use that one that is fine can i get water okay you just got water 5 questions about your graph he got a he got to make a make a key yep you need a key and you need a .
how do you got to make a key title key and title please oh like that oh what did you mess up on
okay let us let us do this start here and go around okay go ahead
let me see what you do we will make sure you get it right alright so we have got 20 for the food
okay and then 30 for games good keep going movies is 5 so that is going to be to where here yep very good now make me a key down at the bottom so i know what each color represents please missus missus .
let us get stephanie to help you
is not that food the green one let us see what we are doing alright keep going alright so then you have what
and 2020 okay now hold on because here is what you are going to need here is where here is where i think we are getting confused you got to do this 5 huh and then this 10 is going to bring us to what
up to then to here is going to be .
so that is going to be your 20 it is just not going to be it is just not going to end on a whole line this way it is going to end ther perfect okay and then .
alright and then we have what is next toys for 10 thank you again right here you are welcome perfect and then what do you have left savings my voice sounds fun funny savings which is 15 beautiful that is exactly right is this okay miss name i kind went outside the lines
on purpose say that again you know how the sentences that have more than like to subtract what is the difference between the amount of money i would spend on this and the amount of money i would spend on that what is the difference use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea
what now
time out purple yellow orange alright so you got 2 more keep going yes can i go to miss name today i am going to go get some bread for me
no clap clap clap alright i am going to give you about 5 more minutes to finish up what you can what you do not finish in class we will finish for homework but take the next few minutes get as far as you can so that i can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home this are savings this to food i was supposed to do 20 on the games but then i messed up
but then i did fine alright 506070809100 did you just add savings yeah oh okay that is cool it just threw me off i was like wait a 2nd how did we do that okay i follow you we are good okay so you have 10 for savings 10 for movies movies 10 for games 5 for books and then 40 twen 1020304045 for clothes and 20 for food perfect
that works hold on hold on i am just right here alright so you definitely have a large clothing budget i will need a bigger closet yes okay that will be in your next budget alright here is what i want you to do next excellent job turn it over i want you to ask 5 questions that somebody could answer from your graph okay can i put he loves clothes could they ans .
they actually might be able to answer that from your graph but yeah 5 questions based on your graph
alright let me take a look at it
excellent now flip it over i want you to come up with 5 question that somebody could answer by using your graph okay beautiful i know right like it alright what is the sum of all the data okay good what does the green part of the graph mean what is the .
one moment please what is the least percent how much okay good now would you be able to answer those questions alright go ahead and answer those questions we should be wrapping it up in just a moment is it okay if if i put the questions on here that is fine
yep i see 2 things i am missing what just just one okay so i am missing your title and what else just that what else just that how about .
show me a key
alright so you need a a title and a .
i am finished mar marcy is giving you a hint key and you got 5 questions alright let us take a look yeah you got to write 5 questions do you have any white out no that is okay just put one line through it and then write the word again there you go make sure your name is on it we are just about finished
yes you may
ooh say that again
that is okay there is a .
can i get another sheet of paper no just do it on the back this one is fine i messed it up it is fine no it is fine do it how much more money did i spend on food than clothes but can i say 1st the movies you could say how much more money did i spent on food than clothes and movies altogether nah okay can not i put my fun chart
very colorful it is bright colors jaydon jaydon yes andrea is not in here i can not talk to her yet okay i will talk to her when she gets in here alright 54321
0 go ahead and put your markers crayons down stop where you are at thank you ben thank you max excellent job andrew everything down ready to listen again alright we are going to do one last thing before we leave for success maker i want us to take a look back at our graph
now that we have had a chance to color our own graphs let us try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph who wants to start us off i think there is probably one that is easier than the rest of them that is just my opinion martinez what do you think i think the the blue one is 50 alright why do you think the blue s ladies
why do you think the blue section is 50% cause it is it is half of that okay excellent job it is half we know that 50% and half are the exact same thing so we are going to go ahead and label this section 50% i think that is an excellent estimate andrew do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us the orange one is 25 okay what makes you think the orange one is 25%
say that one more time 4 of those equals 100 excellent job so basically what andrew is saying is that this section is like 14th of the circle and 14th of the circle would be 25% excellent job i would agree with that so how much have i used up so far 75% i have used up 75% so i only have 25% left naya what section do you want to label for us the biographies
biographies is the yellow section what do you think i think it is like small 15 okay yeah 15 because cause b the green and the yellow is 25 so if you take off like a little bit of it .
you are on the right track you are saying it exactly right it is just kind of hard to explain i think what you are i what i am hearing you say is that this section will be 25% so we have to decide if this section is 25% this would have to be like 15 or 20 and this would have to be like 5 or 10 okay what martinez give us what you think it would be i think it is 15 because if you add the green one and the yellow one it equals the same as 25
so half of this is will be 25 too okay so half of 25 is 15 i have got to say i agree with you all is reasoning i think that this is somewhere between 15 and 20% and this is somewhere between 5 and 10% so let us say 15% and 10% now double check let us make sure that we have 100% before we move on 50 and 25 would be 7575 and 10 would be 8585
85 and 15 a 180 a 100 a 100% excellent job alright any questions before we move on naya i know it is an estimate but at 1st i was at least thinking that the green part was 5 okay at 1st glance i am kind of leaning between 5 and 10% and naya brought up a good point this is an estimate okay now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount but for our purposes this is an estimate i am glad that you brought that up again ben
right because it is an estimate if we had done 20% here and 5% here that would also have given us the 25% the most important thing i want you to take from looking at this would we ever said this amount was 45% no no it is not anywhere near half of the circle so that is what i want us to be keeping in mind while we are doing and making our own circle graphs alright excellent job today if you did not finish we will finish it for homework i am going to call groups to line up for success maker
let me get table 5 go ahead and line up
