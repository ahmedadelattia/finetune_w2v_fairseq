alright so on your desks you have your multiplication cluster problem that you worked on this weekend for homework right and we started this on friday i gave you a little introduction we did set a together and i think you got to work on set b is that true
before we left class on friday okay who can talk to us about what multiplication cluster problems are what are these problems what is it all about what is the purpose of multiplication cluster problems so when i look at each set i see several problems and then a final so i see like 3 or 4 problems and a final problem
what is the purpose of the cluster problems caroline
to help you to know the product of the final one does that add to what caroline said so she thinks that they have something to do with the final multiplication problem in the list leslie do you want to add to that the problem is that they gave you you have to choose 2 of them to help you with the final problem
and did you find them to be helpful when you were solving them this weekend so was there something from the list that you could choose to help you solve the final problem at the bottom raise your hand if you felt like there were some helpful ones in the list okay so you are given kind of a big challenging problem at the bottom of the list and those those related problem sets those clusters are the those clusters are there to help you break down the bigger problem
okay and in past experience nancy we have had to create our own problems right we have had to make arrays and break those larger problems down on our own and be creative and think about how to do that but in this case you do not necessarily have to be as creative to even give us a list of problems to choose from
so that was pretty helpful was not it okay so we did set a together but i want to show you an example of something that you will be working on this morning you are going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner so here is my example i have chosen set a since we already solved a together on friday so what you are going to do is here is your list of directions
i am going to give you and a partner a split and on that split is one of the sets on your sheet the only one that is not represented is a because i am doing a for you so i took a out of the possibilities so you might get set b c all the way to f you do not know which set you are going to get that is why i asked you to be prepared over the weekend and come in with them all finished already you are just going to add a little bit of some work to that today okay
so with the split a set that i give you you are going to solve each of the small more manageable problems in the cluster which you already have if you did all your homework so all you have to do is rewrite them on a slip of paper so you solve all the smaller ones okay then you are going to decide upon one or 2 problems to use to help you solve the final more challenging problem one or 2 okay
you might choose one and then have to add something from your own thinking or there might be 2 in the list that will help you get right to the product of the final problem i keep using the word product can somebody remind me what the word product means anna
yes so the answer to a multiplication helps you solve a product okay i really hope you understand that so solve each of the small problems decide which ones that will help you to get the answer of the large one then this is new you are going to draw an open array that matches what you chose
so whatever problems you chose to help you solve the final problem you are going to draw an array open array to help you visualize what this problem breaks down to look like okay what is an open array nancy
it does not have all the square units
so with the open array you do not have to do that right michelle yes so here is an example of what this will look like after you draw your open array we are going to write a short little description of how you solved the final problem and why you used the problems that you used so what were you thinking about when you chose each of the problems how did you come to the side on those particular problems
because mario you might work with chris and each of you are going to have the same set but you might want to use 2 problems and chris might want to use another 2 problems because he thinks about math in a different way he is making sense of breaking down the problems a little bit different is that okay to do is that okay yeah so if you are working with a partner on the same set is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem
yeah what do you think brian yeah do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses no no you with me pay attention pay attention who can answer my question who me why because the 4 of us may think a different way
so even though you have the support of your partner and you can work together and help each other carlos you might decide that you want to use the 1st 2 problems and edna if you happen to be with him you might decide you want to use the 3rd problem but make up your own 2nd problem that is perfectly fine you are just there to support each other you do not have to do the exact same work because you each have your own way of thinking about things and you each already thought about them for homework anyway so it is up to you how you come to that conclusion of what to use
solving each one deciding on which problems to use open array short description of your thinking why you did what you did and how you got to the final answer okay and then you are going to put it all together on a little sheet that looks something like this
similar yes exactly so you are going to glue on the slip that i gave you do the solving this is where you write your little explanation and your open array can go down here if you mix it up a little bit and it does not all go in the same exact spot that is fine with me as long as you have those components the answers to the small problems the description of how you solved it and why you did it that way and your open array with the dimensions what are the dimensions of an open array what do i mean by that
yes post what
so the number that goes on the side of the array and the number that would go on the top of the array right and one of those numbers will most likely be broken apart into smaller pieces okay so this is the small version to show you what yours will look like and then i just made kind of a gigantic version so you could see so i did set a 4 x 10 is 40 4 x 40 is 160 4 x 3 is 12 and 2 x 43 is 86
the final problem is 4 x 43 so what made sense for me when i was figuring out what to use to solve this was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 is it the only way i could have done it no but it was my 1st thought it was the 1st thought i had and the reason for that is i know that 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 gives me 4 x 43 because i took the 43 and i broke it into 2 smaller parts
i broke it into a 40 and a 43 right so this number sentence right here represents 40 groups of 4 which is this one +3 more groups of 4 which is this one gives me a total of 43 groups of 4 all i have to do is what add the what chris what is that word with the p
the products right i have to add the products from each of these and it gives me the product for the final one so i did not really have to do any extra work did i so that made sense for me are there other ways i could have solved it certainly but i only have to solve it in one way for this purpose madam yes on our paper do you have something that you can show why we use those to like get out of here
yes please i would like for you to describe it as carefully as possible and put your thoughts down why would you trade each other what are you going to like write on the paper what did you all learn in your notebook 1st once you have it all clear your arrays will be in your notebook right your big open array will be in your notebook the explanation will be in your notebook i will check it over and then i will give you the final poster paper no but i am talking about like you picked those 2 right
yes do we have to show on the paper like the bad and the fine posts and whatever yes and as you can see on this small paper i wrote explain your thinking in words and numbers so however you added it together whatever you multiplied explain why you did it that way and show your mathematical thinking does that answer your question yes okay any other are there any other questions no brandon
it looks like like that we are making progress yeah it is a little bit and you will have a final project and we may or may not finish this today we got started a little bit late with the camera issue but if we do not finish it today we will finish it up tomorrow but you should be able to get a significant amount of work done on it today okay and are there any questions no okay so i am picking partners when i pick your partners i want you to come to me and i am going to give you each a slip
there is no gluing there is no final product until these are solved and the work is in your notebook when all of that is finished and you have checked it all over and you are sure that it represents what you want it to say or to be then you can have it checked with me and i will just be walking around and helping you out you might end up sitting at other people is desks and that is fine with me just please be thoughtful of their belongings do not touch things that do not belong to you
but we are going to be working at desks so whatever partner you get with you need to find a desk to work at you can not work on the same desk okay clear and like i always say your partner is your partner for now you are not getting married so it does not matter who you are working with use them in the best ability that you have right
you are sharing ideas okay so let us start with leslie and brian come on up get your slips one for each of you work together to solve a smaller part okay arlene and beth arlene em and beth beth
no you have the same problem
so you can work on solving the smaller ones together but when it comes to how you are going to tackle that final one it will be a personal choice okay eamon and abraham stephanie stephanie no no stephanie
cessia and rayna aider is aider here no he is not here aider 0 i hope sickness has not struck david and michelle no
allison and edna nancy and josue alvin and edna catherine and mario
and christopher and arlene s and caroline and carlos you have 2 students absent and you are still even which is good carlos and caroline no all right so are we settled
and how are you working together i just want to get the answers all right so how are you working together okay so is 50 10 x 5
so the 50 is 10 x 5 so will this answer be 10 x 5 so how about 10 x 30
right okay so will this answer be 10 x this product so how will i get that product think about it i will be back back up a little bit
i do not know where you are with this okay so you chose in order to solve 70 x 5 you chose this
so this is 5 +7 +7 equals 9 right and here i have 76 which is one so after you choose this one you choose this one this one right yes so 71
all right so right here so the other problem is 70 x 5 right how is 70 x 5 related to this you already know the answer to 70 x 5 it is 80 x this okay and then what is the difference between these 2 problems
this is 70 x 5 and this is 5 +7 so how many more groups of 5 is this and then you change the number so if you do 70 x 5 you get this
and if you do 6 more x 5 you get this all right that is it and you have to do it this way
all right you are going to do it this way okay all right
and how are you sure that you have the answer brian who is your partner okay we are going to do it together we are going to do it together so that you are communicating better have you heard anything about these problems are you alive tonight you are awake all right so let us begin let us move over here to the right we will not hurt you okay
it is not going to be hard anymore and so did you figure out the answers to your small problem yet
so this is 15
what makes sense for you 58 x 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 7 58 x 2 how does 58 x 2 relate to 58 x 6
this is 2 groups of 58 right how many groups of 58 are there 2
you have no problem talking all right now i am trying to help you see the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 how many x do i have to make this array to match this problem do you guys agree with me on this 3 x 3 x total or 3 more x
why and i only have 2 here but there is 6 so there is 6 here if i were to make this 3 more x what do i do to all these to get to the answer
so what i asked originally was what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6 it just happened about how i need 2 more of those so i would say this is only 2 more x that would mean that i have 4 of them with all of them amy what would you do with these 3 problems
i agree why would you add them all i agree with you yeah i agree with you
each one is just too big to carry right
so why would you add them all
6 how many units 6 so i add all of the unit 116 how many units of 58 do i have 8 units 8 units
exactly how you described it to me orally is what you want to write do you have another nice thing you want to use this time okay we will do that all right so talk to me so you need to put your own symbol on the list
so 50 x okay so you start with what is on the list and then you decide to make your own problem which is 8 x 6
okay i like that you did that and that this is definitely going to get you to the answer which is 8 x 6
however there is a multiplication here and so it is going to affect your result what is 8 x 6 what is it 58 x 4 are you going to use your partner can you use karla to support you karla can you help caroline she is going to help you
and this question asks you why you decided to go with a rate of one and you chose 17 x 5 to begin with and you chose 17 x 6 x 10 so you each come here for 7 points and you each can read about the problem in the 1st grade and you can explain that in writing and the words and the numbers and you learn a little bit about it okay you will learn
did you check your notebook your homework notebook see what you had to do okay well let me tell you what this means for you this means that you are a little bit behind because this work involving you has been done now you are going to start from scratch you are working on this idea you need to go through these problems and decide what is going to help you with this problem
can you do that pause it please excuse me how is it going over here michelle which set did you get b okay b yes okay and did you work together to solve the smaller problems yes
yes
okay let us back up a little bit let me ask you this what is the relationship between 58 x 2 and 58 x 6
3246 how many 2s are in 53 so how many times would you have to do 58 x 2 to get to 58 x 33 and let us maybe we can draw an array and see if that works out so 58 x 2
56 x 2 i am going to draw a really long or wide rectangle
and so i broke it is like breaking that large problem into how many different parts 3 parts right and this ends up being the total of 6 over here
this is the equation 58 x 2 +58 x 2 equals the same as 58 x 6 so each of these multiplication problems in parentheses represent one sector of the array
so when you were trying to do 58 x 4 it was a 2 array and i think what we found out was that this was the addition part so we can do it that way all right so you and chris which sector did you choose
6
have a seat and i will come to you okay have a seat and i will come to you
how did you make sure that you had no tracking error in your strategies
how did you make sure that you were not making any mistakes
in about 2 minutes or so we are going to stop and do a debrief we are going to talk about some strategies that you and your partner used
and caroline i would like you to add 4 to 16 did you each get the same answer of 248 and did you solve it the same way
i chose is this 15 or 58 caroline this 50 x 6 is different than what you were doing here you chose 58 x 2 earlier 58 x 2
this is what all this work represents 58 x 2 your array is here your equation is here your addition is here and then why did you start talking about a different problem there is it just a mistake what should this problem say is it 50 x 6 that you used or 50 x 2 that you used 50 x 2 is what you used
you could have used 50 x 6 but you did not did you and just re read your explanation to make sure it is exactly what you wanted to say
well please start writing to me
so i will put this right here and that is okay for in your notebook
the whole thing is 10
and this would be a 4 in your array and this thing you can represent this array the same way horizontally
you have you have a tricky time with that use of the word double what is double i think it means you double this then you add it here what did you double
okay caroline and as soon as you can help him with that i will give you the sheet of paper that is what we are waiting for time to go so 58 x 2 because i got the half of 6 and separated it into 3 pieces of 2
thirds really right thirds you took 6 and you split it
i chose and and solved that problem 3 x because 2 is 13rd of 6 instead of half you can still talk about fractions if you want to but 2 is not half
so you talk to me about it somebody chose 58 x 2 and what did you do with it and i how many x did you do 58 x 2
2 is 13rd of of 62 is 13rd of 62 +2 +2 is 6 and your major your major long line of equations is right here this represents your here is your picture here is your equation it is complicated it is it you know what it is very complicated that is why we have lots of possibilities for what you said
it is complex is this on time or no time a couple minutes a couple minutes i want to pause you and i do want to have a couple minutes of a debrief is there any could i have one group one partnership that is close to being finished to come up and kind of talk about what they did we can have 2 groups if we have time arlene you sort of raised your hand
i know you are not fully done with your poster and that is fine but could you could you still come up could you still come up here and talk about it you can pick one of your ways if you want you do not i know you went all out and did 2 strategies but if you want to just pick one way you can do that you want to could you do that okay come on up who will tell us what set you were working on hold on everybody else is pausing
please caroline sit down all the way on the bottom i was working on set c okay what was the final problem you were going to solve 32 x a okay was there were there any other partners working on set c no okay so listen carefully think about whether you did it similarly differently or or what
i used 32 x a okay so the main problem is 32 x a and you did 30 x a okay and why did you do that because i needed to add a to what how many quarters of a do you need
you did 30 you did 30 x a how many more quarters of a do you need for 32 x a all right all eyes up here let us tell barbie so your major problem is your final difficult problem is 32 x a okay right
and you did 30 x a 30 x a what else would arlene need to do she did 30 groups of a how many groups of a does she need to have 32 so how many more groups of of a do you need 2 more groups of a right you still have to multiply this 2 by the a
you did the 30 x the a but you have to multiply all the parts of this number by this number so i still need the 2 x a so you have this answer right which is what 240
and so how many more or how much more do you have to add with 2 x 8 15 yes did you say 16 i might have misheard you so what happens when you combine 30 groups of a +2 groups of a
what do you get as a total 256 very good very good thank you one more one more partnership caroline do you want to come up i think you can do it
you did a lot of work over there come on up you have no problem speaking up right okay what was your set set b okay set b which is what but what is the final problem carlos what is the final problem in set b what 58 58 x 6 who else did set b
any other partners adrian are you paying attention are you paying attention it does not look like it can you show me that thank you all right 58 x 6 what did you do i broke it into i broke it into 6 the 6 yeah so caroline took the and caroline and carlos took the 6 and they broke it into 32s
246 and then so what was 58 x 2116116 and you had to do that how many times and we talked about a fraction because we are having some people are having a hard time with the word doubling doubling means multiplying something by 2 right
but doubling is not the word we always use when it comes to multiplication it depends on what you are doing so 2 is not half of 6 right 6 is not 22 so these 2s are what fraction of 6 caroline 13rd 2 is 13rd of 6 that is why you have to do it 3 x does that make sense okay usually we take the big problem and we make 2 smaller problems
but with caroline she made it made more sense to her to do 3 problems because she used the 58 x 2 and what did you get as your answer so all these groups of 2 add up to the 6 and the 58 for a total of 30348 who else did group set b
and abraham and aiden what did you get 348 is your answer all right so we are going to pause on that i know that none of you know their poster who did not even get to start their poster today me okay we are going to this is a 2 session project anyway so we will finish this up tomorrow go ahead and put that work that you are going to do over there please may i show the finished work okay
