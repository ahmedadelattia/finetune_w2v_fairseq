all right everyone should have their mountain math sheets out where is your mountain math sheet
you do not have one you were in here yesterday morning when we went over the things on the board correct so you should have had one of these do you remember what you did with it
soleil just sit in your seat sweetheart sit in your seat all right so mountain math this week yesterday we had an opportunity to go over number one
and i am glad we did because we got an opportunity to look at partial product again yesterday and i got a chance to see that some of you guys still need that review so very good we also looked at number 2 yesterday and we talked about the 2 systems of measurement that we use
what are those 2 systems called customary and metric customary and metric system pints would fall under which system can anybody tell me pints would fall under which system what is the system that we primarily use here in the states customary system very very good now the question there says which item would most likely have this weight or capacity
when we are trying to figure out when you hear pint are you thinking about weight or are you thinking about capacity
capacity which is how much a seat can hold which is measured in cups pints quarts ounces gallons very very good a little out of order but should be good it is not how much it is how much it can hold but what is it holding when you are talking about capacity what is it holding
liquid liquid very very good now let us look at number 3 number 3 is a review of place value and what we are trying to do quick review you are trying to see or you are going to tell me the number 2 or the digit 2 in each one of these numbers you are going to tell me the place value so read the 1st number for me mackenzie
124784531 531 very good the 2 is in which place which place i know it do not give me the value of it tell me which place it is in what did you say
tell me what you said what is the place value meaning which place is it in is it in the ones place is it in the 10s place is it in the 100s place it is in the 10s place say it loud it is in the 10000000s it is in the 10000000s place now knowing that it is in the 10000000s place what is the value of that 2
20000000 20000000 you just have to be confident i heard you say it the 1st time you just have to speak up okay all right what about the next number morris read the next number for me the next number is go back there if you have to 314728 314728
what is the place value of the 210s place it is in the 10s place now that 2 being in the 10s place what is the value of that 2 20 units say that again 20 units 20 units or 2210s 20 very very good the next number casey
682986 682986 what is the place value of the 2000s 1000s place what is the value of that 2 in the 1000s place 2000 very good chris do the last number for me 2734879 say it again 2734879
very good you just left out the 1000 the 1st time okay what is the place value of the 2000000s it is in the 1000000s place the 2 being in the 1000000s place what is the value of that 24000000 excellent job put your mountain math away and get out your calendar math
as soon as you get over there plop down get started
you are going to run no you are going to run me over elijah
you are right here but if he wants to he can okay it is not a problem yes sir i i put it to start calendar today you want to start calendar today okay back here ladies come on did you do calendar at your old school no
did you do calendar at your old school no all right come on back here i do not have time for this soleil sweetie you do not i do not have time for this okay so what you are going to have to do is get a sheet of notebook paper and come on back because you got to put your papers where they belong
we have to get you organized you got to be able to transition here you go leave your chair sweetheart you can sit on the floor monsey make sure you can see what is going on so turn around
all right adam spoke up today and adam said ms lee i want to get us started with calendar today okay i am going to give you a 2nd hold on shh
i am giving you guys a 2nd here soleil all right i am going to go ahead and let adam get us started all right talk to me adam
the fraction to decibels the fraction could be 109 over 180 the fraction could be what 109 over 180 does this model 109 over 180 do we have 180 total pieces here i got 200 units
you could you are going to have to end up having 200 units okay but if you look at this let us put it in the form of a mixed number 1st what would the mixed number be it would be one and 9 hundredths it would be one and 9 hundredths
okay one and 9 hundredths how would you convert this mixed number to an improper fraction you have a whole here 9 hundredths this supports this you would divide it hold on
give him a chance you would add 100 to 9 you would add 100 to 9 and it leaves the denominator the same okay what you would end up doing is you would do 100 times the one you get 100 +9 will give you what 109
109 and he said you leave your denominator the same you leave your denominator the same can you also do 0 no you can not can i also do what one times 9 equals 100 i mean one times 9 equals 9 +100 and one times 100 we do not want to go backwards just go the way the operation tells you to go because you will not always have a one as your whole number
okay alright nor will you always have 100 as your denominator okay alright now is there another way that you could write this one and 9 hundredths priyasi you want to come up here and show me and you can write it equally on your side there
very very good one and 9 hundredths what does this look like when you see that what do you think of yes you see a decimal yes you are right what else
say that again he says he thinks of a one.09 how many pennies does it take to make a dollar 100 so knowing that this can also be thought of as one.09 what is the place value of the 9
what is the value of the 9 if there are 100 pennies in a dollar what is the place value of the 9 joshua hundredths it is in the hundredths place very very good today is the 30th day of school
not the 30th day of school but it is the 30th day of january i did the same thing yesterday ms lee ms lee ms lee ms lee classify that number for me okay so 1st she said it was even how do we know when a number is even how do we know when a number is even davis
can you look in the ones place if it is 0 2 4 6 8 okay yeah very very good equal groups can go into it it can be split into 2 equal groups very very good now shiela what else do you have if it can be divided by 2 if it can be divided by 2 if it can be divided by 2
in division you have your dividend 30 divided by 2 your dividend is your total number of items correct mackenzie your divisor is your total number of groups so that supports what we just said with rex we can split it evenly into 2 what groups groups perfect but you just said it a different way very good now she also said that 30 was composite
who can provide me evidence to support 30 being composite well let me backtrack a little bit what is a composite number what is a composite number joshua
what is a composite number monty a composite number is a number that has 3 or more factors a number that has 3 or more put it in my hand 3 or more factors very very good
now who can list the factors for 30 for me on the board up there me
what else can you tell me up here which fraction is not not in simplest form ms lee 3 which one is not in simplest form 3 put your hands down for a 2nd i have a quick question
you know how i am always telling you guys when you are doing problem solving and you are reading problems you got to make sure you understand the vocabulary 1st what does this mean for a fraction to be in its simplest form i know ms lee i know i know what does that mean chris
hold on just a 2nd say that again
the only factors they have in common are one very good the greatest common factors that they have in common are what one or is what 11 very very good so the question asks which fraction is not in its simplest form
and you got to tell me how you know ms lee elijah 9 twelfths he says 9 twelfths is not in its simplest form because if you could divide it by 3 i would give you 3 fourths excellent excellent job
he gave me an answer he gave me evidence to support his answer i did not have to ask you again hit the bucket alright josh morris i noticed a pattern on the calendar okay what pattern do you notice they are all the same fractions they are just rotated around they are all the same fractions but they are just rotating and we saw this at the beginning of the month
how you have a 12th a 4th a 3rd then a half and it repeats itself a 12th a 4th a 3rd and a half very very good all right but you are just saying that it rotates it is like the shaded area is rotating around the circle which direction is it going in
and when i say direction is it going clockwise or is it going counterclockwise ms lee casey you look at a clock
is it going do your hands go this way to the right or do they go to the left come on ms lee yeah it is going tuesday and then look at saturday and it is going that way look here if you go from tuesday to wednesday 0 yeah i thought you meant like the same fractions
no but wait a minute you may have discovered something else what do you mean when you say the same fractions come up here and show me because i say it is going clockwise all right i see the pattern is going clockwise how about you davis
okay so show me what you see like that one is right there and so then that one is moving counterclockwise and then this one is also moving counterclockwise okay here to here to here okay so what you were looking at is the same fractions from one let us write those numbers down
one 5 9 13 17 21 25 and 29 guess what i would have to agree with you and maybe the way i said it confused you guys but if you are looking at the same fraction if you are looking at a 12th here and a 12th here and a 12th here it does look like it is going counterclockwise
but what i was talking about is i was saying if you are going from a 12th to a 4th from a 4th to a 3rd from a 3rd to a 12th i am sorry to a half but guess what it is just based on what you see so very very good and thank you for explaining that you put up a column between 5 and 9 okay there we go
0 look at the numbers that we put up here wait a minute wait wait wait these are all of your numbers and i think i left off i got them all up there all of your numbers that have a 12th shaded in what could you say about all of those numbers what do they have in common they are all odd numbers
what does it mean for a number to be odd what does it mean for a number to be odd tyrese
when you can not give wait an odd number if there is a one in the ones place a 131357 or 9 in the ones place then it is an odd number
a 13579 i agree what is another way i think because most odd numbers they can not be divided divided by what by even numbers
i mean into even groups well 25 can not so can 21 so can 21 so can 9 most odd numbers no help him out because he is on the right track but help him out it does not have like a multiple or something like i can not do it
0 yeah i do not know chris it can not be divided by 2 it can not be divided by 2 remember when we showed here your divisor what you are dividing by tyrese your divisor when it is 2
if you have an odd number 2 will not the number that you have 25 cannot be split evenly into 2 groups meaning if this is missus lee and tyrese and we are trying to share 25 chocolate chip cookies guess what i am probably going to get a little bit more than you simply because each of you gets 12.5
i will not split the half i will probably just take a whole you all already know that but evenly but you know what you can say 12.5 but that half is that half a whole number no no no it is not so that is why this would not be considered an even number very good very good now i am going to say one more
everybody to your seat and we are going to look at what ife did put your clipboards back hold on hold on go to your bathroom sweetie and wash your hands no do not touch anything come on clipboards back aziz
he just sneezed aziz sneezed in 321 okay ife came up here and we were classifying the number 30 and someone said that 30 was a composite number so ife tell us what you did
i did the multiple i mean the factors for 30 and what equals 30 if you multiply those 2 factors together and then i listed the factors very good let us see what she did here all right now we want to make sure that we try to always list the factors in order correct
so that we do not get mixed up and we do not leave anything out so put your hands down for a 2nd so she started off good right here one times 30 okay she did one times 30 but we determined that 30 was an even number so if you know that 30 is an even number you know that 30 can be divided evenly into 2 groups
so pretty much what i just said is that 30 divided by 2 gives you a number without a remainder or your quotient without a remainder so what number or what 2 factors should i have right here please ms lee give us some time
30 split into 2 groups how many will be in each group 5 well if i put 5 in each group you all remember how to do partial quotient yeah ms lee all right if i have partial quotient . yes
help me out here you can go ahead and put 5 and you say 5 times 2 will give you what 1010 how many do i have left 20 then you do 0 okay then what 0 i still have 20 20 of that 20 ife how many can i put in each group you can put 10 in each group
okay so i would say 10 times 2 would give me 20 you said times okay so what goes here 20 i subtract and i get 0 i add up these numbers here and what do i get 1515 my quotient is 15
very good i was standing up here trying to remember how we organized it i forgot but 5 10 1515 is our partial quotient all right wait a minute we have not gotten there yet so i can not believe we are still doing this that was a good review right there though okay so we have 2 times 15 3 times 10 okay can 4 go into 30 evenly
4 times 7 28 4 times 8 nope 5 yes 6 this is just inverse very good what property is that representing commutes to property what else 7 can 7 go into it evenly no 8 no 9 no wait what yes
9 no no 10 she already had that one this is just the inverse of that so she has one there should be a 2 here 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 so what she was missing over here you had your 30 over here sweetheart you were just missing your 2 and your 15 okay so very very good hit the bucket and you did a good job explaining yourself all right
hit the bucket get out your homework from last night on yesterday how do we add and subtract mixed numbers this is a review okay it is a review put your hand down for a 2nd 0 this is a review or it was a review
and what i want you all to do without saying anything i just want you to check your answers right now that is what i want you to do everyone should be checking their work give it to me
thank you everyone should be checking their homework where is your homework ms lee you are getting in front of screen yeah i will move it down just hold on a 2nd
hold on a 2nd move it up
i know just turn away all right so john had a question his hand popped up 1st and i think his question was with number 4 what was your question sweetheart
well i always tell you guys you have to do what you have to answer the question okay so what fraction of a dollar does she have yeah you could have written 3 fourths but so that i know that you understand and you gave me a clear cut solution i would have said 3 fourths of a dollar
now is there any way that you could have shown or modeled this any way you could have modeled it or any equation that you could have you know written to represent it i do not know mackenzie you could have drawn a rectangle come show me let her finish
put your hands down you could have drawn a rectangle huh split it into 44 groups huh i mean colored in 3 very very good 3 quarters and a dollar very very good yes could you have also done it ¢75 over a dollar yeah ¢75 over a dollar
yes you could have that is what i did 3 quarters and hillary finds 3 quarters 3 quarters equals ¢75 what fraction of a dollar does she have 75 of a 100 but what did they provide you here these are the same but how are they the same how do i get from this to this because there is 4 quarters to a dollar huh and 75 that is 25 75 that is 3 quarters
and a 100 is 4 so 75 is 3 because 75 is 3 quarters and a 100 that is 4 quarters so it is 4 75 is 3 quarters it is equivalent to 3 quarters and 100 is equivalent to 4 quarters very very good now how could i have went from here to here what operation could i have used adam division
division and you could have divided by what i would have divided by 43 over 3 what would be my greatest common factor between 75 and 100 25 25 that is all you got to do is slow down 25 over 25 and i would have gotten 3 fourths 3 fourths is just my answer in what simplest form
simplest form very very good did i have questions about any of the other problems here any other questions upton on number 8 i got d number 8 he got d i did not get it all right let us look at it let me stand back here
the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13 when we do sum what are we referring to rest addition addition
okay the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than the digit in the 100s place and 3 more than the one is digit
what is the number it is both who got it right i want to tell you how i would have gotten this answer i would have taken what they said here and i would have tried it out with each one okay i would have tried it out with each one but wait a minute the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number
that would have immediately eliminated d because d is what even how do we know that d is even everybody be quiet because the last number . now you see why it does not work yeah you got to read all of it it is an odd number i was thinking that like i did not look at the odd number i thought that was just like an example
so then i started with the digit in the 10s place is 4 less than that one yes but you have to read all of it the sum of the digits of a 3 digit number all of these are 3 digits the sum of the digits of a 3 digit odd number is 13 so the 1st thing i would have done is i would have actually added all these up to see if they were 13 plus the sum of the digits
and this one did not equal 13 so we crossed that one off 0 so this one did not equal 13 and it was even immediately i would have x would out d okay very very good hunter when i 1st i did it 2 times huh i 1st did i read the 4 less part
huh i thought 6 was a for some reason huh and because i did not read the whole thing that is why we have to read guys we have to read davis i am going to write about it i got something different on it
i did i added 4 and 2 fourths +one and 3 fourths we got 5 and 5 fourths but 5 fourths is not proper fractions so i divided 5 fourths 5 fourths divided by 4 and got one over 14th because after i divided i subtracted 4 -5 huh now give me one i know and get the 4 that is my denominator and added it to 5 and got 6 and 14th very good did you get b for 7 yes excellent excellent job
my mom taught me how to do it on the back very very good i want we are going to stop homework right now and i want you all to open up your composition books okay and i actually want you to go ahead and just turn to the title page or the table of contents
and in your table of contents you will just use a sheet of notebook paper sweetheart in your table of contents i want you to go ahead and write today is date january 30 2013
and i want you to write we will write addition and subtraction mixed number review now you guys know the main reason that we are doing this is because you know things are moving so fast
i just want to make sure you understand okay
and so what is going to happen is let me stop for a 2nd and let you guys get organized
all right i want you all to number your paper from one to 27 skip lines because you are going to write the problem act like you have fraction you are going to have fraction problems but you are going to have answers so you do one and you do a space 2 3 4 yeah like 2 spaces more like 2 spaces thank you yeah just space it out and go one to 27 you can actually do 2 columns
5 on that front good
so you are going to go from one to 27
and i am putting an index card on your desk do not do anything to it yet go to the back if you have to
or the next page a lot of extra number 6 27 that is what i said did you get one
27 27 stay on track 27 yeah i have got number 27 now everybody has an index card on their desk okay what you guys are going to do is you are going to actually locate the number on your card what number is this i am going to show you all where the number is located
the number is located in the top left hand corner like here this one is number 10 it is in the top left hand corner and you are going to write that problem down by the number and you are going to solve it but you guys get a chance to start moving around in the classroom after you solve the number on your card you go trade with a friend you solve the next number and you trade with someone else
you solve that one and you trade with someone else until i call time did we get it yes all right we are going to start in one minute
we are going to start in one minute and actually it is going to be more like 45 seconds and you are going to start with your problem and then you are going to get a chance to no running just walk okay what do i have i am not telling you just work at your own pace do not rush
make sure you do the ones that you have correctly can you just write the answer no i want the problem and the answer and it is okay to trade you do not have to keep your same card you just trade after you solve that problem you just keep trading
you may begin
pay attention to the operations because it is mixed review trying to find somebody to trade with you can trade with me i will trade with you i will trade with you
0 let me see what we are writing all right so you have 5 and 3 fifths
0 you did it on 12 okay go ahead and write get up and move girl move your bottom
you need somebody to trade with i would love to trade with you there you go you need somebody to trade with there you go
you want to trade with me there you go i would love to trade my dear okay let us see how we are doing over here okay let me check you out you are doing a great job let me show you something here let me see your pencil you did a great job here you added your fractions 1st your numerators 1st 3 well one and 3 is 4
you brought down your denominator 2 and 3 is 55 and 4 fourths 4 fourths equals what one whole so could not you go ahead and write your answer as 5 and 4 fourths equals if it is 6 wholes very very good you can go ahead and simplify that answer okay instead of keeping it that way
does that make sense okay very good okay let me get number 25 where is your pencil so you had 7 and 3 fifths -one and 3 fifths 6 and 0 fifths
well if you do not have if 3 fifths -3 fifths is 0 what should what should this be it should just be 6 very good there is no 0 fifths
okay well you could have no fifths depending on what the question asks but when you write if you are doing just straight computation like this you would see that 3 fifths and 3 fifths when you subtract 3 fifths and 3 fifths that cancels that out and you end up with 7 -one and you get what
a difference of 6 okay 5 sure like so yes because i had 27 and i did not know you had to do the same number what do you mean
for example if i if i if i had 27 and i did not know you i absolutely could . 0 you do not worry about that sweetheart you just keep working okay you want to try it with me 0 you got it right
you are okay you just keep working okay thank you all very much thank you all very much
thank you all very much thank you all very much you dropped some paper i already got this one i already got it we are going to try it with somebody else okay go try it with somebody else you tried it with me twice
okay let us see what you are doing here okay i am going to see we are both small so i can see you let me see all right let me see what you are doing okay good job simplify okay 0 here you did not simplify you just provided an equivalent fraction now what could you have done here
4 and 6 tenths yeah you can simplify that now show me how you would simplify the fraction part of that mixed number very good which is equivalent to 4 and 6 tenths very good 6
0 me 0 my have you done that one yet no who do i need to find 0 me 0 my let us try it again i do not know how to do it you done 21 no
all righty i do not know how to get it then whatever you have i have done 5 and 6 tenths let us look at this one let us look at this i have been waiting for somebody
let me see your hands okay all right right here you have got 5 and 6 tenths how would you convert the fraction part of that to a proper fraction or a mixed number because you would invert an improper to a mixed number so i am going to come down here with your answers okay and you have got 5 and 6 tenths do you remember how to convert an improper to a mixed do not you need to write it
yes you show me 12345678 i do not know but i do not want them to make us have to stop davis one and 15th one and a 5th so if you got one and a 5th as your mixed number for this that cancels this out right
so you have 5 wholes and one and a 5th what do you need to do to those 2 to make your answer do you add half of this one and then add this one yes and so what do you end up getting 6 and 13rd i mean 15th very good girl girl girl girl
stop you have been trading with me a lot i have number 18 can i trade i already did number 18 can you do number 25 all right
can you do number 25 no 0 yeah i will trade with you can i trade with you i have 18 you did number 27 yeah i do not have it i got number 27 i have number 27 the last person i saw had good number one was chris i have number one the last person i saw had everyone is number 10 she traded with me
what do you have 18 5 no 5 i have 5 have you had let me see if i have any low numbers on here you have had number 5 you have had number 17 you have had 19 you have had 5 you have had . yeah
you have not had 15 there you go i do not know what you had because you do not have your answer 321 freeze i want everyone to go back it is okay everyone to your seat and i want you to finish up that last problem sorry
that you are working on everyone to your seat and finish up the last problem that you are working on convert it huh you had your chance yes go to your seat
very good good practice to use in 321 mouths are off and everyone is seated mouths are off and everyone is seated
now i am going to put up some of the answers and i want you to check your work see how good you did okay you guys ready yes all right we are ready we are ready
yes all right shh check your work you see it mackenzie close my door shh shh
bless you
you will notice my answers i provided you the simplest form i converted any improper fractions to mixed numbers
have a seat and check your work can you go back
shh and it is okay if you did not get all of them done yes
how did we do wrong yes i got all wrong yes i want everybody to put your head on your desk down down i do not want to see your eyes heads down do not want to see your eyes do not want to see your eyes i want you to raise your hand if you need my help
hands down i want you to i am going to be more specific raise your hand if you do not understand how to convert an improper to a mixed number hands down
raise your hand if you need help simplifying fractions if you understand all of it stand up and say i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this i got this all right everybody sit down
i got this sit down chris do not ruin it hands down for homework tonight we are going to come back i just had to get my hand
and what i want you all to do is still problem solving because tomorrow you get an opportunity to go back and look at your chapter 15 test
okay and you are going to be practicing adding like fractions meaning like denominators 15 one and on the back you are going to be subtracting like fractions meaning like denominators 15.2 show all of your work and guys number 9 on here you need to answer that okay
give me a clear well thought out response understand yes madam understand yes madam now antonella did something that i thought was very smart she took her homework from last night and she glued it into her composition book i would like for you all to go ahead and do that while i pass out your homework and once you are done you can go ahead and take a restroom break
and when you come to the door bring me the index cards glue it in hold on a 2nd let me pass these out okay yeah you do not have a composition book yet you just got here
so i am going to have to send your mom another send her a supply list okay i know they gave her one in the office but i need to email her if you did not get homework raise your hand
i did not tell anyone to open my door i said i would be standing at the door to get the index cards so close my door
