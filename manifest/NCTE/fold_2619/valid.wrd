and this is the microphone jabari so you hear what i am saying to you guys yes so they can hear you also umm kendall what fraction is this blue color 13rd 13rd i do not have marker colors to match everything
i really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands
and the pink pink is what kyla
it is not important really right now just ignore 14th please 14th thank you and i am hearing a lot of talking again deanthony you have not raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything better
who can tell me which color i need to pull out next raise your hand if you can tell me what color is next akasia one 5th umm we had one half 13rd 14th what do we do now i am remembering that when we were folding these if i folded a 14th in half what would each half be
i am sorry i am going to wait for a 2nd really nicholas all the little noises need to stop that shows me you are not focused at all and it disturbs other people around you they stop yes ophelia
okay but i was thinking ophelia when we did it i think we might have done one 8th next thank you so let us go to one 8th please and one 8th is purple so if we fold a 14th in half we got 8 ths so purple is one 8th yes ian how wait where was number one why was that one there
i see deshanique talking right now i see malcolm moving yes colby
yeah because it is aqua it is aqua thank you colby for raising your hand okay and white is one 6th everybody get your white ones out one 6th yes nicholas uhh
i do not really remember
yeah so you just i mean .
panther pride so if 0 i forgot to put one thing up there what is one half of one 6th one half of what hand raised please boys and girls i need all of you thinking i see kendall is thinking and nicholas is thinking nicholas you do not even have it there
what would one half of 16th be one 12th one 12th if we take 16th and fold it in 2 parts or divide it into it is one 12th and one 12th is what color blue red or is it red actually it was supposed to be brown blue okay
this is one 16th blue is yeah okay so red is one whoa whoa
all right so today we are going to use our fraction strips for 2 things all eyes up here please all hands empty we have been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators but some of us are still kind of struggling with that so i want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again
we started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block but now we are going to try it with the fraction strip so you have another way to really see what you are doing when you are adding and subtracting your fractions and we are also going to use them to model multiplication which we have not really done before
in the past few days or probably a week i have asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply if i am doing 3 times 2 what is another way to describe that problem i am multiplying 3 times 2 what are 2 ways to solve that problem
i can just multiply and i know it is 3 times 2 but what is another way paige adding 3 add so multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add 3 times 2 means 32 times so 3 +33 times 3 of course means 3 +3 +333 times
so remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again so if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers we can use repeated addition to figure out how to multiply those fractions
so the 1st problem we are going to try is and you are going to actually have to actually i will use one of the smaller fractions to start with so let us try one 12th times 3 how could you solve the problem one 12th times 3
one 12th times 3 what does that mean one 12th times 3 malcolm how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem i used i used one of these 12s okay and use all my 3s
okay malcolm when we did 3 times 2 we needed how many 3s 3 how many 3s did we need 111 how many 3s did we need 2222 so if i am multiplying one 12th times 3 how many one 12 ths do i need how many okay when we do 3 times 22221 12th times 3 how many one 12th do i need
3 i need 3 31 12th times 3 means 31 12 ths so get 31 12 ths please 31 12 ths akasia please share with kyla or share with colby actually
3 or 21 12 ths what was that 3 or 2 what is the problem saying 3 times 3 so 3 of the ones 12 ths nicholas okay is it show me please show me please
i see maisie and leila have free one 12 ths put on their desk please do it and especially share with jabari paige has her 31 12 ths malcolm has has 31 12 ths malcolm can you organize those line them up next to each other please deshanique do you have your 31 12 ths put them in front of you on your desk umm okay got it
okay panther pride so one 12th times 3 equals what one 12th times 3 equals what what is it kendall 3 12 ths one times 3 is 33 can also be written 3 divided by one that is still the number 3 right
if you have 3 and you divide it by one our answer is 3 so if we multiply one times 3 we get 3 if we multiply 12 times one we get 12 please do not kick or moan or groan thank you thank you
boys and girls i am just going to pause again for a 2nd i am hearing so much squirming it is very distracting so one 12th times 34 equals 3 12 ths i would like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12 ths
find another shape that is equivalent to 3 12 ths and show me please 3 12 ths show me on your desk is that it show me please line them up next to each other
deanthony you can you please get this here what was your way maybe it is definitely 14th all right
akasia did you find a fraction that equals 3 12 ths one 12th does one 12th equal 3 4 ths no 14th 14th 14th show me please i do not see it on your desk i see that you have it out but can you please show me 4 times 3 right here does 14th equals 3 12 ths yes yes it does
14th equals 3 12 ths yes deshanique
umm i would like to find please find how many 16 ths are equal to 14th show me on your desk please how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we know 3 12 ths and 14th are equal
how many 16 ths equal 14th one 16th
calm down okay kyla that is not a reduce your time right now please stop maisie how many sixteenths are equal to we do not really need this how many sixteenths are equal to 14th
4 okay can you bring your cards up to show me up here please okay boys and girls i am still hearing so much whispering maisie is going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to 14th we just figured out 3 12 ths equals one fouth let us see how many sixteenths equal 14th
please stop whispering malcolm please stop umm not sure you go ahead and press focus right there it is just light it is okay
okay so 14th 0 there it is it is brighter 14th equals okay 14th equals 4 16 ths so what kind of multiplication problem could we write to describe that
14th times something equals 4 16 ths what would our multiplication problem be akasia go ahead 14th times 14th times 4 fourths 14 times 4 fourths is it 4 fourths yes 14th times how many one fourths did we use i am sorry one 16th i wrote that wrong my fault
i wrote that very wrong so 4 16 ths 0 yes hold on here one 16th one 16th times something equals 14th thank you maisie now i do not know you do know one 16th times something sorry maisie
so akasia here is 14th one 16th times all right colby do you know what boys and girls too many of us are not following the rules
i have probably said 10 times since we started stop whispering this is what it should sound like malcolm akasia go ahead umm one 16th times what equals 14th 4 yes
one 16th times 4 equals 14th if we were to just multiply this one times 4 equals 4 16 times one equals 16 and then we know that 14th is an equivalent fraction to 4 16 ths wait until christian comes back please
christian is coming i can not even the number
christian come on quickly okay okay so how about if we added 4 16 ths +14th what fraction would we come up with 4 16 ths +one 4th
4 16 ths +14th you can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator colby and deanthony stop
i am just trying to get your 4 16 ths +14th akasia you got it figured out already
you know it is something on the alphabet on the alphabet yeah what do you mean
umm akasia please get focused
kyla try it please 4 16 ths +one 4th christian did you figure it out is that why you are waving your hand around no okay so christian and deshanique i see it looks like kendall also has it figured out deanthony do you have it figured out panther pride panther pride
thank you that is better i am glad you are excited but it is way too noisy umm
christian and deshanique will you please come show us how you solve the problem
okay 4 16 ths +14th i will try to help you get it off the camera it is okay everybody has them in front of them anyway go ahead share with your classmates so how we figured this problem out is 12nd let me see if your classmates are listening to you hands are empty eyes and ears are on christian and deshanique justin head up off your desk akasia in your chair
deanthony and colby you are listening you are not whispering at all go ahead so how we solved the problem was we put 16th right here and 14th right here did you put 16th right here how many sixths did you put here how many 4 4 16 ths +14th equals one half can you show me please
okay so 4 16 ths +14th equals one half so we have been doing these problems but what have we been doing instead of modeling them adding them what did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we did not have our models kyla add we are still adding but what did we do differently what did we have to do 1st
1st we have 1st we have to multiply multiply what 4 times 4 equals 6 equals i mean 16 okay so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number right okay so 4 16 ths plus what would this number be 4 fourths
4 what right there yep
stand up and walk please all right kyla is going to prove to us malcolm and kendall that 14th +4 16 ths equals what kyla how many 16 ths 88 16 ths 8 16 ths should be equal to what other fraction one half very good
okay let us prove it okay so one half also equals everybody everybody 8 16 ths thank you
okay because you are playing with that i was they were not it does not matter okay you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary i need all eyes up here eyes jabari if you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems you can
it is more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions we only really did one example that just reminded me okay have a seat please kyla thank you so when we multiply fractions it is just like repeated addition so what would one 16th times 3 be one 16th times 3
please try it with your fraction card one 16th times 3 kyla you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips one 16th times 3 deshanique is thinking she has it colby is about to try
good kendall is working it out i got it kendall has got it i got it justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try and go put those cushions back in the classroom library thank you take ian is too maisie has got it akasia has got it
nicholas has it 0 i did it panther pride ophelia i still see you talking akasia one 16th times 3 equals one 6th
one 16th times 3 where are you showing me on your desk it might equal 16th but can you please show me kyla maisie one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 3 16 ths may i have panther pride
ian thank you i see that you are quiet christian put that away maisie how did you figure out that one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths 0 well the 1st way i knew is because we did it before and did we do it before yeah we did we did
and that that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do 3 times one okay one times 3 equals 33 and then
thank you deshanique thank you ian thank you kendall and nicholas and malcolm okay 16 times one is 16 now maisie you said i moved the one down here and i just need to clarify that you place it down thank you akasia kyla i need you paying attention jabari the learning is occurring over here turn around please why did i put the one down here
what does 3 over one mean or 31st what does that mean ophelia well a girl means that i know why but it was the it was done because because if you multiply 16 by 3 it would not make any sense because then you would have 3 something something and not really ready to do that math
but but the denominator would have to stay the same but if you multiplied it by anything but one it would not be the same okay let us think too though about what 3 divided by one means remember that fractions also represent division problems so 3 divided by one equals what 333 divided by one equals 3
so if i write 3 in my numerator and one in my denominator i am really still just writing the number 3 but i can see that when i multiply or add one 16th 3 times i have 3 16 ths kyla turn around please get focused again one 16th times 3 equals 3 16 ths
let us try a different one seeing as i would already done that problem how about 14th times 314 times 3 show me please show me show me show me i know a lot of you are doing it in your head but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip i do not have a 3rd so i can not show you 14th times 3
it is easy 14th times 3 deshanique has it paige has it malcolm has not done it yet show me please you show me what 14th times 3 looks like
did any fall 3 fourths that is important jabari please show me 14th times 3
once you show me is this 3 fourths right here that is 3 fourths right and you said it equals 3 12 ths what is this
panther pride thank you for your patience one 4th times 3 so jabari what did we figure out 14 times 3 equals 3 fourths can you please turn in this direction thank you one times 3 equals 34 times one equals 43 fourths okay
umm raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions deshanique you want one more yeah i want one you know this already though do not you nicholas let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out right me too how about 2 sixths times 42 sixths times 4 i am changing a little bit now because our numerator is not one anymore
2 sixths times 4 give it a try 2 sixths times 4 how would we do that work it out please in front of you 2 sixths times 4 it is not 8 12 ths work it out 2 sixths times 4 work it out before you show all your answers show me what is the problem no show me 2 sixths times 4
turn around show me jabari show me 2 sixths times 4 there are not any how can you make 2 thirds and you might have to participate with somebody next to you also okay
it is not 8 12 ths ian you are going to have to cooperate with these 2 we need to share because 2 sixths times 4 did you make a substitution or
thank you ian thank you kendall ummm kendall you look like you are close to a solution for this problem actually jabari can you jabari will you please walk kendall and deshanique and ian could the 3 of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem
paige it is their turn to share get ready to listen please
deshanique we should be quiet and listening to our classmates akasia listening please boys and girls i am listening for silence right now maisie lift your head up
kyla sit up straight christian thank you paige i see you listening jabari i see you pretty ready justin is ready that equals 2 let me see if i can help that equals 8 12nd 8 12nd please
your classmates are not ready deshanique ophelia we are listening malcolm you must listen to each other akasia have a seat kyla put both of your feet on the floor and listen
how did you get those 8 sixths though how did you decide that you needed 8 sixths we put uhh all of our sixths together 12nd 12nd please kendall you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening getting better put that down
put your hands down and pay attention deanthony so how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the 1st place how did you decide you needed that many 4 times 8 uhh 4 times 2 sixths and we did not have enough so we added can you show me 2 sixths please
what did you use to make 2 sixths okay so jabari do you see how 21 sixths makes 2 sixths yes okay and how many sets of 2 sixths did we need jabari 2 how many did we need what was our original problem i do not know if you can see it over here ian and deshanique step to the side for a moment please what was our original problem jabari 2 6 ths times 4 go sit down what 2 6 ths times 4
okay 2 sixths times 4 so they have 1234 sets of 2 sixths right jabari yeah okay and akasia what was their solution then 2 sixths times 4 equals 26 times right here nicholas 26 times 4 equals is what 8 6 ths
okay do you see that akasia 1234567 okay so 8 sixths now we have an improper fraction
okay okay so one and 2 sixths once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed mixed number they had one and 2 sixths so jabari how many sixths does it take to make 11
how many sixths does it take to make one how many sixths does it take to make one jabari jabari what does the denominator tell us what does the denominator of a number tell us colby
the number tells you like like like how much it is in the whole how many what in the whole what do you mean by how much how much whatever you are how many parts 0 parts equal parts how many equal parts so jabari how many equal parts do you need to make a whole if each part is 16th
jabari you need 6 sixths to make one whole 6 sixths equals one right okay you guys are going to try some of these on your own yes you may now
can i go to the bathroom what was that what was the question kendall
are we allowed to do our work under this yeah of course
please stop chitter chatting
yep looks good i need my bag you do not need your bag
is this wrong miss is this wrong
what would 3 thirds be if you have 3 parts 3 parts altogether you have 3 parts of the 3 altogether
okay so not right now you could do that you can work it up that way or you can work it up with a strip
okay 2 4 ths
panther pride panther pride one of your classmates has a request for some silent time and i do not disagree spend the next few minutes working without talking you are facing your own paper kyla akasia already yes leila umm
akasia please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit what was that yep
nicholas keep the congratulations inside your head for a few minutes so it is okay that is not a big deal
kendall they are here i am sorry nicholas wow we did not even last for one minute paige it is silent time right now
boys and girls kyla
you are sitting there doing nothing
are we getting our work done no
