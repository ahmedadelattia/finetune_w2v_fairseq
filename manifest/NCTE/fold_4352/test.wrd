all right this is what we are going to be doing today that is okay she likes to be sat in closets all right today we are going to do a couple of things we talked a little bit about the area model on friday we just touched upon it we are going to we are going to do it today okay some of the kids had trouble in the other class
i am going to try to make it real simple okay hand down maneli and then we are going to also use estimation to help us get in the right ballpark as far as our answers go okay so i will move around i know the camera is in the way so let us talk about estimation 1st
take out your math notebooks and let us copy this problem down 25 x 84 okay benny you got a math notebook buddy
take it out okay we are going to estimate both of these numbers okay
why do you think estimation you should do it before you do every single multiplication problem why is it why is it a good strategy to do bella because it makes it easier because you will have even numbers okay but how is it going to help us like why why are we estimating
why am i estimating right now before why do not why do not i just solve the problem why do not i do 25 x 84 why am i making you do this extra step anybody know because it might help us how is it going to help us i already said it at the beginning of the class how is it going to help us maneli
it is going to help explain what you are thinking or no it is not going to help explain my thinking patrick it is going to help us because it makes it easier okay i need something a little more clearer than that benny like it it makes it easier how does it make it easier patrick
to to make an estimation and make an estimation and get close to the answer okay it is going to help us get close to the answer which will help us do what if we estimate it is going to help us get close to the actual answer why is that important why is that important
so you can find the answer so we can find the answer because what i have been seeing a lot okay so let me do another problem right here what i have been seeing a lot is when people are multiplying okay when people are multiplying say i have a problem and i am doing it this way
22 x 46 what i am seeing a lot is that people are not multiplying accurately so you are not doing say you did 80 instead of 800 well your answer is going to be way off so you need to recognize that you know what i need to add one more 0 there to make it 800 and i have seen it in the previous class
i saw it a lot at the beginning and i am and i see it in this class as well so if i estimate if i take 22 x 46 and i estimate that if i round the numbers up to 20 x 50 i know that my answer is going to be somewhere around a 1000
so whittler if i did make a mistake and i forgot to add a 0 and i did have 80 hopefully when i am done adding my products up i say to myself something is not right my estimate my estimation my estimate i am going to be close to a 1000 i am going to be around a 1000 i might be a little under i might be a little over
but i know i am not going to get an answer of say 220 so it is going to help you realize that when you are computing when you are multiplying your partial products together that you know what i think i might have left out a 0 i think i might have made a mistake so it will help us become more accurate so let us go back to the original does everybody understand that
yes yes okay so 25 x 84 when we estimate we round we have 2 digit numbers we are going to round to the nearest 10 25 30 30 good so let us put it underneath i like to write an e for estimate for an estimate just so you know so 30 okay 84
80 80 good ah multiplying with 0s right 3 x 8 somebody raise their hand and tell me 3 x 8 jenna 24 let us add the 2 0s 2400 so i know i am going to be somewhere around 2400 okay one of the kids at the end of the class in the previous class one of the word problems on that paper that you have excuse me
when he when he did it his estimate was actually the same as the actual answer sometimes it happens okay sometimes not all the time most of the times it will not so i know i am going to be 30 x 80
okay i want you to solve this problem any way that you want any way that we practiced on friday okay let us go kyle solve it any way we want solve it any way you want i would like to see you use the rectangle okay that is the way we were practicing we are going to solve 25 x 84
now we do not solve the estimate this is just to help us okay that is just to help us 25 x 84 i see ella is already working there 25 x 84 that is what you are solving right now 25 x 84
25 x 84 25 x 84 good 0 thank you keep on i am determined to use these papers keep on
do you have one okay is it all coming back to you now what was that long that those 2 days off there you go you ready to go
good just be accurate with your multiplication no no how can it be 40000 when our estimate is 2400 all right so let us 25 84
20 x 80 what is that 10000 no what is 2 x 80 16 how many 0s 16 are all . how many 0s are in the equation how many 0s 22 1600 right 20 x 4 what is 2 x 48 and add a 0 right 80
okay now we go to the bottom 5 x 8 is 40 5 x 80 yeah so 5 x 8 think of 5 x 8 basic fact add a 0 400 5 x 4 is 20 20 add those up add all these up yeah and plus yeah add yes and then this will be the answer that will be the answer yes just do not add up the numbers on the outside
those are the numbers that you know add up these numbers can i get them up right there okay 0 bottom right 5 x 80 5 x 4 right right you did the top now you have got to do the bottom
yeah nice good 0 sara sara sara sara sara 0 yeah thank you what did you do let me see 0 wait no you you made the boo boo right there
i did too no you were good do you recognize the boo boo recognize the mistake you said 5 x 80 is 40 last time i checked 5 x 8 is 40 good good i will be right there
good good yeah no mistake right there you have got to add all these up you have got it all right just add those up right go ahead keep on going good ah mistake right here 5 x 8
you have got to add that 0 right 84 is the number right you keep the numbers the same okay alright yeah there you go what is 5 x 8 though 0 okay you have got to redo that i know 0 i love it i see the same mistake all the time and this is why i am going to show you the area model 84
0 no 0 you copied it different okay let me see yes you are right you are right good all right let us have okay 4 x 2 huh 8 4 x 2 me no her 4 x 2
4 x 2 4 488 so that should be 8 right all right whittler let me see 0 you added wrong bring your bring your paper up yeah
yeah add them up and you get your answer okay whittler tell us what you multiplied have a seat i multiplied 20 x 80 yes and what did we get as an answer 1600 1600 somebody refresh my memory about what the estimate was
what did we say the estimate was sara 2400 2400 i am going to just write that up here this is our estimate okay what did we multiply next we multiplied 5 x 4 we got 20 okay 5 x 4 you got 20 continue then we multiplied 5 x 80 yes we got 400
good then we multiplied 20 x . 20 x what 20 x 4 and you got 8 okay we added those up and the answer is 2100 our estimate was 2400 are we in the right ballpark yes yes we are
so i feel comfortable with that answer all right now this is what i saw a lot this is why i am going to show you the area model today this is what i saw from at least 3 different people you did 5 x 80 and you put 40 you just did the basic fact of 5 x 8
you did not add the 0 from the 80 to get 400 okay so that is a mistake that a lot of people make just because you are going and sometimes you forget well if we look at the area model here i know i talked a little bit about it on friday somebody refresh my memory about how the area model you can go back to your seat thank you
actually keep your notebook there for a 2nd i will give it back to you you can sit down so you can see this how the area model here is different from the strategy on the board how is the area model different from the strategy on the board patrick prosper
the numbers are probably like 20 will be bigger and 10 times will be smaller okay he is on the i know what he is saying but let us get it exact okay you heard what patrick says you know what he means but let us say it exactly the way it should be bella
you did 30 going down and you did so that means you did one going down right 5 yes so would it be like area basically the length and the width are going to be i am looking for a word it is going to be what
another word for precise that begins with an a exact no that is an e but that is another word an a it is going to be what the length and the width are going to be accurate accurate accurate yes the length and the width are going to be accurate
the rectangles inside the area model are going to show what they are really supposed to look like so when i multiply with this one they do 38 x 26 so when i do 30 x 20 the answer is 600
the value of that product is going to look bigger than the other ones because i am multiplying the 2 biggest numbers together with this one up here okay this one is kind of like what they call the partial product okay we just write the equations
now we do it in that rectangle because you guys and gals were having a hard time figuring out what numbers to multiply so that is a strategy that helps us organize the partial product okay this one is showing how big the rectangles inside the area should be
so when i am doing 30 x 20 hopefully if i put 60 there i realize that whoa that rectangle is way too big to be 60 it should be 600 i must have forgot to add a 0 well this little one i am going to know where to put that equation of 8 x 6
8 x 6 is by far the smallest equation there so it better go in the small rectangle right in the bottom right so we are going to learn how to make the area model today okay and if you like the area model you can continue using it if you do not like it you can go back to using the partial product either way you just have to be accurate
you have to recognize your mistakes when you make one so if i left out a 0 i know that i have to add that 0 okay does everybody understand that yes okay let me show you an example of what one of the kids did in class that way i can show you what we did they had some trouble with this i am not sure why they just were not very accurate when they were counting
so our goal today is to make the area model as you can see up here now this is an area model of 38 x 12
okay and if we get the hang of this then i will break you up into your groups you can solve the word problems on your desk in your groups and then you can have all the work if we have time okay we will have time this afternoon as well so look at what one of the students did the problem was 38 x 12
okay so the length they did 30 they separated according to place value right 38 i am just going to make a little line there i will do a plus sign 30 +8 is 38 right expanded notation so they counted 30 alana and tiana
30 down with one color and then 8 down with another so we separated the 10s place from the ones place there does everybody see that does that seem overly difficult no okay good so we all feel comfortable counting yes good you would be surprised at what i saw last class all right now we go over to the next one the 2nd number is 12
so again she separated according to place value she did 10 across and then 2 across okay now i used grid paper for this to help us out you do not need to color in the boxes all you do is you make a line so if the number is 38 i do 30 with one color and then 8 with another
and then i can use the same 2 colors for the width or i could use 2 different colors it does not matter and i went 10 across and then she went 10 across and then 2 across now the reason why we use 2 different colors where the 10s place and ones place meet is right here
this section right here separates the 10s place from the ones place so what we do is we draw a line there and that will help us get the correct areas for each equation that we multiply so when she did 10 x 8 say you did not know your facts at all but you could make the area model 10 x 8 there is going to be 80 little squares in here
so you can literally count them 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and you can get your answer okay and it is going to help you because if you get stuck and you are like mister porter i do not know what numbers i have to add would it make sense if you did 8 x 10 in this rectangle right here okay that has 80 boxes
8 x 10 is 80 8 x 2 is 16 if you came up here and you counted that there would be 16 boxes now the horizontal line where the 2 different colors meet is where you draw your line going up it is that simple any questions about that
i had kids just to warn you i had kids making the line the vertical line anywhere they wanted to they were not doing it where the 2 colors met they just put it here so when they went to go do it it did not look right it was not accurate if i counted those squares there should be 80 squares here
if we counted this there should be 300 squares in that rectangle right there because that is the area that is the length and the width of this rectangle there should be 60 squares here so this is going to be a lot more accurate than doing it with the partial product in the rectangle okay so we are going to do a couple of problems
i am going to pass out this type of paper okay everybody understand yes okay we are going to do the 1st one together if i feel like we are getting it and we can do it then i am going to break you up into your groups okay and you are going to use the area model to help you solve the word problems and some of you i have different word problems for different groups okay
some of you i might give a bigger problem too once we do it with the centimeter paper here okay once we are done with that then we can move on to doing it without it just using a regular piece of paper okay so we will talk about that as well all right
so let us see sarah i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody emily i need you to pass out a piece of paper to everybody so everybody should have 2 pieces of paper okay
the goal is to be so good at making the area model you can do it as quick as making the other rectangle okay now i am going to show you when i do it on the board i am not going to use any graph paper to help me
make sure you do not forget benny in the back okay so take out 2 colored crayons 32 x 24 let us write the problem at the top of your paper
you do not have to write it super big so you take up the whole paper sara can you give them another one thank you is that for whoever is like watching us yeah they are watching you right now point down they are watching me more than they are watching you what
they are watching me teach more than they are watching you they are not watching the program they are showing how i teach okay okay so 32 x 24 watch what i do 1st before we even begin we are going to estimate
because when we estimate it is going to help us get in the right ballpark help us know where our answer should be round not exactly so 32 alex what am i going to round 32 to what number 30 30 good 24 chris 20 20
0 that is nice and easy and once you get good at estimating it is something that you can just do in your head you can look at the problem and solve it in your head some of you can some of you might take a little more practice 30 x 62600 see how quick you did that right so our answer is going to be around 600 let me ask you this question is it going to be smaller or larger than 600 why
and tell me why why is our answer going to be smaller or larger than 600 why jasmine we have not heard from you all day jasmine why is our number is our actual answer going to be smaller or larger larger why is it going to be larger
say that again i only rounded the 10s so you said i only rounded the 10s and you have to round the ones ah i need something else something else who can tell me alex we rounded down with both of the numbers there you go we rounded down with both of the numbers the actual numbers are 32
come on people 32 so they are larger they are larger so of course our answer is going to be larger okay our actual numbers 32 and 24 are both larger than 30 and 20 so our answer is going to be greater than 600 if you had an answer smaller than 600 that should raise a red flag okay red flag loosen up people my goodness
i should have the camera emily who is also well behaved all right 32 x 24 so what you are going to do is you are going to take a color you are not going to color in any of the squares there you are going to count 30 now i am going to do it without it and my rectangle that i make my area is going to look just like yours
we are going to do 30 down so count 30 draw a line and then label it and then you are going to take a different color and you are just going to do 2 because that would represent the ones place and then you are going to do 2 so i have 32
now you can do this without actually drawing without using graph paper once you get the handle of it now obviously 30 is going to be a lot greater than 2 okay everybody have that yes no no 30 down honey you have got to count 30 down draw a line right on the line there you go is it like this is it 30 that does not look like 30 to me
30 down do you have 30 down i am going to trust you there good now draw 2 down yes sure okay 30 now draw a different color is that a different color use a different color for those 2 and write 2
now my only question is you did it so far over here i do not think you are going to have room to draw 24 going in a horizontal line right try it on the back and start on the left you do not look like you where do you want to go i did not . where is 30 30 down 30 down a line 30 down can you count 30 down go ahead start at yeah there you go
where is my 30 that is not 30 honey you are drawing a line 30 down do you see my line a vertical line going 30 down yes okay that does not look like 30 to me my dear let us count that count that
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 you have 14 there i actually want 30 i want a line of 30 and then with another color a line of 2 bella do you have it let me see yes why why are you coloring that in i just want a line
a line kids this is what i want to see my goodness see i told you a line see that she has a line of 30 i can walk by and i notice that she has a line of 30 with another color she did a line of 2 any concerns right now who can not draw a line count by 30 going down
if you need help please raise your hand i will be more than happy to help you here is my 30 okay because i am not seeing it my 30 it looks okay from the yeah i see it i can tell here is my 20 yeah now what bella is going to do is she is going to take a color and the number is 24 so she is going to go 20 across actually count 20
not 15 not 10 not 19 20 and then she is going to stop she is going to use another color to count 4 so can we all make an l please yes go ahead thank you thank you you can still do it that looks much better i can tell right now yes 0 sorry we have to do 20
that looks more than 30 can you count 30 man come on 123456 is that 20 yeah good so write 20 right there now with another color make 4 separating the 10th place from the one place from right extended yeah no 4 go on continue it there you go
good write 4 right there there you go perfect okay so that is what ella just did okay 32 then she has 20 across and then 4 across good yeah right
now all ella has to do she is basically done is she just has to close up the area model so she just takes any color she wants and she is going to close up the rectangle so she is going to take a color she is going to draw up and over so now we have a rectangle can we do that yes okay make it happen
you have a question anybody we are doing 20 on the bottom yeah we are doing 24 we are making 32 by 24 array basically okay did you have enough room you did
good is that 20 now you have to do another 4 square yeah because we are doing the number 24 and you will be okay so do not worry about it all right 32 24
even though i think that is more than 30 buddy but that is okay no okay now you think it is more than 30 yes there is 10 20 there is 30 right there that is where 30 should be
so there is 30 here is 2 so this is where it should be right here okay you see that you see that okay once you have made your rectangle close it up that looks no 24
one number 21234 okay now i have chris is paper right here chris closed up he has an array now all right that is what we are doing is we are making an array
now the reason why i had you use different colors is so you know where to draw the lines so he has orange and red here so where his orange and red vertical line meet he is going to draw a line going across straight across it does not matter what color it is hopefully he will draw it straighter than i just did hey hey hey
that was not good so he is going to draw it across on the line and then where his horizontal line is is where the 20 meets the 4 it is tough to tell here okay let me write it up okay right here see it is easy i just counted he is going to draw a line going up
now if he solves it rightly if he counted this he will be able to accurately know the product for each equation that he is going to make does everybody understand that yes okay so draw you are going to draw a horizontal and a vertical line if you do not know good perfect
let me see yours vertical and horizontal okay vertical astronaut remember astronauts sleep because in space because of . gravity no gravity okay that is perfect right there
now when she multiplies i hope she is going to realize where she puts 2 x 4 yes right and if you put 2 x 4 in this rectangle right here we have some . big problem we have a little bit of concern right so this is going to help us accurately find the answer to the product to each of the rectangles
notice how we have 4 rectangles so you are going to have 4 equations you can write the equation right inside each of them maybe not that one because it is so small okay there you go calista i will be right back is this perfect yes perfect
yes now multiply them together you made a loop you are not going to be and you can still get the answer but you do not have 32 here you have 31 see that how you only have one right there see how he has 2 rows right 0 yeah you can still figure it out dominic can i help you no dominic you do not do that huh who ellis emily is
this is emily is yes that is ellis and this is emily is perfect okay multiply them together okay see what you have right here draw a line here all the way across
and draw a line here okay you got it now we have 4 rectangles right what is 2 x 4 watch if i do not know look i can count 2468 is my answer right yeah it is right there it is perfect perfect now solve it
solve it so right here then you just count up from this line do 30 x 20 honey okay
yeah perfect how do i get it now can you do it for me okay everybody stop for a 2nd let us look at alex alex wrote 24 on the top and the bottom that is okay whatever helps
kyle can you look here so we can do it right bud all right so he did 30 x 20 now if i wanted to torture alex which i might later on i might have him count every single square here and if he counted every single square there would be 600 because 30 x 20 is 600 correct brianna yes awesome 600 i like how he wrote the equation inside the inside the rectangle okay perfect
so he has 4 arrays here he has a 30 by 20 then below this he wrote 20 here look he is going to do 2 x 20 and he is going to have 40 if he counted each of those squares there would be 40 squares there so 2 x 20 is 40
so unlike using the rectangle or the box some people call it right which just has 4 even rectangles this is giving us the actual answer for each equation okay so if you did 30 x 20 and you forgot to add a 0 and you said 60 you should know that you made a mistake a big mistake
look at how big this is then 2 x 4 is a small equation and we have a small answer and we have a small rectangle there we have a small array right here 8 and then the last one 30 x 4 so he wrote it over here close to it that is okay 30 x 4 is 120
there is 120 squares right here in this array does everybody see that yes question patrick yes yes okay i think we need to try at least one more so turn your paper over if you used both sides already then just get your other paper
that is why i gave you 2 papers huh okay i know i am walking around you do not have to show me what is the next one mister porter okay so the next one let us do a little bit smaller
let us do 20 28 x 12 now before we begin we are going to estimate i always want you to yes we are going to do that you can do it here but do not do anything yet 1st we are going to estimate
so write down the actual problem and then we are going to estimate you should always estimate before you solve the problem some of you chris i feel pretty confident that you could do that in your head right yes so i am going to put you to the test in a 2nd so 28 chris rounded is what 30 30 10 i mean 12 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
what is 30 x 10 300 300 see he did it in his head but i am writing it down so we know that 28 x 12 is going to be somewhere around 300 so if we have an answer like 3000 we know that we did something wrong and if we can do the area model correctly we know that we are going to be extremely accurate and that we will not get it wrong
so let us do 28 x 12 so that means 28 x 120 the pen do not feel me now his button is flashing is it yeah the pen do not feel me
i can not do that tapping thing there it goes okay 28 x 12 i am going to separate the 28 into a 20 +8 right expand it 4 i will even do a different color so the 10s place is going to be a different color than the ones place
that way i know where to draw the line once you get the hang of it you will not have to do that okay so 20 with one color so count down 20 i am going to use red so i am going to count down 20 right go ahead ella with a crayon
20 and then a different color i am going to color the ones place 8 not color but draw a line and i am going to label them so i have 28 same number 28 it is one number
i am just separating the 10s place and the ones place okay x 12 make sure you count it so 2 different colors there everybody see that like this just like if that is 28 then you did it right any questions horizontal line
i am going to do 12 so i might use the same 2 colors i might use 2 different colors it does not matter i am going to do 10 this time notice that my 10 here is a lot smaller than the 20 so the next step is doing this without graph paper you still want to be fairly accurate
and then 2 for the 12 so it is going to look a lot smaller i might even make it a little bit smaller okay so i have my l i am just going to finish making my array
it does not matter what color it is okay now where your 2 lines meet you are going to draw 2 lines horizontal line and i am going to draw my vertical line
now even though i did not use graph paper i bet you your array that you just made is going to look a lot like mine i can look at bella is right now i can look at maneli right now john is this whole row right here and theirs looks a lot like mine except the lines are straighter right okay so finish it off right here finish it off
up and over perfect perfect now write your equations okay okay label 28 good we will draw a line here
and draw a line here okay right now you are good to go perfect and if you get stuck you can count now do 10 and 2 up there and you can even do 10 and 2 down there it does not matter good when you have your area model set up solve the equation i just got here 0 you just got here
0 instrument people okay you are going to have to rely on jasmine to help you out here i like friday is friday is my favorite okay instead of just making a rectangle like we did last week what we are doing is we are doing an area model
so this is going to be the arrays are going to be exact so when i do 20 x 2 i know it is going to go right there i should have exactly 40 squares there 20 x 10 there is going to be 200 squares right here okay so it is going to look exactly the way it should be the array is going to be accurate when we do this right all the rectangles are the same yeah i am good
okay before the camera leaves let us solve this problem somebody john tell me an equation 10 x 8 equals 80 10 x 8 equals 80 tell me which one is that going to go into
so the bottom left very good it is 10 x 8 does it matter if i do 8 x 10 or 10 x 8 no no it does not okay here it goes 80 somebody tell me another equation
patrick prosper 10 x 20 equals 200 can you tell me what box that is going in top left top left i love it good 20 x 10 equals 200 okay i have 2 more arrays left 2 more arrays calissa huh 2 x 8 and which one is that going in
bottom right bottom right excellent and then i have one more somebody jordan there is one more array and what is 2 x 20 40 we add up our answers 3
okay and we are all set chris what did you have as an estimate again 300 300 let us see what we get 280 40 +16 is 56 336 our estimate was 300
our actual answer is 336 not bad huh no do we get it yes okay after lunch our next step is to do it just with our notebook paper and then you can solve your word problems in your groups okay so nice job
