I'm gonna go with forty dollars on clothes. I'm gonna go with... thirty dollars on books. And I'm gonna go with...
Um, like yours, do we have to do that key? Ah, excellent question. Naya asked a good question that I did not go over, I love that. Um, do you need to do a key? I would say yes. It's going to be more clear if you have a key... When you look at a graph in a book, does it usually give you a key? Yeah. Excellent, so when you have a graph, you should pretty much always plan on including a, a key. Any other questions before you get started? All right before you flip your papers over and get started...
Okay, and then thirty for games, good, keep going. Movies is five so that's going to be to where? Here. Yep. Very good, now make me a key down at the bottom so I know what each color represents. Please. Mrs... Mrs...
No, it's gotta be somebody around you. Nope, somebody close to you. Marcy's not close enough. Forty dollars.
Huh?
He said, I eat nasty food, that is wrong. He's jealous 'cause he doesn't know high-quality food. What? W... We understand, Martinez. Alright. Sixty, seventy-five, perfect. All right, you've got all your percents in, you're ready to get started. What are we doing? He changed the line. Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, no.
Let's see. Chucky.
Thank you! You're welcome. What? You're welcome. Alright, how are we doing? Bad, actually. ...forty, ten, twenty, thirty, beautiful. I'm coming there next, Anna. Alright, so you got... You have... Clothes is here?
Last one, Celeste?
Alright, and then we have... what's next? Toys for ten. Thank you, again. Right here? You're welcome. Perfect. And then what do you have left? Uh, savings. My voice sounds fun... funny. Savings. Which is? Fifteen. Beautiful, that's exactly right. Is this okay, Miss Name]. I kind went outside the lines.
Twenty dollars. Okay, okay.
Milk. Olive Garden. Okay, you might treat yourself to Olive Garden. Martina? Junk food. Okay, you might go to the store and buy a whole bunch of junk food, good. Alright, next category. Brussels sprouts. Next category. Just kidding. We're gonna talk about clothing. Now you get to decide if you... We're gonna wait. You are going to decide how you are going to spend... If... How much money you want to spend on clothes.
Zero. Go ahead and put your markers, crayons down, stop where you're at. Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Max. Excellent job, Andrew. Everything down, ready to listen again. Alright, we're gonna do one last thing before we leave for success maker. I want us to take a look back at our graph.
I don't like Olive Garden. Alright, now can I call time out for a second? Are these are going to be the same blue? Alright, that's gonna throw me off, let me go get you another one. Okay, 'cause I messed up. Would that be okay? Okay. It's next to the sushi spot. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
No, borrow from somebody. Borrow from somebody.
What have we been talking about so far this week in math? Who can give me a couple of ideas of things we've discussed? Ben? Graphs. Okay, we've been talking about graphs. What kind of graphs have we explored this week? Chucky? Line graphs. Okay, we've talked about line graphs. Celeste? Bar graphs. Bar graphs. That's been most of our focus this week. At a couple of other times, we talked about some other things. Matthias? Pie graphs. Okay, we've kind of talked about pie graphs. Noah? Um, double line graphs. We talked about double line graphs.
Right, because it is an estimate... If we had done twenty percent here and five percent here, that would also have given us the twenty-five percent. The most important thing I want you to take from looking at this... Would we ever said this amount was forty-five percent? No. No, it's not anywhere near half of the circle. So that's what I want us to be keeping in mind while we're doing and making our own circle graphs. Alright, excellent job today. If you did not finish, we'll finish it for homework. I'm going to call groups to line up for success maker.
Let me see what you do. We'll make sure you get it right. Alright, so we've got... Twenty for the, um... Food.
There you go, some good sushi. I'm putting ninety in clothes 'cause I like clothes. That's fine but you have to choose...
So that's going to be your twenty. It's just not going to be... it's just not going to end on a whole line. This way? It's gonna end ther... perfect. Okay, and then...
That's okay, there's a...
What now?
an open spot? Alright, let me see you pencil. I'm not seeing it, okay. So from here, ten, twenty, thirty, forty. Five. Okay, all of that is clothes, right? Yeah. Okay, and then we've got... Books. Books.
They actually might be able to answer that from your graph, but yeah: five questions based on your graph.
Alright, what I would probably do because these are kind of hard to read... I would probably have put these off to the side. so that they would be easier to read 'cause you're going to see that done that way a lot on graphs, okay? Very nice. Alright. You okay? Take a breath. Don't you have her paper for the... You said you what?
Up to... then to here is gonna be...
But then I did fine. Alright, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred. Did you just add savings? Yeah. Oh, okay that's cool, it just threw me off. I was like, wait a second, how did we do that? Okay, I follow you, we're good, okay. So you have ten for savings. Ten for... Movies. ...movies, ten for games... five for books. And then forty. Twen... ten, twenty, thirty, forty: forty-five for clothes. And twenty for food, perfect.
Did you just notice something about where that line is? Naya? Um, each like triangle equals ten. Good, each one of these big triangles is ten. But if I needed to do like twelve. Could I stop there? Yeah, I can stop there and just draw a line, but I didn't do twelve. So I'm gonna go ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty, so...
Huh?
Okay, let's... let's do this. Start here and go around, okay? Go ahead.
So all I'm going to do on my circle graph... I have a hundred marks. I need to color in forty of those as clothes. So let me give you kind of an idea of what you're gonna do here. I'm just gonna kind of... I'm gonna start here. For my clothing. Chucky, eyes up here, please. Eyes up here. I'm gonna start here. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Yes, you may.
Isn't that food, the green one? Let's see what we're doing; alright, keep going. Alright, so then you have what?
On purpose. Say that again. You know how the sentences that have more than, like, to subtract? Mm-hmm. Um... What is the difference between the amount of money I would spend on this and the amount of money I would spend on that? What is the difference? Use some of those keywords in those sentences is a good idea.
You're on the right track, you're saying it exactly right. it's just kind of hard to explain. I think what you're... I... what I'm hearing you say is that this section will be twenty-five percent, so we have to decide, if this section is twenty-five percent, this would have to be like fifteen or twenty and this would have to be like five or ten. Okay, what... Martinez, give us what you think it would be. I think it's fifteen because if you add, uh, the green one and the, um, uh, yellow one, it equals the same as twenty-five.
She said she's a... Yeah, oh, that's on. I was just... I was just wanting to... What you did wrong, what'd you mess up on? I said it's okay, but she's not. It looks like two, it looks like ten.
Now, when we've talked about percentages all year long, what did we say was always true about percentages? They always had to be what, Max? Based out of a hundred. Based out of one hundred. Well, guess what; we're lucky today with our fractions. These are all out of one hundred, so this is gonna be pretty easy, I hope, for us to convert to percentages. Jaydon, what percentage of my money am I spending on clothes? Forty. Forty percent. What percentage of my money am I spending on books, Daniel? Thirty.
Okay? Andrew?
Yep, that works, you're exactly right. Forty-six, twenty-seven, and... You're gonna give us that tough math, let's see. Forty, sixty-six, sixty-six and twenty-four would be... Ooh, wait, hold on. Let's see, forty-six. What is this supposed to be? Um, it's someone else we could do with the circle.
Do something else, that's... We can't do that. You're gonna make a mess all over the place. Does that one work? That'll work.
with my circle graph that I do not have right now? Celeste? A title. Ah, a title and I'm not going to write it 'cause I'd end up writing way up there on the wall. Um, but I would put my title... What is a ti... And of course you can be more creative with your title that I'm probably going to be. Um, an example of a title I might have, um... How I would spend my one hundred dollars? Can we change it out for the dollar sign? Yeah you could... Well, you want to give us an idea...
One moment please. What is the least percent, how much? Okay, good. Now would you be able to answer those questions? Mm-hmm. Alright, go ahead and answer those questions, we should be wrapping it up in just a moment. Is it okay if if I put the questions on here? That's fine.
Okay, we're gonna go to lunch soon, okay? If you feel sick, let me know, okay? Especially if you need the restroom. Alright, let's see. The only thing I would recommend... Andrew. Andrew.
Alright, if we put books here. Games is how much? Twenty. Twenty, so do games from here to here. And then movies. In there. That will work out. That's where that extra five... That's where we were missing it from. That makes sense. Let me check, come on. Yeah, she was gonna be drowned.
I'm finished. Mar]... Marcy's giving you a hint. Key. And you got five questions? Alright, let's take a look. Yeah, you gotta write five questions. Do you have any white-out? No. That's okay, just put one line through it. And then write the word again. There you go, make sure your name's on it, we're just about finished.
Let's see, so ten, twenty, thirty, forty, five, perfect. Books are... Where are books? Okay. Books are five. Food is twenty. Movies are... where? Ten. And games are ten. Why did we end up with...
Alright, so you need a... A title and a...
Okay, good, hands down. Alright, you are...
Excellent, now flip it over I want you to come up with five question that somebody could answer by using your graph. Okay. Beautiful. I know, right? Like it. Alright. What is the sum of all the data? Okay, good. What does the green part of the graph mean? What is the...
Seven and twenty-four. Double-check it, I think we're about three off. Does this have to be neat, or can I leave it like that? I would like for it to be neat. I would like to always see your best work, which is usually your neatest work.
One of the papers that I've given you already has it. You don't have to worry about it; I'm gonna show it to you up here. Alright, the circle graph that I'm going to show you that is exactly like the one that you are going to turn over at your desks in just a minute. Not right now. The circle graph that you are going to get already has one hundred spots marked, okay?
Now that we've had a chance to color our own graphs, let's try to estimate what we think these percentages would be for this circle graph. Who wants to start us off? I think there's probably one that's easier than the rest of them. That's just my opinion. Martinez, what do you think? I think the... the blue one is, um... um, fifty. Alright, why do you think the blue s... ladies.
Before I move on to books what should I do? Emily? Label it? Ah, and then... Great, label it 'cause here's what's going to happen. I'm going to do books next, and I'm gonna forget which one was clothes. So I'm just going to label this as clothes for right now. And I can do one of two things. I could either put forty dollars, or I would put forty percent. And since it's a pie graph, I think we should put forty percent as our amount. I'm sorry? You could put dollars; that's showing the amount.
We're going wait and go to success maker about eleven thirty. Okay? Naya?
Biographies is the yellow section, what do you think? I think it's, like... small. Fifteen? Okay. Yeah, fifteen because... 'Cause... b... the green and the yellow is twenty-five, so if you take off like a little bit of it...
That works. Hold on, hold on, I'm just right here. Alright, so you definitely have a large clothing budget. I'll need a bigger closet. Yes, okay. That'll be in your next budget. Alright, here's what I want you to do next. Excellent job. Turn it over. I want you to ask five questions that somebody could answer from your graph. Okay? Can I put he loves clothes? Um, could they ans...
I... Forty. How much? Forty. Forty dollars out of one hundred. So my fraction is going to be forty over one hundred. Um, Celeste, help me out here. Books, what would my fraction be for books, Celeste? Um, thirty out of a hundred. Excellent, thirty dollars out of one hundred dollars. Um, and the last one. Let me get some help from Sandra. How much am I spending on food as a fraction? Thirty over a hundred. Thirty out of one hundred, Thirty over one hundred.
I can't find my mistake. What mistake? I did the wrong chart. That's supposed to be... This is supposed to be at thirty percent. I don't have nothing else that's twenty percent. Well, I'll put something at twenty percent. No, that was my games. Oh, I can change this. Yeah, I would change something to make it so... yeah. Okay. I think that would work.
If there's a certain type of toy... Oh, I left one off, sorry: books. Um, you c...
No. Clap, clap, clap. Alright. I'm going to give you about five more minutes to finish up what you can. What you don't finish in class, we'll finish for homework but take the next few minutes, get as far as you can so that I can make sure everybody has a good start to finish it at home. This are savings, this to food. I was supposed to do twenty on the games, but then I messed up.
Yeah. You get to decide which area you're gonna spend how much money. So, for example, I'm gonna choose three different categories. I'm gonna show you what I would do for my chart. You're going to get to do this in just a moment. But I'm going to show you how I might decide to spend my money. So at this point, our pencils are still down. Our eyes are still up here. I appreciate that entire second row, excellent job. Alright, so expenses.
But because we're doing a circle graph, I think it's usually better to use percentages, okay? Um, books, I'm going to do the same thing, except that I'm gonna go ten, twenty, thirty. So this section would be... Books. books. And what percentage would that be, Stephanie? Thirty. Thirty percent, excellent job. Now, am I going to color these the same color? No. No. We're going to make sure that we have two different colors, and then...
An imaginary one hundred dollars. It has to be imaginary because I am not the richest person in the world and I do not have a hundred dollars to give you. If... If I did, I would. Alright. So you have a decision to make. You have to decide how you are going to spend your one hundred dollars.
Um, you probably won't have time, but we'll see. If you... if you finish with all of it and your five questions, raise your hand and let me know; we'll figure something out. Martinez. Um, why are you spending like thirty dollars on food when I usually buy like cereal, milk, or bread? I plan on treating myself to olive garden with Naya. So I figured it might cost me a little bit more.
Eighty-five and fifteen? A hundred. Eighty... a hundred, a hundred percent, excellent job. Alright, any questions before we move on? Naya? I know it's an estimate, but at first, I was at least thinking that the green part was five. Okay. At first glance, I'm kind of leaning between five and ten percent. And Naya brought up a good point, this is an estimate, okay? Now on your charts we obviously have the little marks to show us exactly the amount, but for our purposes this is an estimate. I'm glad that you brought that up again. Ben?
Emily, help us out. Uh... We got historical fiction, non-fiction, fiction, and...? Biographies. Biographies, good. I like the fact that... Emily is answering when I call on her. Alright, so we've got four different things that are being shown here. What is the book that we have the most of in the library? You can probably tell this pretty quickly by looking at the graph. What is the book that we have the most of in the library, Lisa?
Well, three or four different colors depending on how many categories you're choosing. Then my last section... would be food. And I'm going to label this as food, and that would also be... thirty percent There's one other thing that I want us to make sure that we include when you do your own circle graph in just a minute. Any ideas on what that might be? What is one thing...
What doe we have the most of in the library? Fiction. Good, how can you tell that so easily, Noah? Because it's... it's half and all the others are not bigger than half. Good, I like... He said this is half. The other's not as big as half. But we can tell most of it is colored blue. By looking at this graph pretty simply... Do we have any numbers up here yet? No. No, but we can still tell... Andrew, what do we have the least amount of? Green.
I do not mind if you are in a whisper. But you need to be at your seats... working on your graph. If you do finish early... If you finish before we're ready to stop, I want you to turn your paper over and write five questions that can be answered from your graph. If you do not have... If you do not have colored pencils, markers, or crayons, please borrow them from somebody around you. Not from somebody across the room.
Let's do books here for this five. Then we have food, which is... twenty. Up to there. So we have from here to here so far, right? So we have ten, twenty, thirty, and you have thirty left. That's perfect, okay. So games is twenty... Ah, I see. The games was only at fifteen. That's why we were missing that five.
What are some things you notice just by looking at it? Celeste, give me one thing that you notice. That half of it is colored blue. Good, all of this side, half of this is colored blue. What is this graph about? Jaydon, what do you think this graph is showing us? Uh, it's books in the... Jaydon. Books. Books. Books what? In the library. Books that are in the library. So it's showing us... These are all the books that are in the library.
And it's showing us what parts are what different types of books. So it's showing us four different types of books. What is one type of book that it's showing us, Sandra? Non-fiction. Okay, it's showing us non-fiction books. Chase? Fiction, number one. It's also showing us fiction books.
You might decide that you only want to spend ten dollars on clothes. You might decide that you want... You saw this jacket the other day, and you really want to buy it and it's seventy dollars. You might decide to spend more of your budget on clothing. We're also going to take a look at games. What are some things...
Yeah, we have an extra one; you can use that one, that's fine. Can I get water? Okay, you just got water. Five questions about your graph. He got a... He gotta make a, um... um, make a key. Yep, you need a key and you need a...
Okay. Good, we used tally marks to help us create those charts. I like the fact that you remember that. Alright, judging by what I have on the board, what type of graph do you think we're going to be talking about today? Let's get some help from Marcy.
Putting our hands down does not mean we shout out what answer we were going to give. Oh, man. You've also got movies. If you are interested in either one of two things here. Hands down. Um, there's two different types of movies that I'm thinking here. One is if you wanted to go to the movies. The second one is if you wanted to like purchase a movie that is already and you would buy the DVD of it. So you have a couple different things to think about there. Then, finally, we've got toys.
Alright, let me take a look at it.
Yep. I see two things I'm missing. What? Just... Just one. Okay, so I'm missing your title and what else? Just that. What else? Just that. How about...
Okay. Should I put them here, she's not in here right now. Thank you. Chase, what other type of graph? I mean, I'm sorry, what other types of books is it showing us? Um. We got fiction, non-fiction. History. Historical fiction, good. Those are books that are... Historical. Tru... I'm sorry, not true, but they are based on things that still happened in history. We're missing one other type. Stephanie, what other type of book is up here?
Let's get Stephanie to help you.
Just go ahead and give me a couple of quick examples, Alexis? Cakes. I'm gonna call on those people that are being quiet and raising their hands. I appreciate that, Alexis, go ahead. Food? Yeah, what types of food might you buy? Um, bread? Okay, you might buy bread. Celeste?
Alright, what do we got so far? Add them up for me, ten... Uh, ten, forty, seventy, eight... ninety, one hundred. Excellent. Ooh, I have thirty-four dollars left.
Yeah, that's fine. Right, exactly, you wouldn't necessarily have to put what the name of it was. It's optional. See you at Olive Garden tomorrow.
How do you gotta make a key? Title, key and title. Please. Oh, like that, oh. What did you mess up on?
I got zero dollars left. Excellent, you can go ahead and start coloring if you're ready. Hm? What... There you go, Emily is going to help you out there. I'm done. Alright, cool, so let's add them up and make sure. Thirty... Uh, fifty... So do your pie graph. forty...
Time out. Purple, yellow, orange. Alright, so you got two more, keep going. Yes? Can I go to Miss Name] today? I'm gonna go get some bread. For me.
So, um, half of this is, um... will be twenty-five, too. Okay. So half of twenty-five is fifteen. I've gotta, say I agree with y'all's reasoning. I think that this is somewhere between fifteen and twenty percent and this is somewhere between five and ten percent So let's say fifteen percent and ten percent. Now double-check, let's make sure that we have one hundred percent before we move on. Fifty and twenty-five would be... Seventy-five. Seventy-five and ten would be... Eighty five. Eighty-five.
You don't... You don't have to put a lot, but you do need to have a third category that has something in it. I wanna put five.
If you're happy. If you're happy. Me and my brother eat it. If I'm in a happy mood? Yeah. If I'm in a happy mood, I'm gonna go with, um... chili lobster. Awesome. Miss Name], can you take me to Olive Garden? Can I take you to Olive Garden? Yeah, like right now. I wish I could. That would be nice.
If you had a budget of one hundred dollars for the month, and you had to decide where you were gonna spend this money, you have to pick out how you yourself are going to spend it. I'm gonna show you how I might spend it, okay? You're gonna have some different categories that you can spend it in. So you have... You have some important choices to make. First choice: you have to decide how much money you're going to spend on food for the month. What are some things that you might spend money on for food?
I'm gonna decide that I'm gonna spend money on clothes... and I'm only gonna choose three things. You have to choose at least three categories, but you can choose more if you want to. I'm also going to choose books. And I'm also going to choose fl... food for my categories. Now, the...
Show me a key.
Let me get table five. Go ahead and line up.
I... I'm gonna color the happy face. Okay, you can also decorate around the edges. Yay! That would be marvelous. Um, I like them both, so... No, which is the...
Good idea. Mm-hmm.
Can I get another sheet of paper? No, just do it on the back, this one's fine. I messed it up. It's fine. No, it's fine. Do it, how much... more money did I spend on food than clothes? But can I say first the movies? You could say how much more money did I spent on food than clothes and movies altogether. Nah. Okay. Can't I put my fun chart?
Thirty dollars on food. Say what? So, the next thing... Uh, Naya brought up a good point. It ha... Yes, it has to equal a hundred dollars. So forty and... Let me double-check. Forty and thirty is seventy, seventy and thirty is one hundred. So I'm good. I don't have to use round numbers. You could do twelve dollars or nine dollars. It's up to you as long as your total for your categories equals one hundred dollars. Next, I'm going to go to the following category. What's your question?
Say that one more time. Four of those equals one hundred. Excellent job, so basically what Andrew's saying is that this section is like one fourth of the circle, and one fourth of the circle would be twenty-five percent. Excellent job, I would agree with that. So how much have I used up so far? Seventy-five percent. I've used up seventy-five percent. So I only have twenty-five percent left. Naya, what section do you want to label for us? The biographies.
I'm going to spend... I'm gonna go with thirty dollars on clothes. No, let me go forty dollars on clothes.
Thirty percent. And what percentage of my allowance or my budget am I spending on food, Matthias? Thirty percent. Thirty percent, excellent job. Now, after we've gotten our percentages... I am going... to have an opportunity to make my own circle graph. Now, probably the hardest part about a circle graph... is splitting it into the right number of sections.
Very colorful. It's bright colors. Jaydon, Jaydon. Yes. Andrea's not in here, I can't talk to her yet. Okay, I will talk to her when she gets in here. Alright. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
The purpose of the title is to give you an idea of what your graph is going to be about. If I titled it one hundred dollars, it's a cute name, like if we are writing a book because it would pique somebody's interest. But people need to look at my graph and be able to tell exactly what my graph is going to be about. Chucky? My budget. Okay, my budget, how I would spend my one hundred dollars. Naya? My one hundred dollars will be spent on dot dot dot. My one hundred dollars will be spent on dot dot dot. Celeste?
so ninety. So fifty, ninety, and... Hey, doesn't this picture look a little bit like Pacman attacking Pacman? Harper], you're ready. No, you're fine; I'm... I'm just visually looking at what you're doing to make sure we're on the right math. Let me get the types first. Perfect, you may start coloring. I can put twenty-four cents into movies, right? How many movies you want? Yes.
Historical fiction, this green section here. Excellent job, very good. Okay, today, we're going to work on making our own circle graph. Let me tell you how we're going to do this. The first thing that we're going to do... You are going to get a chart... that looks like this. And you are going to get... an imaginary... Sorry, guys, it is imaginary.
Raise your hand if you can tell me, um... one, one type of game or one game example that you might be interested in.
Ooh, say that again.
Why do you think the blue section is fifty percent? 'Cause it's... it's half of that. Okay, excellent job. It's half. We know that fifty percent and half are the exact same thing. so we're going to go ahead and label this section fifty percent. I think that is an excellent estimate. Andrew, do you see another section that you think you would like to estimate for us? The orange one's twenty-five. Okay, what makes you think the orange one is twenty-five percent?
How many categories do you have to choose? Three. Okay. Choosing a category and putting in a zero, do you think that counts? Yes. No.
This section is going to be forty percent of my circle. Now, just like on the graph we were looking at earlier, this needs to be colored one color. Next, I have books. What should I probably do before I move on to books? Count it.
No, goodness, no. Alright, any other questions before we start? It's so cute 'cause... Any other questions? Before we start. Alright, you may begin. Do we just put a circle with percent? Say that one more time.
And uh... Twenty. Twenty, okay now hold on. Because here's what you're gonna need... here's where... here's where I think we're getting confused. You gotta do this five. Uh-huh. And then this ten's gonna bring us to what?
Good, we're gonna be talking about a pie graph. Does anybody know another name for the pie graph? Anna? Circle graph? Circle graph, why do you think we call it that? Max, why do you think... Max? Why do you think we call it that? Because it's a circle that represents, um, the, uh, amount of the sets... Okay, good, mainly because it's a circle, okay? So we have our circle graph, it's on the board.
Then don't be. Next category. Amounts spent out of one hundred dollars. If you have to start it like that, it's not gonna be good. Okay, okay. Uh-uh. Dollars spent out of one hundred dollars. Alright, so I'm gonna write a fraction. This amount would be what? How much out of one hundred did I spend on clothes?
Okay, Alexis? Grand Theft Auto. Okay, Naya?
I want to color that one, so... Hm? I want to color this. Okay.
Um, I'm just trying to double-check. Um, do we have to use all of them? Okay. Okay, excellent question. You do not have to use all of these categories. You have to choose at least... three. If you want to do every category, you can. But if you would rather ju... Let's say you know that you want to buy one book, and that's only gonna be five dollars. Include it, do five dollars on a book. Okay? Um, but you have to choose at least three categories to purchase things in.
The first thing that I'm going to do... I'm going to decide how much money I'm going to spend on each area. Now, how much money did I say that I had in all, Ben? A hundred. A hundred bucks. Alright, I have a hundred dollars in all to spend, so I have to make sure that my total is going to equal one hundred dollars, okay? I can't spend just fifty dollars total. I have to make sure the whole thing is going to be one hundred dollars. So, for example... Gentlemen.
Chase? Um, do we have to put money in the categories? 'Cause I got, um, clothes, movies, and food, and I put ninety in clothes and ten in food. Okay, That's up to you. We haven't actually started yet. Um, I'm going to put one other category up here, and this is just to give you another option. Um, we're going to do a savings category. If you would like to put some money aside to save for later, you can always put it in the savings. Any other questions before we start today? Naya?
