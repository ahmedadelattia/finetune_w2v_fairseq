okay homework everybody should have their homework out and ready to go over
you then we will go into our calendar
yesterday we started introducing division with 2 digit divisors your homework was and i modified it just a little bit remember i said do not make the model what i am checking for is the answer
make sure that you got the correct answer number one 42 divided by 15 is 2 remainder 12
number 2 49 divided by 17 is 2 remainder 15 number 3 103 divided by 25 is 4 remainder 3
number 4 65 divided by 21 3 remainder 2 number 5 35 divided by 11 3 remainder 2 number 6 128 divided by 31 4 remainder 4
number 7 93 divided by 16 5 remainder 13 number 8 59 divided by 19 3 remainder 2
number 9 84 divided by 24 3 remainder 12 questions raise your hand if you got 100 yay okay today you can put your hands down
today what i want to do is again go over a couple of examples of dividing with double digit divisors
missus r and i both showed you an example of division using estimation estimating your divisor okay i want to go over a couple more examples to show you that and make sure that you understand
that to me that is the best way to get started because double digit divisors can sometimes be tricky for students so estimate your divisor and go from there you may have to adjust up or down but at least that gives you a starting point
okay so i need everybody focused up this way and paying attention so let me give you a couple of examples
the 1st one will be yesterday we did the moon revolving around the earth how many days it took so i am going to stick with that particular lesson okay 195 divided by 32
so i am going to estimate around this 32s what should i round this number to divisor should i round to 30 or 40 30 because 2 is closer to 30 than it is to 40
correct i am going to just come down here and 30 okay remember yesterday we talked about how it is good to come to the side and do your work here will 32 go into one no what did i tell you to do with that
x will 32 go into 19 no i am going to put another x
i am going to go back to my basic math facts about how many times will 30 go into 195 or one thing that i showed you yesterday to just kind of think of it as 3 and then okay
here 30 times 6 is 180 okay so 6 times 32 we now need to do 32 6 times 2 is put down my 6 one 6 times 3 is 18 +one 19
192 subtract it out and my answer is 6 remainder 3 32 can not go into 3 what did i tell you if you get down here and your remainder is larger than your work divisor one person
you can divide more you have not divided it all the way through and that boys and girls when you use the partial quotient method that is very helpful now let me show you one using the partial quotient method
okay i will use 582 divided by 25
remember you bring that down i am going to say what do i notice 25 that is one of those really easy numbers to work with 25 50 75 100
582 i can either make this 30 and 60 or 25 and 50 or i am sorry 20 and 50
2 okay so 2 times 25 is 30 50 all i have to do is add
if i say 20 all i have to do is look at this guys 0 25 times 2 is 500 because 25 times 2 is 50 and just add your 0
okay so 500 and then i am going to put my 20 over here so 25 to me is a very easy number to work with times 3 times 25 is what 75 subtract it out
okay is my remainder less than my divisor yes so i am going to come over here and add my partial quotient my answer is 23 remainder 7
okay if you are struggling with double digit divisors partial quotient is going to be the best way for you to begin working in my opinion okay questions
model thank you for raising your hand if the number on the like the number you get after you subtract if that is higher than your divisor do you divide again yes you do
start over the problem again you do not have to because if i had gotten up here and say for instance i had just said okay 25 will go into 80 2 times
i put my 2 over here 2 times 25 is 50 and i got down here and said 32 well now my remainder is larger than my divisor so then i can put my 25 into 32 how many more times
11 more time i add my one right there subtract and then i would add these and guess what same answer 23 remainder 7 and that is the beauty of the partial quotient method
okay do you want me to do one more example of partial quotient yes no ask i am going to do one more with partial quotient you did you used the partial quotient method with single digit divisors
triple okay down now i am going to compare
how many times will 13 go into 24 either 2 13 times 2 it is 26 times once so not one but how many
10 okay 10 would be 130 then i am going to subtract and i am going to have to regroup 96 okay now about how many times i am just going to do a little thinking
estimating i can estimate this 13 as a 10 and think about that in relationship to 96 how many times do you think it might go in there 27 okay
okay did you say 9 9 times 3 is what 7 9 +one is you put a one instead of a 2 me that is too high
down how many times do you think 5 we can try 5 13 times 5 5 times 3 is 15 can 5 times 13 is 65
what you can do it again my remainder is larger than my divisor times once twice what is 13 times one 13 what is 13 times 2
2 17 remainder 5 my remainder is smaller than my divisor
that is the partial quotient method and again i strongly encourage you to start with the partial quotient method because really this way especially with the double digit divisors you can just keep working over here until you get it and then add once you get that then go to the traditional unless you want to stay with that
okay so we are going to be doing you are going to be doing some of these for homework so i want to make sure everybody understands what we are going to do right now is we are going to come over and do our calendar math stay seated until i call you over
desk please sit criss cross applesauce middle table come on
way this way over come on up you all can not bump on that okay excuse me
today again i am going to be reviewing order of operations this you will be doing a daily grade the 1st of next week over this this will be here constantly reviewing this and our order of operations
how do we remember that on pemdas do we do the e out parenthesis multiplication division addition subtraction this 1st one where am i going to start
from the division because it is what before it is what what do you notice about that parenthesis 36 divided by 4 9 now 13 +9 26
not 26 but 22 very good okay now notice on this next one i do not have any parentheses remember what i have been teaching you to take your pencil and put your parenthesis around what you are going to do 1st
since we do not have parenthesis we are going to multiplication division addition and subtraction multiplication and division unless it is in parenthesis you go left to right so what am i going to do where am i going to put my parenthesis around 63 divided by 9
63 divided by 9 is can you help us out 7 7 +45
52 okay next 11st multiply multiply what 8 times 4
s 32 okay now let us see where i am going to go next because i have got a minus sign and i have got 6 divided by 3 so what do i need to do
j do i need to put parenthesis around anything no no d since 8 times 4 is 32 subtract 6 divide it by 3 18 you subtract 18 divided by 32
back you have got a minus sign and you have got a division sign so do i need to replace parenthesis do look at my order of operations
subtraction where do i place parenthesis around the 6 around the 6 divided by 3 because if i did 32 -61st and then divided by 3 would that be correct no you have got to pay attention so 6 divided by 3 is what okay now 32 -2
30 okay so you have really got to pay attention to your pemdas your order of operations this next one you already have parenthesis what do i do 1st 4 i have got division and i have got addition
what do i do next 20 20 what divided by 4 i am going to come and place my parenthesis equals what 5 then 5 plus what equals what 6
okay so that is our order of operations yes i need you to sit criss cross applesauce questions are we going to do not today
girls ask me
seat okay
turn around please guess what we have to do today what you are going to do we have our big 20 what i am seeing order of operations on here
i am seeing addition i will wait until everybody is focused over here and looking at ms e thank you i am waiting on you
when we add and subtract fractions with like denominators who can tell me what we do what the denominator what do you do with the numerator
together then slide them over because you will not be working with uncommon denominators until the 5th grade there i will introduce it at the end of 4th grade so you will have it
not think about your basic facts with those zeros for example 500 times 3 what do you have to do 1st you take away the zeros and if you can remember what 5 times 3 is basically then then you just add a 0
how many zeros however many are in there so that was what is 300 times 5 zeros 3 times 5 is 15 then add your 2 zeros okay what about multiplying with decimals
yes i think we have done adding and subtracting okay we are going to see what you can remember from that basically you just have the same number of decimal places in your answer
okay let us see else you do have subtracting mixed numbers operations you have reducing a fraction
reducing fractions is very similar to if you have a double digit denominator here let me give you an example of that
board that can be written the same way thing 392 over 13
thing you divide your numerator into your denominator to put that in simplest form 13 goes in here how many times does 13 go into 39
3 so your answer would be 3 remainder 3 or 3 and 3 13 all you do is put your remainder over your denominator which is your divisor
yes is not it 3 remainder 2 because we have 2 leftover instead of 3 2 it would be 3 remainder 2 or 3 and 2 13
remember when i say that word and that means you have a part of a whole m we are going to go ahead and give this out what i want you to do boys and girls and i will pass out notebook paper as well show your work on another piece of paper
here some of them you will be able to do here but some of them you are going to need space like 463 times 33 you are going to need to do that on another piece of paper because you are going to need to rewrite them vertically 6 and 3 tenths times 9 again rewrite it vertically
i am going to pass this out then i will give you notebook paper as well and then i am going to pull a small group to work with on division when you finish this 1st of all you need to put your name on it in put your chairs up so ms
in this is it around i will give you notebook paper or white paper
matter make sure you transfer your answer to the big 20 sheet turn around if you can fit it make sure i can read it
i do not want all the scratching just the answer so i can quickly check it
when you finish turn it in and i also have a game on the computer right here and then i am going to put the mimio up on i have got a new weekly sheet
versatiles i have got something on the overhead projector i have not focused it so i will go focus it really quick
let me go ahead and put your homework on your board for you so you will have that when you leave and actually boys and girls your homework is the back of the sheet from last night
11.3 it walks you through the traditional method of division okay you can go back and work these out work homework reteach 11.3 problems is that you
chairs just bring your pencil and a paper
you okay we are going to start with a very simple division problem i brought some extra paper if you need it eraser 329 divided by 32
okay let us do the partial quotient so draw your line down that 32 will go into 329 how many times one it will go into 321 time but what about 329
what make it what you are going to put 329 32 times 10 is 320 okay so now what are you going to put you are going to put your not 100 but 10
subtract is your remainder greater or less than your divisor answer 10 remainder 9
k where do you put your 10 what is your answer 9 add your remainder 9
okay now 365 divided by 17 think about 17 times 10 is what
170 do you think we can go up one to 20 270 17 times i am thinking 17 times 2 is what you can use some scratch if you need to
k so can i go up one more do you think good try it 3 some out to the side and scratch so it would be what
510 is that too high 20 so 20 you are thinking 2 times 17 so 20 times 17 is what 340 good
340 then i am going to come out here and put my 20 and subtract more how many times do you think once one times 17 is 17
subtract so what is our answer you add them together your partial quotients and get your remainder
good let us do another one 325 my voice is going divided by 81
draw your line down okay i am thinking 8 times 10 8 8 times 10 is 80 in why do not you grab your materials and come over here
pencil okay so 8 times 10 or 80 times 10 would be 800 yes what about so 10 is too much
do we need to go down what do you think we are going to try if you want to 80 times 10 would be what do we need to do
6 5 4 what do you think we know that try 4 81 times 4
324 what is your remainder our answer is 4 remainder one
good what about 500 right here 549 divided by 25 quotient i want you guys to think about it and see if you can do that one on your own
s very good order of operations even though it is a little different format
what division finish that one it keeps going just do it a few more minutes
this is the same number no 136 what is 136 this if you look at your divisor you could go up one more time or however many more times
very good
more this way i am telling you it is so much easier to keep it in order let us see
25 what is one times 25 25 then all you have to do is just add what 0 what is 2 times 25 50 do it
yet 25 times 2 so if i said 20 times 25 then what would it be be what can you do right here
one i think i have got it it keep going what is it going to be not 10 but why do not you scratch that out
go back and double check that you just did it right here
all you have to do is add then what are you going to put right here
25 you just did it right over there okay you need pages on the little sticky right there very good go ahead and finish your big 20
how many times very good i want to see you do it in this format i can work with you later today
okay girls i do not have any problems for that yet so choose that you can try it
is that yours okay there is not a problem of the week
which problem did you do
that would be what not 2 but 20
27 you are telling me 800 is in there
look at those numbers 25 what is one times 25 25 what is 2 times 25
500 not 500 i give you 2 quarters how much do you have 550 you are just guessing one times 25 is 25 2 times 25 is 50
tell me why did you write 50
you just told me add those up
just the answer put an x above the 5 me put an x above the 5 erase the 24 put an x above the 5
this probably ask your mom to help you with this tonight thank you
you are doing one or the other you are not doing both
50 what is 10 times 12 12 what is 2 times 12
write it over there 12 times 2 so what is going to go there 10 times or 20 times
all you have to do is add the 0 and the 0 i am asking you how many times will it go into 148 times 10 times 12
good write it down i do not know where your notebooks are but they should be with you
take a minute to look at problem solving and reasoning and proof because those are the 2 areas that we ve been focusing on
okay is there anyone who would like to share with the entire class the problem solving what are we looking for on the rubric when we re looking for problem solving or when i m reading your exemplar and i m looking for problem solving what am i looking for for what am i looking for when i m looking for problem solving
okay so not only are you looking for the strategy i m lookin for did it help you solve the problem because if you used this to make a chart and that chart didn t help you solve the problem it s not going to help proof when i m looking for whether or not you have reasoning and proof on your exemplar what am i looking for
do i have an equation did i prove that my okay so not only do you tell me the answer you tell me why you got that answer evidence you didn t just write your answer and circle it you told me that this is how i got my answer an this is why it s correct okay this morning i gave you a little mini exemplar
i want you to go ahead and i wanted you to try and start solving it i want to give you about 5 more minutes to go ahead and with your tables you re not going to be able to get up and walk around because some of you are working with people from this morning i want you to try to look for a strategy to solve that problem and i want you to see if you can solve it with that strategy and the prove that that is your answer
you should have more than one equation on this particular exemplar
so go ahead and take the next 5 minutes with your table to talk about that exemplar and talk about that problem that you were given this morning
you guys decided instead of drawing it you re going to make a chart right where do you begin with your chart how do you know that there are 22 students okay so you said something about money
money okay so is that why you re thinking you need students in your chart too out what are you trying to find out 1st of all what do they want you to find out
we re trying to figure out which is the furthest away and how can we the taco account is $2 and the basketball account is $4 and can it be spent they can only spend one per student do you think your chart s going to help you figure that out
out it may be more of an equation why do you think more of an equation it can help you think equally so we can put 2 equations next to each other
what was that one about the remainder no we can t change the students in the problem because it will make it easier for you yeah that was the object
yes were you working on your own or were you all working together
is 8 still 0 is there any kind of limit on money you can spend
$22 how do you know that because it says that you can spend one for each student okay so are you sure that you re not going over $22 when you use that method no cause they re sharing and it makes it okay so your strategy is to make this simpler but do you know how much money if you were to get is this your balls right here
balls remember to label it that how much is 4 balls balls are those see i don t know when i read this i m not quite sure because i m focusing on your problem solving and your reasoning and your proof i want to make sure your proof is showing me
$8 number 2 represents a dollar amount is that what you re saying and the 4 represents the balls
that so far you ve spent $8 on basketballs so you re going to spend the rest of the money on soccer balls
money i see how you re dividing up the balls but okay this is confusing me a little bit you said something about this money
what money but are we supposed to split this money up do yes you would like to do that
that you re saying that what are you saying
so you re saying that you want to get the same amount of balls for each group and they can alternate no what i m saying is i want to take this money and split it between these okay this is the money that okay of both this is the money that like basketballs this is the money so you took the money and split it no that s what i was i had that s what you re thinking about doing
yeah because i ve already done this and got balls for them and i was asking what do you think
okay so explain why you think it would be all right these people have can you explain that to me on paper
reasoning all right i think it s been a little bit more than 5 minutes now this is what i want to do a little bit differently than we ve been doing so far i m going to model my thinking on the board and then what i want you to do is to record my thinking thinking so flip your paper off off flip your papers over and just record some of the thoughts that i have
you re not going to be able to keep up and record every thought that i have but i just want you to record something things as much as you can catch of my thinking thinking i m talking around from table to table and i m seeing that lots of you have different thoughts on this
lots of you have lots of reasons to back up your answers and i really like that i m seeing that yours certainly because from table to table i m seeing different thinking and different reasons so what i want to do is model for you my thinking and you just write down the facts
disagree whether you re thinking 0 i never though of it that way write no
the problem said that i want to buy playground balls for our class true pretend like i gave you a survey that said 5 of the students like soccer balls 8 students like basketballs and 9 students like both
chart then as you went a little bit further excuse me let me talk about my thinking not yours i thought about this and i thought yeah this would be a great idea to make a chart then as i went further where it says i know i can spend a dollar per student and i know that soccer balls cost $2 and basketballs cost $4 the main question is what is the fairest way to purchase the balls how can we spend the most money that i possibly can
so what i decided to do 1st was write in an equation because i needed for me i needed to start with the money 1st thought i was thinking i need to figure out how much money i m dealing with
so what i decided to do was it said that there were 22 students so on my paper i said i ve got to label that 22 students times and i m going to put a dollar sign money per student that so i find out that i can spend $22
now even though i know that $22 times one is pretty simple i still want to show that so my reader understands what i m thinking
total i can spend this amount
problem so i said okay 5 students like soccer balls i m going to go ahead and write in my chart 5 students and i m going to write 5 soccer balls now some of you went across i m making mine down
so what do i need to do to multiply if the soccer balls cost $2 i think i m going to go ahead and see if i can buy soccer balls for those 5 students
guys wow so 5 times 2 is $10 and i only have $22 to spend see let me put that over here in my thinking
not so i know that $10 is what it s going to cost me for soccer balls because 5 sb s times $2 would cost be $10 money 8 students like basketballs so let me see
$4 that s 8 students like basketballs but they re $4 each $320 my gosh
so i wouldn t be able to buy enough soccer balls if i was supposed to buy 5 soccer balls i want to be able to buy basketballs for everyone if everybody gets a soccer ball here and everybody gets a basketball here that s really not fair
$22 if i go half and $22 in half is about $11 each but that would mean i d get 5 soccer balls and only 2 basketballs but more students like basketballs
so now i m thinking that i need to make it more fair so maybe i need to spend if more students like basketballs and basketballs cost let me write how much they cost because i keep having to go back to my answer okay basketballs cost $4 and soccer balls cost $2
so i think what i might do is buy 3 basketballs because 3 times $4 is $12 and that s about half so i think i m going to do 3 basketballs so 3 times $4 equals $12 so that s 3 basketballs that are $4
so if i did 3 here and then if i were to buy let see the other half of the money but wait a 2nd what about those students who like both shouldn t i divide it by 3 groups let me think okay so 22 divided by 3 because i only have 2 groups
so 3 times 7 is 21 and i have a remainder so i should spend about $7 on each group and that makes it fair because i m spending the same amount on each group so if i were to spend about $7 on soccer balls and about $7 on basketballs and $7 on both what could i get
the soccer balls cost $2 so i could get about 33 soccer balls because soccer balls cost $2 $6 that s close to $7
these cost $4 and i can spend $7 but 08 students like that but i can really only get one because $4 times one equals i m sorry yeah $4 times one equals $4 with a remainder of $3 left over
this one has a remainder of one but they re getting 3 soccer balls and they re only getting one both students 9 students like both well gosh if i have 9 over here i could divide these into these 2 groups and that could make it even because i have $7 and half of $7 is about $3.50
so if i put half of the students let s say we put half would be 8 remainder one i mean 4 remainder one so if i put 4 students over here and i put 5 students over here i could get one more basketball and then i d have money left over but that wouldn t make it fair to this group cause more kids like basketballs
so i really have $7 plus $3 which is $10 that means i can get 2 more basketballs if i put all the money here then there would be 3 basketballs and 3 soccer balls but really i don t know how many of these students let me think
so this would be 3 and 3 but if i took one away i could do 2 times 2 and that would be 4 and then i would have 3 left over here
so if i ve got 2 balls here i ve got one ball here hat moved this money over here so that would mean that i could get 3 soccer balls or 3 basketballs because 3 times 4 is $12 and i m spending $4 over here
so that would mean that i would have $16 and how many would i have left is 6 $6 so i could really get another basketball i could do 4 over here and that would be $16
that would make this be $18 then i could do because i have $4 leftover i could get 2 more basketballs but that would bring me up to an even amount but i can t afford i only have $4 left i can t get another basketball and i really don t want to get them just one so what i ll probably 2 is get 2 more soccer balls
so i ll probably get 4 soccer balls and 4 basketballs to make them about even if i did 4 basketballs times $4 each that would be $16
if i did 4 soccer balls times $2 each no wait there so 2 times 4 would equal $8 $16 plus $8 equals $240 that s too big
$22 so i m going to have to take away a soccer ball and that would mean that i would buy one soccer ball times $4 and $16 +4 equals $20 and i have $2 leftover
change i m sorry okay so that would make it okay i m lost myself here $2 times what 3 would be $6 rather than $8
okay so i can get 3 soccer balls and 4 basketballs 4 times 4 is $16 for basketballs and $6 for soccer balls 6 +6 is $12 $22
so it makes sense for me to buy 4 basketballs and 3 soccer balls because i ll spend all the money a 0 yes thank you readers so therefore i now will spend $22 $16 on basketballs $6 on soccer balls now i m going to proofread it and make sure that i have it communicated to my person
the strategy i used was kind of a guess and check i would say check i used a combination of a chart and an equation yeah but i think i did a lot of guess and checking because i was going back and forth to try
so i think the strategy i used was guess and check
here i did a little over here where i made some computation mistakes page did i follow a straight line did i go back and forth
do now i want you to turn your paper over and i want you to talk with your table now about the differences between my thinking and how you saw me stumble and your thinking so talk about your thinking versus my thinking
what were some of the things you noticed about my thinking that is was much easier that you wrote down everything that it was easier to solve and easier for us to read did i do you ever do that when you solve a problem
yes if you get lost it s not the end of the world you can just start over did i have to start over though no you were just going back it s just a way of showing what you re thinking
yeah and that was that s a very good point question times 2 is soccer ball students like soccer i m sorry you what was the difference in your thinking versus my thinking
i actually found out that was right what was different about it how you would have got it versus how i would have got it
it i did the money 1st i tried to figure out how much money i could spend on each and then i figured out i just found the number so i added one more basketball so you went over like me with the $18 and you went backwards like i did to the $16
do you notice anything different student k
so you ended up you started out with $22 and you you didn t get to the money part dividing it up with the basketballs and soccer balls yet right did you want to take something home no how was your thinking different than my thinking
you wouldn t did you get was anyone able to come up with i did
what about you since you guys came in late did you get to the point where i got did you follow it or was it confusing it was confusing
you 0 okay you do you have any questions for me i see you have a chart started so you didn t start before we even started then
so you didn t have a lot of background on this problem to begin with did you can you go back and look at the board and start writing some things down to help you tables what did you notice that was in my thinking versus your thinking
lot i mean you didn t change a lot but you did okay so what did you guys get to that point too before i can i se how far you guys got compared to how far i got
information you knew you had $22 to spend so you kind of started like i did but you didn t write it in a chart all right give me 5
after coming around i noticed that a lot of you started out like i did where you started out with the $22
the tables that i was able to visit we were talking about the difference in thinking information was there anything i didn t get to your table was there anything that you noticed that was different than what we talked about
comment that some people they only use like one soccer ball but it does depend on what happens to them you wouldn t want yeah because sometimes we don t really want one game sometimes people get because we have quite a big field
yes you also think of how many people are going to play that game at one time so this problem s a lot of an opinion and you got to think of how many people are going to do something in order to actually be able to understand and comprehend that s a good point i tried to modify this problem from a bigger problem that you re going to solve in just a minute
so you can go about doing that and looking at your problem solving strategies but that s very true when you re looking at the big picture it s just like interpreting the remainders of something you ve got to look at the whole situation and we re talking about with the buses if you re going to have 100 kids going on a field trip and each bus only holds 35 kids you re going to have a remainder and you can t just leave those kids back you ve got to order another bus
so you re kind of thinking about the logistics of the problem i m going to go ahead and give you the exemplar and i want you to take a look at it before we let you work on it independently question no you re going to again focus on that problem solving strategy and then proving your reasoning
then said one of the things i should have done is labeled sb and ss students soccer balls and students basketballs or make a key somehow so yes i would need to go back and proofread this one more time so that s an example of me modeling for you that one of the things is you keep going even when you you don t go back to the very beginning i didn t go back to the beginning and also tonight have someone proofread it
if they can t understand what you used to solve it and why you have that answer then you need to show some more so that reader can understand that question what is the basketball but again i don t have time right now but i want you to go ahead and this is your exemplar for tonight
good morning good morning morning work is on the board you need to have your math notebooks out and your math student activity books you need to sit there for right now please you have to turn that way
in the thing i am sorry my notebook is in the blue thing i do not know what to tell you a why is this table you need to get your math notebooks sit down please where are you going
watch your fingers what is the team do not worry about that page we are just doing the one that says morning work i need to you to sit down has started started table 4 has started
yes i understand that but that is okay
paper get up and get a piece of paper and stop whining just grab your notebook and you can sit at table 3 morning
yes are you going to give us i can not hear you are you going to give our package on decimals so everybody at this point should be settled
d keep working we are not drawing pictures we are doing our math you did 9 times 2 is 18 the one here
54 plus the one was 55 so what i would do here is you take you put the 50 the 5 is come down because then we are done with the one is right so then we put in 0 and now we have to do the 10 times both of those numbers
that what is 9 times 6
55 yeah
yes i still can not get said about me yesterday during tutoring yeah you do not remember what he said was it a big deal or he was joking no we will talk about it later
yes what would you get i think you are good what is 3 times 6 is your mom going to be excited just a little bit or a lot
i explained to her who there we are not she is telling me to be quiet and well she needs you to be quiet so she can do her work
go sit at be quiet go sit at table 3 work so put the 0 then you do 3 times 2 is 3 i am sorry 6
18 then you add
i am sorry how do you like so you use the data at the top and you find the maximum which that is an easy one to find mode i am not really sure look up there where it says mode on the green cards
capitalized right what did i say that that meant median the one in the middle and then mean mean is like average
is well do the ones you do know and then we will go from there let me see this 39 from 0 i see what you did
30 times let me see your pencil 30 times 2 goes in this box wrong i just have to put the numbers across the top and then across the side
oops i am sorry so this one was 30 times 60 so for this one you take the one this length here it is like finding area right so we take this length which is 30 and this which is
60 what is this one 2 is 0 this is 9 39 2 and what is this one 9 so then do it that way and then fix this one to do it the same way only because what you are doing is you are putting in the 9
this is confusing because it is 79 so the 70 goes on top and the 9 goes on the bottom and you use just these 2 and these 2 for all 4 of the boxes
yes sorry we have got it is so this right here is 60 times 2
so then if you i think what you are saying is if you know 60 times 2 is 120 then you can do 60 times 20 which is what which is 1400 200 right but then you still need another 10 because you only had 20
so which would be another 600 which is going to give us a total of 1800 right yeah so so far we are at 60 times 30 equals 1800 and so now you still need to do the 60 times 9 and then 2 times the whole thing
about one more minute
let me see this can i turn this 12nd so you have 0 0 0 8 +8 is 8 10 and 8 +one is 9
11 good range what is the range it see i will tell you that it has to do with maximum and minimum does that help
more you add them up so if i said i am trying to think of how i could use range in a different way
distance so what is it has to do with maximum and minimum and it has to do with distance
down you are on the right track back table one stop talking and do your work 16 where did this come from the 101 or what is that a 101
from when i did like that 62 times 9
9 do you know what 6 times 9 is no what is 9 times 5
45 and so 6 times 9 is 9 more 45 i will be right there
pencil why do not you take one of the black ones off my desk cause that one is very little that you are using 54 so if 9 times 6 is 54 what is 9 times 60
540 and then what is 2 times 9 18 so you have to add those together and that would be what goes here job finish up what you are writing
writing i am going to give all of you a post it note and i want you to stick a post it note on that page so i can correct that during lunch
so wednesday when we were in math on wednesday we were talking about decimals yesterday we did not have math because we had our science fair but who remembers what we were doing or talking about on wednesday when we talking about decimals l we were putting decimals we were putting them on a number line
doing do you want me to ask someone else l sitting them in order from least to greatest and how were we trying to determine which was the least and which was the greatest and what went in between
n we looked at the things which was one was bigger cause we so what were we looking at to see what was bigger j we were looking at the place value of the digits to determine which of the decimals were greater and which were less and to put them in order from 0 to a whole
on wednesday i told you that we were going to sort of step away from looking at that and we were going to look at something else and what we are going to do today is we are going to look at the relationship between fractions and decimals
so if i say to you that i have this fraction here how do you read this fraction mean if i have a fraction one half what does that tell me
k like say if you have a whole closet full of something i do not know shoes or whatever then if you take half of them out then half of them will still be in there so then i could have a whole bunch of shoes in a closet in a closet and i take and you need space so you take out half of them what do you mean to take out of half of them and leave half
if it is an even amount then you could split in half and take one half out so you can so can i give you an example 9 so that means that there are equal amounts in my closet as outside of my closet me in the fraction one half what does the 2 tell me
j that there is 2 that there is 2 groups 2 groups line what is the word we use for this number at the bottom of the line
j you are taking one half of taking half of the denominator i am taking one of the denominator one of the 2 groups in this case and what do we call this number that is on top of the line numerator a while back when we were talking about fractions we talked about the fact that a fraction represents one of the 4 operations
and the 4 operations are addition subtraction multiplication and division what operation does a fraction represent addition does it represent subtraction multiplication or division this is your last warning
division so i read this fraction as one half but i also know that this 9 here tells me something about division 2nd who knows the decimal equivalent for one half if i wanted to write one half in a decimal what would it be
l one decimal 2 says one decimal 2 no good try who else has an idea of how i could write one half in a decimal
2 the other way
half why is 0.5 or said 5 tenths why is that representative of half
l it is representative of half because if you know how you say it it is like 5 tenths 5 and half of 10 thank you so says when you say actually it sounds more like this does not it like a fraction 5 tenths and we know that 5 tenths is half because the numerator is half of the denominator
about i am going to hand you each a calculator and i want you to think about how could you use the calculator to figure out that one half is 0.5 in a decimal how could you use the calculator i want you to try it
it how do you think you could prove on this calculator that one half is equal to 0.5
is that not working that is what i am asking you
it it proves that 5 tenths +5 tenths equals a whole which means this must be half and this must be half now i am going to ask you a different similar but different question 12nd there is no decimal yes there is like that similar question but a little bit different
a minute ago somebody told me that this represents division that you did me said this represents division can you use division to prove on your calculator that one half is equal to 0.5
can you use division to prove on your calculator one half is equal to 0.5 yes you have it
does what so prove to me that these 2 are equivalent check with
thinking check with see what he is thinking
it anybody so if one half represents division so if we do it but you do something with one half half no
that is a decimal i want you to work with one half
divided half i am going to do 5 divided by who has an idea down eyes to the front please
thinking for to get to to get to 0.5 0.5 25 times 2
here 0.25 divided by we are using just one half you told me this is representative of division
division i knew that because of so if i wanted to save this i am not just asking and i am asking everybody to be looking at the front board please if i want to say one half in a division problem what do i say
division so i say divided by j said he thinks it is one divided by 2 calculator one divided by 2 one divided by 2
to multiple students 0.5 0.512nd cause it is still a half
here when we get one divided by 2 we came up with 5 tenths 0.5 right yeah cause this is the short way of saying one divided by 2 and back when we 1st started talking about division if we had come across a problem that said this a lot of people said no no no you can not do that
because you got to use your decimal table 2 why did people think we could not do this r this was back when we were talking about division a couple months ago
think one divided by 21 half it is one divided by 2 and one divided by 2 so if i have one item and i have 2 people and i take this one item they are each going to get one item
no they are going to get one half of the item they are going to get one half of the item so back when we started talking about division you said to me we can not do this and i think what was happening was you were thinking if we do this we are not going to have a whole number right that you can divide you can have a problem that looks like this but you are going to end up having a decimal or a fraction as an answer
different i did 10 divided by 20 it equaled the same and then i did 100 divided by 200 got the same thing and you did 5 divided by 10 yeah why is that all coming out to 0.5
observation why is that all coming out to 5 tenths or 0.5 there why when put in 5 divided by 10 and put in 10 divided by 20 why did that all come up to 0.5
so what did i cut in half the bottom numbers the denominators all of the denominators are cut in half so if they are all equal to half then it would make sense they would all have the same decimal does not it
j
so no matter what numbers you put in if the 1st number you put in is half the 2nd number you put in you are going to end up with 0.5
i did that did you want to add something i did it with a 3000000 and you still came up with 0.5
j they said it is all divided by cause everybody is using these numbers that are ending in zeros
12 what if it was 6 twelfths is it 0.5 still hand because why half because it is still half now i have listed here some middle school basketball teams and their records
there are 5 teams the dragons the vikings the falcons the eagles and the bears what does the w mean if this is their record and it is a basketball team j win wins
d losses teacher and then the record at how many games did the dragons win 29 how many games did the dragons lose
did we said if you have a fraction and you divide the numerator and by the denominator you end up with a decimal 0.725 could somebody read this as a number
j 725 thousandths so we just say 725 thousandths good how many show me on your hand what number is in the hundredths place show me on your hand what number is in the hundredths place
stop playing with the calculator and answer the question please down show me on your hands what number is in the thousandths place 5 good so who can tell me what place the 7 is in
j tenths excellent the tenths i want you to think about what we did with one half to get to 0.5 to look at the record of the dragons and see if you can figure out where 0.725 came from
if they won 29 games and lost 11 games where did 0.725 come from out what is the question i am sorry so then you are not doing something quite right i am going to repeat it one more time
you are looking at the dragon is record of 29 wins and 11 losses and see if you can figure out with a calculator where 725 thousandths came from thinking about what we did with one half m so 29 because why because it is how many wins and why 11
so when we talked about one half what did the 2 tell us how many how many how many how many groups so if the 2 tells us how many groups how many games did they play all together if we are talking about one half
29 no half if i told you that they won half their games and just looking at the fraction one half how many games did they play all together
this they won 14th of their games how many games could you think that they played they won one out of how many so when you are telling me you are doing 29 divided by 11 you are telling me they won 29 and it seems like they played only 11 games
what are we thinking over here come so 29 tells us what
29 and what are you are going to divide that by why cause that is how much they lost so if i told you that they played 4 games and they won one what fraction would that be no 12nd
saying so you are saying to me can i just write on something you are saying to me that they won that if i tell you this it means they won one out of 4 games this so they won 29 out of 11 games
no so go with that thinking they lost 11 games they only played 29 games many you put 29 +11 that is the total number 0 something so talk here so come here and tell me what you were thinking
can i use the bathroom when comes back i did divided by well i want you to use the 29 and the 11 the wins and losses to get to 0.7252nd so what did you do for this
11 so if i told you guys look over here if i told you guys that they played 4 games and they won one game what fraction did they win 14th 14th does the 3 matter no so you guys are saying to me they won 29 out of 11 games no they only played 11 games and they won 29 of them no
0 is onto something is onto something is onto something if i told you that they played 4 games and they won one what fraction did they win
does it matter about the it is 14th win 11 out of 20 i mean one tell me about it
so they won 29 out of 11 games so they only played 11 games and they won and they won listen to what i am saying me go sit down go sit down they played 11 games and they won 29 is that possible
11 you play sports right if you told me i won 29 games and lost 11 games and i said to you how many games did you play all together how would you figure that out so your game you played a number of games that we do not know how many there are
but i am saying that in this mystery basketball team you played a number of games and we do not know how many there are them how many games did you play all together
40 why i added 29 and 11
so let us see what we came up with and let us talk about the wrong ways too cause it is great to get the right way but we have a lot of wrong ways 1st what was your thinking in the beginning when you 1st sat down with the calculator and you tried the 1st thing what was the 1st thing that you tried what was the 1st thing that you tried i am going to call on someone as soon as i hear that everybody is listening
d like this
d that the answer would be 725 thousandths and why did you think why were you thinking that
because it would not be dividing it times cause it would have to be cause since there was 29 let me ask you this question
were you thinking about using decimals here because you knew that your answer was going to have a decimal and that the idea of having 2 whole numbers would not get you to a decimal who else wants to share what their 1st thinking was j yeah
i did 29 11 most people did this l it came from how many games they won how many games they won where did the 11 come from
d how many games they lost when you did 29 divided by 11 what did you come up with for an answer on the calculator with what was the answer on go what was the answer on the calculator
when you did 29 divided by 11
0.666666 2.66 and a whole bunch of 6 is
no 6363
waiting what was the thinking behind 29 divided by 11 when you 1st did 29 divided by 11 what were you thinking i keep seeing the same hands people at table 2 your effort grade is not where it should be right now
go what were you thinking i said when you 1st did 29 divided by 11 what was the thinking around that 11 cause because there were 29 wins and 11 losers and 11 losses
so then we started to think about something else and said that after that he said 29 divided by 40 thumbs up if you finally came to 29 divided by 40
not where does this 40 come from where does the 40 come from
mean they had to play together they are adding what did you add 29 +11
up i understand that today is the last day before vacation and there is a lot of excitement and you are ready to be done but we still have 6 hours of school left done and then you will have 9 days of freedom but we are still going to work through
you are about 15 minutes from math being over so let us just plug through the rest of this participate so that we can have the rest of the day to get accomplished what we need to accomplish so that we can go home for vacation from and said i added 29 +11 why why did they add 29 +11
purpose table 2 you are not participating right now d the number 40
11 and then i said you added see how much games they had to get so here is what this is what i heard as i walked around and tell me if this is what you sort of started to come to when people said to me 29 divided by 11 i said okay
so the dragons won 29 out of 11 games yeah then i said so they played 11 games and they won 29 then everybody said that is kinda not possible can not play 11 games and win 29 of them what do you want to say
they were supposed to win 40 games but the total number was 29 so they played a total of 40 games and when we make a fraction what goes on the bottom r of what what you need to say something the number of what
the number of games they won the number of games they lost together so the denominator tells us how many they won all together anybody want to help
us the denominator tells us the total amount the total amount of groups or total amount of something games and how many games did they play all together
40 in this case we are talking about their winning record cause who wants to talk about your losing record have so what is going to go on our numerator if we are talking about a winning record what is going to go in the numerator in there if we are talking about the winning record
what wins so we are going to put the number of wins on the top so 29 wins out of a total of 40 games 11 what do you do with the 11 it in this case we do not talk about it
if we said i want to know what the losing record is instead of doing 29 out of 40 what would i do if i wanted to talk about the losing record instead of doing 29 divided by 40 what would i do
r what what numbers 29 11 divided by 40 so because we are only talking about the winning record we are going to just use this 11 to figure out how many games in all
so here is what i would like you to do in your notebook on the next page i want you to go through and see do the same thing for vikings falcons eagles and bears 2nd how can you use your calculators to determine this record and i am a little sort of a little asterisk to that
i am going to tell you that some of your decimals when you do the division look at me some of them are going to look exactly like these different i want to know if it looks a little bit different how did we get to these particular numbers
me the directions are in your notebook you are going to write the fraction that you used to get to this record and i want you to think about if it does not look exactly like this on the calculator but one number is off or 2 numbers are off why
question let me come there in 12nd is this how addition and fractions go addition fractions go with decimals decimals i just did here i come
it i did 13 divided by 26 and it equals 0.5 record how many wins 26 how many games 13
games they lose 13 can you wait 5 minutes can you wait 5 minutes how many games did they play 39 in all i did that part i did this so what did you do
i did 26 divided by what did you do to get that i did 26 double check i did 26 divided by divided by that is percent 26 divided by 40
7 so what i want you to do is write down the fraction you did which is 26 over 39 write that down and then i want you you can go onto the next one me can you worry about you please
you can go onto the next one but i want you to think about where did that 7 come from in the record here down so i can not come over there and say let us see what you tried
do i added 26 to and got 39 divided by 26 26 so here is my question
games what did they they 26 games out of backwards you did 39 divided by 26 which is this fraction
39 over 26 which means they won 39 out of 26 games which if you only played 26 games you can not win 39 right so write that down and then we are going to figure out where did that 7 come from see their record up there
0.667 this you are having lunch detention today between drawing laying in your seat and not participating i am not need to tell you more than once and i had to tell you more than once so what is the fraction of winning to total games
they won like 26 26 you have the right numbers
go did they win 39 games out of a total of 26 or did they win 26 games out of a total of 39 try it is a little bit different
different that is pretty much the same right right so we have to figure out why there is a 7 there but we have got those 2 6 is right what is the deal i am coming
we are not winning so what are can we wait 5 more minutes we will be done in 5 minutes what are you dividing i am trying to get the number 667 sit up
i am going to do 50 divided by 12 but where is 50 and 12 from up there on the vikings nowhere what do we have over here divide 39 divided by 26
win so that is the numerator do 26 was the numerator you have nothing written down
denominator so how are we going to divide 39 divided by 13 39 so what are we 26 divided by 39 26 divided by 39 cause it is numerator divided by denominator
you are right and we are going to talk about that in about 10 seconds table what do we have over here
i got a little you got i added the number that was on the screen and i got 668
j what did you do falcons yeah so did you do 38 divided by 21
1st eyes up here in 5 4 3 2 one
vikings before we talk about the kind of confusion that is coming up what is the winning record in a fraction what is the winning record for the vikings in a fraction
39 what does this fraction mean which number tells me how many they won
26 so this tells me they won 26 out of 39 yes yes so then when you divided 26 divided by 39 what did you come up with
0.66666 and it keeps going forever and ever and ever and ever yes how come this says 667 thousandths if the answer on the calculator looks like this because it is 6 sevenths how did this what happened here
cause it is 6 sevenths maybe because it is 6 sevenths thing maybe they just what is that word when you estimate round rounding so you round in this case to the thousandths place
so we go to the thousandths place which is the 6 here and we look to the right in the 10 thousandths place if the number in the 10 thousandths place is 5 or above what happens to this number bigger it goes up
stays so i say 5 or more let it soar rest so is this number greater than 5 or less than 5 greater 6 is less than 5 greater 6 it becomes a what a 7 7 we round up to 7 and that is where this 667 thousandths came from
right 76s but because we rounded down eyes up here
if you are a sports fan and you go to the newspaper and you go to the sports pages you might actually see something that looks like this for a high school team or the batting average for the red sox see and a lot of times people say that i am never going to use that teacher why do i need to learn it but in this case this is something especially if you are a sports fan
too but this particular exact item you could find in the sports pages here what we are going to do when we return from vacation is a couple of things we are going to work with this for another day on finding or converting decimals to fractions and fractions to decimals then we are going to move into adding and subtracting decimals which will eventually lead us to multiplying and dividing them
so what i am going to ask you to do while you are on vacation is nothing that is a packet this whenever you see a decimal throughout the week that you are off either write down what you saw or bring it in so if you see a decimal in the newspaper bring that piece of paper in cause i want us to see how often we can find decimals in our every day life
so what is it i am asking you do to over vacation please what is it that i am asking you to do over vacation if you see a decimal bring it in s anywhere you see a decimal bring it in whether you bring in the actual item or you have written down a list of places you have seen it
more the batman lego game they have decimals in that game on the batman lego game doing i would like you to close your notebooks make a pile in the middle of the table of your notebooks
and is going to come and collect those piles and put them on the back table please and then we are going to do a stand and stretch so stand behind your chairs please
this let s get on the side that says 84 side all right we re finding the volume of the figure so we said that if each one of these cubes represents one cubic unit of volume take a look at that picture right there
that picture is going to be how many cubic units then what s the answer to that what cubic units 12 cubic units so everything that you answered should have been in what cubic units everything that you answered should have been in what cubic units everything you answered should have been in what cubic units okay i just wanted to make sure that everybody understands that
issue is i m walking around and i don t see where most of you wrote down cubic units numbers what are these pennies skittles m m s yo yos you need to make sure you have given me cubic whatever it is units okay not the number you can t put you have to be careful also
so for instance if one of your answers happens to be 12 and you are telling me it s 12 cubic units you can t do that units you could write if you wanted to write out units and then put a 3 off of the units that s fine
this that is totally different volume give me the volume let s start c what s the volume for number 18 cubic units 8 cubic units okay number 2 what s the volume there going around j
18 cubic units all right number 320 cubic units
a 11 cubic 11 cubic units question how did you get 11 you got the length and the width and then you got the you counted the top like you went from here to here to here to here okay question i m going to back up just a tad bit
h what s l
no why does not length times width times height automatically work on number 4 because you got a flat spot right here like while you are counting up this flat part here curves okay he s telling me that the bottom is flat but then you ve got some that are on top that are additional
is there another explanation that you can give me of why you wouldn t just automatically say length times width times height anyone else want to explain my question is could you do it though yes how because what s not there okay what would i need to do to this item
what would i need to do to it to be able to use that formula just use the regular formula and then after that just add them okay but okay listen to me though if i do the regular formula what s going to mess me up up the top part
why okay basically what s missing here what s missing g you look at your picture everybody take a look at number 4 put your finger on it
what s missing take a look at the picture and i m just asking you a simple question what s missing there yes a the height okay can you find the height here though yes but what s missing that should be here that s going to keep you from automatically saying length width height i m done
what s missing you have a flat surface on the bottom that like it needs to be flat so okay so that means that it needs to be what here i think that what s confusing me is when you say flat surface
because the bottom is flat yes the top isn t flat so it s hard to like count it because on the 1st 3 it s flat but on number 4 it s like going up like part of it s flat and other parts not
missing that s making it one whole nice complete rectangular shape missing basically what i want you to see is you have pieces that are missing so if i break it apart though imagine breaking it apart could i figure out the volume yes okay take off the top part
it and if i just told you to find the volume of the bottom which is flat what would that be
be 9 but what would the measurements be that you would need to multiply
11 you ve got to figure out what if you just found out the volume for the flat surface right there dividing you divide 2 and 9 and i think 9 find the volume yeah it if you are breaking it apart you are tearing something apart
part find the volume of the 2nd part take a look at what the piece that you just took off what s the length what s the width 30 wait a minute what one okay the part that you just took off the part that you just took off
be 2 what s 9 times 19 part yes what was the volume of the 1st flat part
numbers add them now i can add them together what s 9 +2 shape 1111 cubic units 11 cubic units 2 ways you can work it one just go through and count apart and find the volume of each section each complete section
remember that formula that you guys learned length times width times height only works if you have a cube a solid cube or a solid rectangular prism prism you can t use a formula like ms yes okay i think some of you were trying to do that you were trying to use a formula without breaking it apart and then putting it back together per se all right let s take a look at number 5 what did you get i can t remember where i stopped
you what is my volume on number 5 i got 9 cubic units all right how many of you got 9 cubic units on number 5 okay who can tell me how he got 9
out he did he did length times width times height okay if you did length 3 width 3 height 31 height height would be 11 because you didn t do the other side possibly
that it s not a whole complete rectangular prism that s filled in it s like you have some points you have some that are sticking out that are missing next can you tell me what the answer is number 6
pennies cubic units 18 cubic units yep yeah okay yes a you don t see how he got 18 cubic units no i got it i got it okay number 6 c what did you get as your volume 12 cubic units
0 another way he could have gotten 27 is if you multiplied 3 times 3 times 3 that s what i thought he did because that s what he got 27 but he told me one and i went that s what i thought 0 he got 9 okay that s what i that s what i was thinking in my head that he got 27 so i was thinking 3 times 3 times 3 we were just in that aspect i guess
all right number 7 let s take a look volume pretty simple they give you the length they give you the width they give you the height so coming around the mountain j what s my volume 24 cubic centimeters 24 cubic centimeters i didn t have cubic yeah that one didn t have to be units this was actually going to be centimeters 24 cubic centimeters number 8 what is my volume k
10 cubic centimeters any question about that one l 36 cubic centimeters yes 36 cubic centimeters questions no nope good job all right let s flip it over to the back i didn t get 6 okay this is where we go
okay you all let s just double check and make sure we have all the same answers because what starts happening is i got this this i didn t get this and i got this and i didn t get this so let s just double check very quickly make sure we are all on the same page all right number one what did you get e cubic meters what s the volume 54 cubic meters
54 cubic meters n what about b on number 164 cubic meters 64 cubic meters aj 162 cubic meters all right number 2 a how many cubic centimeters
1181805 you should have decimals somewhere in there a 0 i forgot to put the decimal so where should it be 18.85 thousandths hundredths not 85 and then you told me point
back 18 it s not 85 hundredths what did you get c 18 and 75 hundredths you should have gotten 18 and 75 hundredths just a 10th off it seems all right number 2 b what did you get
b 894 millimeters 894 and 6 tenths all right and number 3 i mean number 2 c what did you get a
mean 18 you had it right 1800 cubic units 1800 cubic meters all right find the volume number 3 how many cubic meters a 210 cubic meters
e skittles m m s what centimeters 0 cubic meters cubic centimeters
w 614 and 125000 cubic millimeters thank you c 232 and 128 thousandths cubic centimeters thank you excellent job all right do me a favor pass this down to the end of the row
all right turn your direction because we are going to take a look at some stuff dealing with as i said we re going to review our volume and capacity there we go
all right put your pencils down turn your focus into the board it we ve been talking about this for a while what do we know about it
capacity is something that measures liquids okay when we talk about capacity mainly we are talking about liquids when we talk about the capacity in dealing with liquids what is measured what are we measuring what are we talking about when we talked about the capacity measuring liquids you gallons and quarts okay yes we are talking about gallons
about pints pints what else ounces ounces anything else cups cups remember when we drew the big g and we talked about our capacity we draw our big g what should come next j quarts okay how many quarts are in a gallon
4 so therefore i should draw 4 q s and then how many or what should come next let me say that j how many pints are in a quart 22 so i have 2 p s in each one
c cups and how many cups where there are 2 cups in each pint so from this you told me the other day how many cups are in a gallon n 1616 cups are in one gallon
if there are 16 cups in one gallon how many cups are in 2 gallons 3232 what about half a gallon 8 a
hand all right how many pints are in 6 quarts 24 how many pints are in what did i say
quarts so if you had 6 quarts i m asking you how many pints i have 6 quarts so i have 6 of these q s what i m asking you
024 okay how many pints do you see up here
08 okay so if i add 2 more q s how many p s am i adding inside each 10 so now count all of my pints up together many 12 so how many pints are in 6 quarts how many
12 how did you get 24 cause i was multiplying these 6 times 4 okay because i don t want to know out of the gallon i only want to know if i had 6 of these quarts if i had 6 q s that wouldn t be a gallon it would be like half gallon what did you say it would be like one.5 gallons well if we had 24 pints 0 i m sorry
there if i 24 pints i want to know how many gallon we can figure that out right yeah okay so we re doing pints right gallon 8 there s and just because i need this 8 pints equal one gallon
so if i had 24 pints if i added another 8 pints how many would i have if i added another gallon let me say that you would have 16 pints okay and then if i added if i added another whole gallon how many pints would i have 24 are you sure are you sure yes 24
why are you sure because all you have to do is if you get 3 gallons it would be 816 and then 24 and how do you know that that s my question multiply okay all you did was you added and that s all i want you to do is telling me that
who 0 okay i multiplied 3 times 8 why cause one gallon if 8 pints are in one gallon then like 2 times 8 equals 16 and 3 times 8 equals 24 yes so then you get the same thing okay what did you do
0 because what did you say i just want to understand what you are telling me understand actually 8 times 3 right all right that s fine
here sorry my tangent to make sure we are okay with this capacity yeah please all right what we are going to do is we are going to figure out which one of these cute little tools which one of these objects is going to go where
we have the a columns dealing with volume and the b is dealing with capacity so let s take a look what s the 1st object or item or thing that s right here box a box of what of stuff toys a box of stuff a box of toys
go if you think it should go in volume a give me a one if you think it should go in capacity give me a 2 this is where i need my active votes i should have gotten those so that we could do this okay majority of you are telling me i need to find the volume
why because volume is like the outside of the box like the area or something like the volume or something capacity is for liquids and volume is not okay that s even better when you are talking about your liquids you are talking about capacity here in this aspect
volume you want to know how much can it how much can you get about volume is capacity is for liquids yes all right what about the soccer ball volume one capacity 2 i think we are all agreeing here that it s a volume
wow she moved the screen you want me to go back back button all the way at the bottom there yeah yeah look at this
go all right what about the picture of kool aid it s coffee it s volume coffee one is volume hopefully that wouldn t be in the glass like that capacity okay i think we are all pretty much agreeing that we are talking about capacity
is a triangular prism prism yeah it does resemble a tit but i m really thinking more of triangular prism yes we would measure the volume of that triangular prism all right here is not the baby so don t tell me what about the baby i think what we are talking about here would be the bathtub
so that would tell me the capacity of it we re talking about the water that s going on the inside way the fish bowl 2 you want to talk about the liquid that s on the inside you want to talk about the capacity
cylinder that is a cylinder thank you very much and we are doing the volume that okay here is my question though what measurement that it s a milk carton my question would be is that going to be a cup a pint a quart or a gallon a gallon gallon how many of you say that one s a gallon 0 no no no no
how many of you say that s a quart quart think about the milk you drink at lunch it s a pint how many say a pint i say it s a pint i would say it s a pint too a pint or a cup i d say a pint because if you look on the box on the lunch it says i think it does say a pint obviously we don t drink the milk but that s what i was thinking was that it was the pint
paper paper 0 i thought it was shoes no i would say it was a ream of paper yes we are going to talk about the volume day that is the capacity how much is that do you think well then you could do how many cups of it
i have too many conversations that are going on at the same time now volume a seriously all right let s take a look at water on a very hot day milk shhh and then the last one is a gallon of milk
capacity all right now these are pretty simple and i will say it s pretty simple for our knowledge of what we need to know as far as volume and capacity of course it will get much deeper and the reason why i m saying this is because sometimes when you go places and there is a banquet and you have to go to like a banquet hall or you go to restaurants
0 yeah when you walk in sometimes if you take a look on the wall they might have a sign and it will say a maximum capacity like an elevator yes elevator might say maximum capacity 4 our purpose right now we are just dealing with the capacity dealing with liquids that is talking about like the weight or it could talk about how many people could fit inside that room
okay and the capacity like that sets on the bridges sometimes like how much like the ton when it tells you one ton here i want you to think about this not so let s take a look at number one can you read number one for me j
capacity is a measure of the amount of liquid a container can hold okay if you think that s true you can give me a 12 take a look at you and the board instead of what your neighbor is saying capacity is the amount is the measure of the amount of liquid a container can hold
j if you turn an object upside down or on its side it s capacity and volume okay so if you turn an object upside down on its side it s capacity and volume changes
true so this is the volume this has the capacity right if i turn it upside down will the capacity change this says that yes it will change that changed that changed the capacity changes on moving it that s what that means okay most of you are saying that s false let s see
changing think back to what was that that we did rectangle when we did the parallelogram remember when we had the cards and we had our groups 0 yeah and we cut the rectangle in order to make a parallelogram
here if you are turning an object the volume its capacity is not changing k a baseball has a volume of one is true 2 is false 0 true
w capacity is only a liquid measure be careful
no okay yes because like on the bridges okay hint hint hint that s what i said i had just talked about that and i said 4 our purpose we are just dealing with the liquids but out there capacity does talk about more than just a liquid measure
a liter and millimeter milliliter are only used for measuring capacity i need an answer true or false that s easy overall you all are saying true and they are commonly used
think about the what did i say came in a liter soda and remember how does milliliter and liters compare n milliliter is 1000 or every 1000 is in a liter okay
so obviously a mili milliliter is very very small we are talking about an eyedropper read you must measure lengths of the container too find its capacity think about that one
you must measure lengths of the container to find its capacity right what did you say
c volume can be perceived by measuring the length width and height of a rectangular prism then multiplying those measurements together okay volume determined by measuring length width height of a rectangular prism multiplying those measurements together
i don t see a vote from everybody that s true what s the formula for finding volume length times width times height those are the measurements you are multiplying them together height and it had to be a rectangular prism and not yes all right number 8 let s take a look at number 8 read number 8 for me please a
capacity is a volume inside a container capacity is the volume inside a container hmmm can we like shh
i need a vote 12345678910 vote ah interesting why would that be true
because you re like i don t know volume but if it s a rectangular prism you can measure the rectangular prism inside the volume of the liquid capacity is the volume inside of the container are you figuring the answer is true but my question is why is that true
think about that and don t just tell me i don t know think about why would that be true yes okay you are thinking the liquid has to have some kind of volume
is you re telling me that yes this thing is capacity no it holds capacity that s what i hear from you when you say those words that s what i hear this is capacity
go that s what i need you to tell me is what s going on the inside the liquid that s going on the inside now that i have it all stuck is dealing with the capacity so why is capacity capacity is the volume inside of a container why is that so us measuring volume is not measuring the outside
even though the cute little measurements are on the outside of it volume is not measuring the outside to find the volume you do have to measure the outside but what is volume it s a measurement volume what is volume measuring if i give you a rectangular prism the outside it s not measuring the outside
if you measure the outside of the bottom the side the top that s how you find it yes that s what we just said but if i ask you what is volume measuring capacity what s capacity volume 0 my no you all are just throwing out all the words that we have said instead of thinking and going okay what is she asking me
i am asking you what does volume measure like if i were to go and look up in the dictionary back here and if there s volume it measures that what what okay so a solid figure okay so a rectangular prism that whoo can i find the volume of this book can i find the capacity of this book yes yes no
no why not because it s not a liquid it s not holding anything inside it s not holding anything liquid inside paper okay you are talking about liquid
but i think what this sentence is talking about is when it says capacity is the volume inside of a container its talking about what s on the inside how much liquid can go inside of a container that s the reason why it s saying that
c volume is measured in cubic units such as centimeters that should be cubic centimeters we just couldn t get a little 3 and millimeters cubic meters is that true or false true false is 2 right yes false is 2 true is one
all right and the last one both volume and capacity are measures of the size of 3 dimensional objects both volume and capacity are measures of the size of 3 dimensional objects one is true 2 is false
yeah i don t particularly care for the wording of that one i guess that is true page do me a favor and go down there to there
this we re going to review this because this is where we have the volume that s great and fine and dandy but if you take a look what is the formula for finding the volume okay there s your l for length the w for width and the h for height and any time you see these cute little cube items right here it s going to be measured in what
cubic units cubic units so if you take a look here at this object this is nice and as you all were telling me nice and flat there is none sticking up and there is no missing pieces here so can i use the formula yes what s the length 5 what s the width one what s the height one so what s one times 55 times one
volume 5 cubic units units 5 cubic units simple count 12345 of course i can do that but if you are using a formula it s length times width times height
here why does this object have 27 cubic units j what s the length 3 what s the width 3 and what s the height
3 so what s 3 times 39 times 327 so therefore it is what volume 27 cubic centimeters blah 27 cubic centimeters because they are giving you a measurement here all right take a look at the next one which is an l object now is it going to work if i say 3 times one times 3 no
i would get a volume if i did that of what capacity i would get a volume of what
9 if i multiplied length times width times height 9 if you multiplied what s 3 times 39 times 19 i would get 9 but why is it not 9 cubic centimeters it s not 9 for those of you that are going but why
a okay we don t have nice complete i ll call it complete figure here if you take a look we have an l there s some missing if i filled it in think about when you were back in pre k or kindergarten or whatever
and you used to play with wooden blocks and you build things and you made them into nice neat rows and you put them together if you did that i could simply go length width height you don t do that and you make a bridge of some sort like this or an l and you want to make a tower and you leave some out
volume take off the okay this is where i told you there are 2 different ways we could do it what i can t hear you because what no i just can t hear you because you re whispering i can go do find the volume okay i want to find the volume what am i going to do to find this volume
okay if i did length times width times height i m going to get 29 it s not right that s what i m just standing here and telling you that s not right why is that not right
c because you are not finding the length times width times height on the 2 other ones basically what s wrong with this picture
missing if there are pieces and if you were paying attention you would see there are pieces that are missing c you could like add the extra one and after like separate them and add them together okay 2 ways i could do it and that s what i was trying to get at here
you could separate it meaning hold on i m going to do just this okay imagine seeing just this so imagine seeing just that and this probably would have been better imagine that this piece is not there just imagine that it s not there
this yes what s the length 3 what s the width one what s the height 13 times one times 13 so the volume of this right here this part is what
333 cubic centimeters okay so that didn t help it went straight through okay so then if i were to cut this bottom part off here try to help it with my hand 0 stinker let me do that
careful and you want to do this piece right here in your mind cut off these 2 blocks right here cut them off from the top and put them on side or here yeah how do you find the volume of that
what s your height 12222 what s the width length sorry one and then what s the width 12 times one times 12 so here s 2 cubic centimeters i marked that out 3 cubic centimeters so all of a sudden there is my answer right do add go back to compound remember when you did compound composite figures you found them separated and then you added them together when you add them together what am i going to get
5 cubic centimeters cubic centimeters that is how we got that or if that is confusing you and you are going i just don t get it
it all right let s take a look here at the 1st one where the motorcycle that s simple what s the volume 111 cubic centimeter one cubic centimeter simple all right let s try the next one what s the volume thank you for raising your hand e
8 cubic centimeters 8 cubic centimeters what s this one going to be c 10 cubic centimeters 10 cubic centimeters we re getting there hopefully
e 12 cubic centimeters 12 cubic centimeters this is easy of course it is the next one n 12 cubic centimeters 12 cubic centimeters next one c
have you gotten the answer 35 not 35 go one more
36 cubic centimeters 36 cubic centimeters okay if you all went 4 times 3 is 12 and 12 times 3 i can t do that one go backwards 3 times 3 is 99 times 43636 ah finally here we go one it s not going to be one that s going to make you think lots of imagining but come on
make it easy make it easy a huh 4 cubic centimeters okay if you got 4 cubic centimeters you are telling me that you did what i multiplied 2 times 2 and then multiplied it by one but there s something missing you can t do that
as soon as you have something missing you can t just automatically do that go back to here s a cute little shape what do you need to do it just count it and when you count it what did you get what cubic centimeters 3 cubic centimeters of course you can break it apart but you all if this is so small like that just go through and add
you are going to waste your time breaking it apart just go through and add them up j 5 cubic centimeters 5 cubic centimeters all you have to do is just count this is pretty simple a 5 cubic centimeters 5 cubic centimeters it s a lie detector and i think this is the last one j
27 cubic centimeters 27 cubic centimeters question there s another easy way there s a different way to count shhh what did you say how if it s like 3 times 3 right then one
then you can just equal 6 and you can take away one and use it that yes
think is that if you imagine that this is complete and if you find the volume of it but you know that there s 1234 pieces you could take it away but that s extra work so i m trying to give you extra work
all right textbook open your textbook to page 463 for me please open your textbook for me to page 463
shhh you guys just please do what i said okay no drama just erase it get your textbook out honey just share with him
all right let s take a look you can use your marker if you have a marker with you if you don t have a marker you can borrow someone beside you without getting up to go somewhere else to get one if you don t have one and no one will let you borrow one then just use scrap paper that you are using here all right i want you to take a look at number 2 number 3 and number 4 what s the very 1st thing you should do if you are finding the volume
you the very 1st thing you need to do is write down your formula so go ahead and write down your formula and then i need you to find the volume for number 2 number 3 and number 4 i want to see those answers pull it up for me okay
you 0 wait which one thank you for working so quietly to find your volume
number 2 number 3 and number 4 wait are you doing number 2
0 wait i think that s number 3 so just put 30 just put a 3 beside it instead of going and erasing go ahead and do 23 and 4 like go ahead and have them all out on your desk
0 thank you can we put our books away if we have one up there just put it to the side okay no
which one is which this is number one and then 2
number 3 you need to go back and look at number 4 you added you had to have added in order to get that these 2 where s your eraser i mean your thank you
prism is it a cube so how do you find it how do you find the volume of everything that we ve been doing what do you do it okay but everything is complete here
go back to what we were just doing earlier what you did yesterday what you did the day before that go back to that what s your length that s the problem because i don t know can you count that to find the length do it
down what s the width write it down shhh what s the height height is just how tall is it
how tall is that building write it down i did that no you did the length you did the width i did the height and i didn t mean too okay fine then do the width then it because it s not the right one can i get the height honey then do what i m trying to show you is that they are both the same
0123123 multiply all right let s take a look at number 2 we are going to take it together take a look at number 2
2 length all i need is length length what n what s my length 4 what s my width w 4 my width 3 thank you
a 3 so when i multiply 4 times 3 times 3 and i m so sorry i told you please make sure that you write down your formula what did you get as a volume for number 2 get 36 cubic units 36 cubic units all right let s take a look at number 3 you have a length of 2
a width of 2 a height of 7 a what did you get as your volume 28 cubic yards and then number 4 you have a 0 you have to be careful you have a length of 3 and 5 tenths a width of 3 and 5 tenths and a height of 3 and 5 tenths what did you get as your product when you multiplied all of those together w
875000 cubic meters centimeters centimeters okay any question on that yes yes ma am we have them like that and i tried to do 3 and 5 tenths and and that did not work out yes no cause if you do that what are you going to get
a 103 and 5 tenths times 3 that s all we did and that s the reason a i was telling you not to do this and when you started doing it times 2 no don t do that way you are supposed to square it by itself not times 2 all right take a look very quickly on the next page 464
on page 464 tonight for your homework i want you to take a look at 5 through 17 so homework tonight is going to be 5 through 17 so get out your agendas and let s write down today is the 3rd so let s write down 5 through 17
464 what do you have to say
the benchmark test the next 5 questions actually and i was just in a meeting with the other 4th grade teachers and we were talking about those tests and how these particular questions and how you all did on it
so we should start by opening in our test booklets to page or to number we started with number 13
and i have some really specific data or numbers that tells us about how many did well on this and how many of us did not it but it is somewhere around 50% of the class did well on this particular question number 13
it douglas school needs to collect 14500 soup can labels here it is in the booklet soup can labels to help get new gym equipment in the 1st month they collected 4879 labels
in the 2nd month they collected 6657 labels question what is the question asking 14500 -4879
6657 what does that have to do with the problem there wait a minute wait i mean 14500 -6657
m 1st you have to add 4879 with 6657 together is that what you did but you forgot to tell me you so what are the numbers i am adding multiple students 4879
+6600 what do i need to make sure i do yesterday before i write the 2nd number down here to add what do i need to make sure i do h line up the place value line up the place value so it is 6000
yeah so i have a number here in the 1000s 6657 and so what would be the next thing you would tell me i need to make sure i do when i am adding these numbers
when you are adding those numbers what is the next thing you would tell me to make sure that i did
to make sure we add the one or 10 what do you mean add the one or the 10 mean like if you are adding 9 times 7 9 +7 yeah 9 +7 that would equal 16
and if you put a 6 in and you add the one you put the one right there what do we call that or can i have somebody help me you could ask regrouping is it regrouping yeah yeah it is regrouping
so i need to make sure that i regroup the 10 in the 10s place correct and then if i have 100s left over then i group those in the 100s and the 1000s correct yes and you with me 16 16 and i carry my or regroup my 10 13 so i need to carry 100 now right
yes so this is 8 +one is 15 and now i have 1000 to carry or to regroup and i see a 10 here so i am going to go ahead and add 6 and 4 to get my 10 and then add the one
all i could add the one to the 4 and say 5 +6 is 11 but it would be so much easier if i said 6 +4 10 so i am going to take that 10 and i am going to add my one and i get 11 am i finished with the problem no it is a 2 step problem it is a 2 step problem so i am not finished with my problem
do you need to take 11 m 536 and 14500 and subtract those 2 i am subtracting what from what
11536 from 14500 are we writing all this down are we writing this down
this it says 14500 subtract 11536 and here we have that thing again where we have to subtract from zeros right
are we are what do we call that regroup regrouping or m ungrouping ungrouping or grouping so what do i need to do go ahead finish telling me what i am doing you can not 6 take away 0 can not take away 6 so you go to the next one
0 can not take away 3 so you go to the next one through that one make that a 4
d you have to go to the next one slash it out me go ahead you go to the next one and slash it out so i need to go to the 1000s yeah and i am going to borrow 1000 from there
so i am going to go then put above the 1000 that 3 and put a 4 by the one no i was going to answer the question so 14 subtract 5 make it
9 3 subtract one is 2 so do we have the 1000 choice in our choices
yes so were you all aware that this was a multistep problem yeah but now do you see 0 next time i am going to make sure that i read the question and that i make sure that i know everything i need to do to get it right yes i did the 2 step problem but i got b
wrong i might probably had not this needs to go you are just writing that right there
page maybe i did not regroup and ungroup so maybe you made an error in a regrouping and ungrouping c what do you think that you did that made you get c
14 as we get to 14 15 16 and 17 i do not know what happened the scores got really really bad there it 14 how many more days will it take for a turkey egg to hatch than a chicken egg
how do we solve this problem how do we solve this problem do we have to look at the chicken egg and the turkey egg what so we look at that data and you see that the turkey egg is like right in the middle of 20 and 30
it it would be 28 28 let me ask any of you if you did this i am looking i see that it looks like you numbered these a little bit
on this graph i want put your hands down for a minute because i feel like maybe we did not talk about graphing enough to get you as prepared as you needed to be for this test but you have from 0 to 10 and you have little lines in between the 0 and the 10 we have to number the lines and figure out what it is counting by right what is it counting by
2 is and and you said you numbered your lines so that you would know so you should have known that between 0 and 10 was 2 4 6 and 8 26 22 24 26
so it is important that you know this when you are looking at graphs like this because they are almost always not going to be in increments of one is so the 1st thing any time you look at a graph you need to ask yourself what it is counting by say the 1st question you need to ask yourself any time you look at a graph is
by what it is counting by 2 is so then if we are trying to figure out how many more days it will take for a turkey egg to hatch than a chicken egg what is the operation we are going to be doing addition subtraction multiplication or division
s you would add them do you think it is going to be adding because it says more right yes
k the we are trying to figure out if we are adding subtracting really basically adding or subtracting says that it is addition right more but we are really trying to figure out what it is not adding we are really trying to figure out what
how many more days will a turkey egg hatch than a chicken egg so it is really the difference right we are trying to figure out the difference between the amount of days it takes for a turkey egg to hatch than a chicken egg s subtract subtract so how many days does it take the turkey egg to hatch
26 days are we good with that for 26 days hatch
increments you need to write turkey equals 26 days and chicken equals 21 days numbers so we know how many days is each what should i do with the numbers subtract subtract what 26 i mean 21 from 26
26 so to figure out this problem these are the things that you should have written down to help you solve the problem 6 subtract one is 5 so the correct answer then is 5 now if you are going to to do the work it is possible that you did not get the question right
if you did not know what the graph was counting by it could be very well that you might not have gotten the question right even if you knew you were supposed to subtract teacher yes
i did it a different way but i got the same answer what did you do differently you know how like sometimes when you do a graph and it says one through 10 by actually did not know what it was counted by
by i look at the looked at the lines looked at the line and counted this in between not the line you counted the same as this one but the chicken egg does not go all the way up to any lines wonder how did you know what to count if you did not know what it was counting by
you know how you like when you take like when you do a pictograph you take the line and you draw in between the 2 so you went by halves maybe it worked and it got you the correct answer and you are right but i still want you to focus on when we are doing graphs to ask yourself what what is it counting by
yes what do you want to say i was going to say i did it different too because i did not know what it was counting by but what i did i looked at the lines and i counted one 2 3 4 and i did not know what the answer was but the closest number to it was 5 so i just said 5 no next time you will know exactly what to do and you will know for sure what the right answer is though right
yes do we move on on number 15 cause it gets better boys and girls moving onto number 15 miss s asked some students about their favorite number favorite summer activity the graph below shows the number of students who voted for each activity which activity is enjoyed by twice as many girls than boys
1st of all this is a double bar graph bars one bar represents girls and the other bar represents multiple students boys which bar is representing the girls gray it is gray does the key help you with that yeah and so which one is the boys
one and the key helped you with that so then we know that we need to be looking for what to figure out which one is twice as many
s it will help us figure out if we look at the bar graph and we are counting by 2 is but in between like say the 4 is there you divide between so if there is for example for swimming boys 5 and girls is 10
so that is twice as much so there is twice as many girls who like swimming than boys right yes right yes fishing yes i got fishing it is okay swimming why do you think you might have chose fishing instead of swimming
because there is twice as many boys as girls so maybe you just saw that there was twice as many yes so did you choose swimming or fishing i choose neither 0
so now what advice can you give yourself to make sure that next time you have a question like this that you choose the correct answer why is it like that i just picked fishing because i did not think that 5 was the number cause you did not know exactly but see now that you know what it is counting by you would have known like right in the middle would have been 5
and so there is 5 boys and how many girls for swimming 10 10 so if you saw something like this again what would you tell yourself to make sure that you paid close attention to yourself to know which one is which to know which one is boys which one is girls and to know what it is counting by and what right in the middle is
s i was going to say also about i was going to say if you do not get the question you could read it over twice because it is is not the word enjoyed by twice as many girls right so we need to make sure that we really understand what the question is asking by reading it carefully right
n think a because girls had and on the keys the girls are white and the girls had because boys had more 3 sailing hiking and fishing the boys had more
and swimming just had the girls were more than the boys cause so i picked swimming cause that was the only thing that the girls had so you noticed then that on number 15 that the girls that thought swimming was the only one where there were more girls who wanted to do that than boys
m i do not know how i did this but i still got the right answer i knew that with swimming that the boys was 5 but somehow i put 4 +6 and i got 10
that but i realize now if you take the number of how many girls you have and you minus it of how many boys you have and if you get the same answer that means they are kind of like even well we want to know about how many more
16 i got to tell you right now boys and girls i think in our class 25% got this one right that means that only that means that about 15 of you got it wrong out of 20 that means there are only 5 of you 4 or 5 of you got it right
it a zoo worker recorded the number of customers visiting the zoo each day for 5 days n is it age what kind of graph
it a data graph or it is just blank data but what kind of graph is it h a line graph it is a line graph so write next to it line graph line graph
so the question is which day had the largest increase in customers from the day before so how are we going to know by looking at this graph if the number of customers is increasing how are we going to know that the number of customers is increasing by looking at this graph
because like when the line like with the dots on it go higher it is increasing so with one dot we start
at the next dot is over here and there is a line going in an upward direction that means that the data is increase what did i just say about that if there is a dot and then a line is going in an upward motion to the next dot that means that the data is
used increasing it is important that you understand that word because that is what it is not called rising up in the booklet increasing so we need to look for data that is increasing has the largest increase the one day from the day before so i think that day before mighta caught us up a little bit on it
what day has the largest increase what day has the largest increase the largest increase 5 day 5 has the largest increase an increase is going to be a change
next so number 5 although it is the highest on the other people it is not the largest increase cause it goes from like this day say this is 4 right and it goes here to 5 3 so from 3 to 4 is the largest increase no yes yeah number 3 decreases put your finger on day 3
yes from the next day up it goes it goes up from 3 to 4 which way does the data go day but do you see how it increases from the lowest day increases the data goes up from 3 to 4 right
so then which day has the largest increase from the day before it
4 4 because the day before it has the lowest data that you were saying data so the next day 4 it has the largest increase 4 the day before so that is the largest increase that what was the right answer 4
4 because it says the day before and day 3 it increases but it says the day before so it so the day before 4 is
yes i think i got a row mixed up because i thought because i thought i forgot that increasing i thought it meant down so you thought so maybe next time remind yourself that increase means going up
3 well i thought it was from like the 1st was the one and the 2nd or 3rd day i could take 2 the 1st day it says down here labels so this would be day one and that was 300
450 and then at d so if i said let me ask you another question which day did have the greatest decrease or the largest decrease than the day before be which day had the largest decrease than the day before
3 day 3 has the largest decrease 17 so did you figure out which answer that was
17 the numbers 3 6 and 10 are called triangular numbers why do you think they are called triangular numbers because if you line up they would be on the page and they form a triangle they form a triangle so which of the following is also a triangle number what kind of question is this
this i am waiting for some more to go on over here because i feel like you are just waiting for everybody over here to answer it
let us give them a minute and someone besides you 2 and you you mean me too yeah so then what that is really not necessarily what that means but i want to hear from either or even
is we start with 3 10 what do we think what do you think i know what it is but i forgot what the name of the question is cause you said it the other day well we have to figure out the change let me give you a little hint
the change from one number to the next number m increases this is increasing it is an increasing what we are trying to figure out the change from one number to the next because we are trying to figure out something that is increasing and increasing in a repetitive fashion
repeating what do you think i do not know it is increasing if something is increasing if numbers are increasing we call it something sometimes it is decreasing
sometimes we will have triangles circles smiley face triangle circle smiley face pattern you might not have said 0 this is a pattern but you might have seen that it was something that repeats itself and if you figure out what is going on in the 1st 3 you should be able to figure out what the next one was right
right yeah so how can we figure out this triangular pattern here so the 1st one we have a dot a dot and a dot
3 the 2nd one we have a dot dot dot but then it changes m like the next number what is next well this goes one and then one 2
and so we want to figure out how do we get to 6 cause if you figure out how we get to 6 because it is counting by 30 we add on the 3 is bottom so let us just do that and see how that works
6 so then we start with our original pattern with the 3 3 we add it is one dot at the beginning right next and then this one added 3 more dots right at the bottom 123 and so now how many should we add down here to get our 10
4 so that gives us 10 so if we follow this we are going to have a one dot at the top right then we have 123 here right and then we have 1234 which is this one here what is going to be next
55 no cause 15 is not up here dd a line and that makes 15 and 15 is not one of our choices 21 cause it made a triangle when i did mine what do you think i think it is 20
you think it is 20 i think it is 20
4 it is not 21 because i was trying to make triangles out of the numbers and 14 and 20 i could not make into triangles do not make a triangle student make a triangle so when i gave 21 it made it when i made 21 it made a triangle
and how would you make 21 a triangle it i started at the what did you do girls go ahead and i you did what
i am sorry i did put 6 on the on the bottom 6 because when i was doing 14 that was 5
and there was not a dot at the top and you added 20 that has 6 also but it was not done at the top
top and 25 is too much i tried and 25 is too many yeah and 21 so we started with 6 and then how many 4
25 but the correct answer is 21 21 because remember the other ones that is a good question does 25 make a triangle yes a triangle yes it is probably like a 7 tell me if 25 makes a triangular number cause i am just curious yes teacher you are just telling me
you know this for a fact yeah i got that as an answer up desk if i look over here and see you all doing something else that you are not supposed to be doing i am taking a point
how do you know if you do not try to make a triangle because it will not be even i got 27 28 do you have it on your yeah so you already did it right yeah i did 28 i did it twice and i do not get yeah i got 28
no it is an odd number so then there is only one correct answer there 21 i just want to make sure that 25 was not a correct answer and that they did not make a mistake on that 21 teacher yes
it i think it means like not the next triangle number which one makes a triangle number right which of those choices is going to be the triangular number and 25 is not it cause 25 is not a triangular number is if you are going to argue the point i want you to prove it again for some reason i got you changed your answer
what were you going to say i see the pattern it goes +3 +4 and then +5 and +6 7 it is like starting all over again it is a graph pattern so it is a pattern and we could have figured it out in 2 ways
you could have drawn the actual dot from the triangle right yeah it counted or you could have counted because it increases by the number +one each time this let me tell you what you are going to have on remember i said i am going to pick 10 questions and i am going to reword them
17 number 16 and number 17 12 and then another one that we talked about today was number 8 we are also going to talk about we are also going to over but definitely or was it number 10
10 on your quiz on friday we are going to have a number one like number 161 like number 171 like number 12 and one like number 8
yes you can forget this time so now we got to move onto our lesson just keep those up there like you did before and so let us move onto to our method i want to go back to the question we are not leaving the classroom right now
in the camera no i was just kidding what was the question my question was then it is just recording go ahead play was that your question yeah i thought can we move on because we are going to run out of time let me go back to my question about the students who were going on the fieldtrip to the odu basketball game
remember i wrote that down i am going to write that down but i do not want anybody else to write it down 4 but if i said 4 times 38 would that be the same thing yeah cause it does not matter it is only if it is a division problem very good so i just you to look at the numbers down everybody is pencils down yes
did you write the number sure we do not need to write anything down yet we are going to use this prompt again so i want you to look at so we got 38 students on 4 buses i want you all to look at this for a moment and i want you to tell me what you think the answer is going to be between
think about what you know about estimation and multiplication cause we practiced it so just what do you think what do you think the answer is going to be between what and what and then maybe by the end of today we will be able to solve it like for real and see if we are close answer and i am going to put all the choices up here you have one already
between i think it is going to be between 5 and 8 i mean 10 38 no there is 38 students going on each bus going how many students do you think are going to be going on the fieldtrip all together
down i do not want to hear from you because you did not follow directions m i think it is either 150 to 180 why because i estimated i rounded from 38 and equals 40
0 but like i do not know if it is exactly 16 cause i have estimated right good so she says it is going to be between 150 and 180 is what you are saying because when you estimated you got about 160 so does anybody want to add to that agree to that or say something different
teacher i have a question go ahead i agree with her because because like she said how she how she estimated so you think it is going to be between 150 and 180 yes do you write down the answer you should not write anything down you do not have to write anything down so you write anything down then i am not going to hear from you
what do you think i think it is going to be between 120 and 180 because if you times 3 times 4 is 12 and then i just added the 0
and then i added the 0 for 18 because with that i multiplied to get to 18 120 i am listening and then i just added the 0 to it so you think it could be closer less than 150 so can i change your estimation into less than 150
150 eah what do you think i agree with because it is the same thing she said but what i did was i estimated 38 and then round 2 and then i just added a 0 to the 4 and round to 40
so i agree with a lot so do you think it is going to be between 150 and 180 i want to know if anybody wants to narrow the range in other words this range is about between it is 30 people is in this range between 150 and 180 that is a difference of 30 people
people does anybody have want to narrow the range between blank and blank but you have to have a good reason to not just because you want to because you have to be able to prove to me why do you think there could be a smaller range
and i multiplied 4 times 4 and i got 16 and i added the 0 38 so i think it will be between 160 and 170 m i am thinking probably between 150 and 160
why because i rounded 38 to the nearest 10 and got 40 and then i multiplied that to 4 times 4 0 and then i think it is 8 and i rounded it higher and i round it lower i think it would be less than 160
so you think it is between 150 and 160 and you think it is going to be less than 160 d i because what i did was i took the 8 off of the 30 and i did 30 in my head and got 120
i do not know if it is exactly 120 cause i did not add the 8 is so i think it will be between 120 and 150
150 yeah so kind of like said but for different reasons t i 118 and 140
where do you get the 118 from i got the 118 from i need mathematical calculations i got the 118 from i mean cause 4 times 3 is 12 and then i just added the 8
s 0 you what no i think it is going to yeah maybe 180
no i said 140 and 180
140 so you think it is going to be between 120 and 140 but why because when i multiplied it i came up with did you multiply it or did you estimate i estimated and when i got my answer i said i got and i wanted to get 120
so i just added my 0 to the 4 there i know it is not see what happens is you start hearing everybody else is estimations and you start thinking you start looking at the numbers and you start taking them apart
mind like some of you took the 30 and multiplied it times 4 and you are like i got to do something with that 8 you were not quite sure what to do with that 8 but you were thinking in your mind some of you we got to do something with that 8 right some of you just went ahead and rounded it to 40 and did multiplication in your head so you know you are on the track of we can not forget about the 8 if we are trying to figure out exactly how many kids are going right and so that is how we come up with all of these choices of estimation
so we are going to come back to that teacher can i go to the restroom sure i do not want to erase that i am just going to move this for now so that we can use this so now i am going to show you how to multiply how to solve a problem like this but not this problem
later if i have say 27 times 3 the 1st thing i want to do is i wanted to be able to have zeros that i can work with so what do you think i can maybe do with this 27 to make it have some zeros that we can work with some of you kind of idea with it when we said i looked at the 30 and then we had the 8
do i think we could either round it to 30 or 20 and like do that and then add them and then after we do that multiply the 7 we could but we do not want to do any rounding with it because we do not want to do we are not estimating we want an exact answer question i am not expecting you to know the answer i just want to hear your thoughts what do you think
what do you think think you could count them i guess this you could do 7 times 3 and then we could do 7 times 3 and then 0 so if i did 7 times 3 and add a 0 we have 210
are we trying to get the exact we need exact up i think we should multiply the 2 and the 3 and that would make 6 70 if we multiplied 2 and the 3 would it just be a 2 or what is the place value of this what is the value of the 2 here the 10s what is the value of the 2 here
2 in the 100s 2 is not in the 100s here
what is the place value of the 2 here what is the place value of the 2
20 so if we multiply and who was saying multiply the 2 and the 3 7 hold on 23 equals 60 and then i just add the 7
7 yeah and that equals 67 es does that look right no m i was thinking like we would multiply the 20 times 3 and that is 60 and multiply the 7 times 3 and that is 21
and add 60 +21 and i got 81 me let us try it using a box so we think it might be 81 if we did it this way right please right now right this 2nd write down the example
we have 27 times 3 so we took the 2 in the 10s place and made that 20 60 we took the 7 in the ones place and we multiplied that times 3 and we got 21
81 so you should be writing all this down right down so i can erase it so i can write down the next example like on the last one it is 7 times 3 there is an equals sign 0 equals 21
you got that and then we added those 2 products together that is why i was confused because right beside that equal sign is a plus maybe if it would help if i put it a little bit lower or a little bit higher or a little bit higher i think you are right here now we can see it
problem so i have 27 times 3 but now we are going to do it using the rectangle sections area model box method ways i want to write 27 in expanded form and i am going to write down that in the top of my box how would i write 27 in expanded form
you put expanded form you put a 2 and a 0 which is then a plus sign and then plus i said put a plus sign plus what and then +7
add my friend i thought she was doing the regular one like we were doing like a week ago like say 20 times 30 that one but she is doing it like this and she put like a line in the middle and a line there we are going to do that that i am going to put a line right where i put my plus sign and you are going to do it too
sections so now we have a 10s box and a ones box but we do not have to i will just tell you why in a minute or maybe you will discover why today we are not going to have to do that because what should i put here 3 so all i have is ones here
so if i only have ones here do i need to make more sections no so let us break it down did same thing that we just did i am going to multiply my ones times these 10s what do i get 20 i am asking so let us just give her a chance
60 and now i am going to multiply my ones and my ones s want to go sorry in my words here i am multiplying 3 times 7
21 good is that the same 2 numbers that we had the 1st time next add it
box i am not going to try to do it cause i do not want to mix any numbers up when we are solving multiplication problems you need to be using you have not written anything down sweetie we do not want to try so squish it up into small little space space it could be a little bit neater on the lines which is fine
i am not criticizing you that it is not very neat but what i am hope i am making is that you are using space because if you use space you do not squish the numbers up together and end up making mistakes that you do not need to make thing yes did you add it
yes can we do one more example and then i am going to try you all on your own
no yes i just want to get this over not really because you probably did the old the traditional way and we are not doing traditional today can we take a vote can we take a vote no no vote we are going to do another one together
and we are going to go we are going to do the rectangle sections that are the box method do i am looking for some new people to answer the question yourselves
you should like put 60 +71s 0 60 +27
example 0 60 +2 else let us see who am i looking to say something
i have a question okay is not it supposed to be multiply or is it supposed to be plus yeah like 60 times 2 because on that example it says 20 no no we did the 27 was the expanded form 20 +7 was the expanded form of 27
so 60 +2 is the expanded form of 62 so we just took this and we broke it down to make it easier to work with so what is the next thing i am just going to go ahead and do this because we want you to know to draw your box so once i have my box what should i do
you put the 7 on the side i will put my 7 on the side it yeah why is it important to put that line there because it separates your 10s from your good
values what is the next thing i should do next thing you should do is say what is 7 times 6 or 7 times 60
can we just do 7 times 60 7 times 60 is what i was going to say i was taught a different way
grade this line was the 1st to divide so 7 times 60 is 420 3 and so what should i put in this box here
so this was brought it is sort of not the way how i was taught but it still made sense that is what i am asking you it would i tell you to put a 14 in this box
yes why would i put a 14 in this box m because 7 times 2 is 14 different so now what do we need to do
you are just sitting there and it just is making me frustrated because i am going to ask you to do one on your own and you are going to have a hard time add 420 +14 so down here underneath the box i am going to write 420 +14
434 like that yes s the one should be underneath the ones column and your 10 should be in the 10s column so in other words you are in the 100s like this
you so then if i do it correctly what am i going to end up with 434 that is my answer if you have this and you will you are going to do one right now do not leave your answer down here here always write your original problem then break it down down here
434 i do not ever ever ever ever everybody listen to me want to have to go searching for the product now teacher shhh one to do on your own right now yes can i get some water we got to do this 1st
keep it covered up good i saw yours
you saw it
you are supposed to be doing this one
here but you do not have it set up right good job it that is it is the same thing except the numbers from here are down here do not do that that this goes on top of the box not in the box cause we are figuring out what is going in the box
when we solve the product the product it is about the area that is in the box top and i am sure if i talk to miss m that would not be what she told you you need to wait for to come back can i get a drink of water you know what no
no our lesson is not finished good no remember we have to break it down so we broke down 27 to 20 +7
30 why would we break 26 down to 30 no 27 we wrote in expanded form to 20 +7 7 so 26 we are going to break down to
yes which one we doing it no one is leaving the classroom no
there 5 times 20 is what you need to slow it down what is 5 times 6
my you did not put the 5 over here for multiplying
0 so you have to multiply this and this 10 where are you getting the 31 from this list why are you doing that 5 times 20
9 write it in the box and then 6 times 5 do teacher is that 20 +6
60 it is still 5 times 20 +6
26 write it in expanded form you did not do anything that we did on the board did you do anything that i told you to do when we were doing it on the board no cause i did not know the way to do it
it so i do not understand why you would not do what i was telling you to do so you would know how to do it part yes up here hold on 20 +6 20 above this box
box 0 now i get it 100 5 times 6 yeah and then we add that together right you 5 times 6 is
did you get it 5 times 2 is 10 and 5 times 20 is you see what you did
good let us break this down on the board real quick this is what you should have on your paper 20 +6 because we are writing in expanded form the 10s and the ones right yep
here so if we multiplied 5 times 20 we get what 100 and multiply 5 times 6 we get what here and what do we get
434 hold on a minute i want you to look at this carefully i want you to tell me what your mistake is
so do not say anything it is an easy fix it is an easy fix it should be 130 boys and girls now to end this i want you to solve our problem how many students which one of these is closest estimate to how many students are going to be going to the odu basketball game so do we estimate that one or do we times it
no we are actually i want you to solve it for the exact answer and see which estimation is closest it is which one it is the one that says let us give everybody a chance solve the problem did you solve it
i already did you did yeah i did that earlier too and i did not raise my hand i want you to solve it the easier way when you do not have to sit there and add and add and add
easier might be a little bit faster did you figure it out go ahead explain in words why you got a different answer it was your the place value right
that so what is the correct answer why 400
box can you do that really quickly no you got to slide this 11 yes
where is it
so it did not work the 1st time right no he probably showed it the right way but maybe you just do not remember cause it has been a while i do i do remember cause so which estimate is closest to the amount of kids that are going to the odu basketball game
which is the closest between what and what what what do you think what is the 150 to 160 160 150 to 160 because how many kids are going
yes good so when we started this yesterday do you think that you would already be multiplying it and having it done like that by the end of today no good so this is going to be your homework tonight boys and girls you are going to have some problems where you have to solve them like this
will you collect the pink booklets please and everybody else i need for you to take out your science binders
all right boys and girls a couple of weeks ago we talked about estimation
estimation this morning i had you look at these and as you were walking out i had you look inside of these what i want you to do is in your buckets there are sticky notes grab one sticky note and i want you to put your name on one of those sticky notes
and then you are going to split with your pencil draw a line down the middle and on one side you are going to put g for gobstopper and on the other side you are going to put r for runts okay gobstoppers and then runts if at any time you are having any issues with a group or a member just raise your hand and i can walk over there and i will know and then you guys can ask me a question on how i can help you be better
sense yes okay but for this purpose right now i think we re going to be fine all you have to do is write down on the g side the g side for the gobstopper how many gobstoppers do you think are in this container
think remember looks can be deceiving sometimes cause i was kind of shocked myself
now on the r side on the r side i want you to write down how many runts there are what you think and someone this morning asked me question question i noticed that a few of them are broken do we count each broken piece as one or
broken so what i did when i counted is i put the banana pieces back together i counted it as a whole not a fraction but a whole whole what s it called runts r for runts
too so right after you write it on a sticky note i want you to take your sticky note and i want you just to slap it right on top of your paper somewhere where you can still see all of the words and the questions on your work page okay what do you think is a reasonable what do you think is a reasonable estimate for runts for runts what do you think
108 a 108 okay 4141 do you really think there s going to be 41
s 90908080808125 a 125 does anyone have anything bigger than s and s was 108
37200 anyone have anything bigger than 200 21210 anyone have anything higher than 210 k 27270 anyone have anything higher than 270
what there are 200 can i get a drum roll 94 runts in here k now if there are 294 runts in there don t erase your i see erasing going on
g does anyone have more than 200 written down 217 huh 217217 anyone have anything close to that
dear 102 a 199992 what 14214 what did you get 217217218218 wo 222100 a 10010
110 and one more because we have to move on k 22220 and guess how many are in there a little drum roll 214 yes how did you guess that m already told me how many were in there see that s what happen when you teach more than one class 190 i had a who was closest to 214 without going over
tomorrow everyone s going to get some candy 214 see and that was my trouble about candy cause we can share this later us but the purpose of today s lesson the purpose of today s lesson is to make reasonable estimations but using your eyes and using what you know about mass
poster i kind of cut up our can you pick up your things please and go next door to missus b s room thank you room thank you for standing up and taking your things and going to missus b s room cooperative this way please
you now like i was saying we re going to focus on mass but we re going to also focus on estimation what do we know about mass yes mass is the weight of an object mass is the weight of an object
sorry what are the most common metric units of measurement that we learned yesterday yeah metric are a liter okay and we re talking only about weight just about weight and if you get confused the posters are up there that you can see there s kilograms kilograms
so write there on that line i want you to underline metric units and i want you to write on that line kilograms like said and what else is there for metric there s grams you have grams kilograms and grams what does one gram equal to a nonstandard unit nonstandard what does one gram if i am thinking of a gram i want to think of this object
r one gram equals something an object what kind of object do we think of when we think of one gram cracker is that why it s called a graham cracker neat how about that s metric does everyone have kilograms down on that line and grams
yes now if you look further down you will see that there s a metric column column on that metric column what should we put right next to metric so that it reminds us let s put those abbreviations of g and kg
they g and kg g and kg which stand for what g and kg stand for goose eggs grams turn and talk to your partner and tell him and i am going to come right back to you
kilograms and grams and we re talking about metric units grams grams grams you said grams did i say that you said grams you said how about grams 0 my goodness
right what are the most common customary units of measurement them and we re just talking about mass right
weight just about weight all right give me 5 and give me 4 what did your partner tell you that pounds and ounces pounds and ounces pounds and ounces
ounces what are the abbreviations of pounds lbs a 1616 so 16 ounces equals a pound pound maybe possible right
now the next question next essential question is like what kind of tools do we use to measure just mass weight because mass and weight are synonyms for each other cause i keep hearing some volume stuff going on but we re going to visit volume tomorrow
today we re thinking of things that we can weigh because i weighed myself this morning and i said good golly actually no i was pretty proud of myself yes you can weigh a cat you can weigh a cat yourself you can weigh yourself snails you can weigh a snail hear what a fish a fish a worm a what
a watermelon a watermelon let s think of something that is not food something that is nonliving j huh a trunk a truck
truck would you would we use pounds or would we use like tons d a bucket now with that said this is what we re going to do today the purpose of this lesson i think i have already told you was to make a reasonable estimation
i have found that sometimes and i remember being a 5th grade student perfect i am not expecting you to make the correct estimate but i want you to make a reasonable estimate so that s why you are going to be you have pens in your buckets and you are going to use your pen to make an estimate
here look at 45678910 those are 7 items that you get to choose from you can actually see through the marks that i have made and i am actually going to put this on my elmo real fast so that you can see exactly what i am talking about
here it s going to look really tiny cause i have to scoot this desk back yeah it s thinking on anyways those things are blacking out
the 1st one you can actually see through it and it actually says math book i believe book and it s your choice whether or not you want you can t really see that but in front of you is math book as a group you are going to decide if 7 objects 7 objects that you want to weigh 7
7 okay you can weigh can you weigh can you use a desk to put the desk right in that bucket no no so we have to have some common sense right yeah items that are around the classroom all right and there are some items already on your desk that you can use like a mug you can use an eraser okay you can use missus l s little heart tin can
okay can we use this use a timer those are what we are going to do to balance out that scale and it s up to you to work with your groups anything i asked you not to touch anything
one thing that i forgot to do was hand you guys graphic organizers right
go so who wants to tell me let s just revisit the directions because i want you to do it right the 1st time so you are not crossing things out where there s black marks right here you are going to make 7 choices if i want to weigh a math book i am going to put a math book in there
but there are times around the classroom that you can weigh you can weigh something that s in your desk like a ruler like this stapler like your shoe shoe one of them is an apple pointer room and you could also weigh your pencil there s lots of things that you could weigh in the classroom your pencil box a ring
bucket we re not going to look inside of our boxes just yet but what happens what happens if i put my mug here and then i put let s put something that s heavier than this pound that s what happens here we go that s what happens right can you okay let s let go of it and see what happens
tumble put it all the way back there we go heavier if i were to this in there with it 1000 grams 1000 grams equals what one kilogram right if i were to put that in there it would probably weigh more than that mug
conversions that s why you are going to use the posters in just a minute to help you with your conversions i am going to designate one person actually you guys can decide who is going to be the estimate captain to make sure that everyone has their estimates down in pen 1st before beginning their experiment their experiment
do all right you can get started
you all right go ahead and start your estimations grab a pen guys grab your pens and start your estimations
are we doing our estimates how
when you have finished raise your hand and i will let you know what the next thing that you are going to do after that
rock how many poker chips are in there a 100 how many poker chips are in there
in the if there s 50 in there then you need to take this out right
if there s 50 in there you are going to write down 50 and then you are going to use these weights right here to put on the other side put these back into the box please put the whole box in there
all right give me 5 give me 4 and you know 4 and 5 and 3 and 2 and one mean freeze
now now that you have kind of decided what items you want to choose from you are not going to weigh anything just yet so if you have things that are inside of your balance beams or you are balancing scales then you are not doing the right thing
the next thing that you are going to do is take your pen and you are going to write down your estimates for those objects and you are going to make before you write down an estimate i want you to discuss why that why did you choose that estimate and why is it reasonable estimate it s up to your team
group do we have to do the customary thing yes
r no that s okay because when i review this you are going to hear everything
fine and you haven t started your estimations track huh
i do not know
think how much is one kilogram a kilogram is about maybe a 1000 a 1000 what grams a 1000 grams okay so what s half a kilogram 500 do we change it
the estimate yeah you can change it
pen with a pen while we re estimating all right give me 5 give me 4 give me 32 now now that you had some time to do some discussions about estimating for metric let s talk about customary units
customary units are ounces and pounds i want you to go ahead and estimate in ounces and pounds don t forget that you are using ounces and pounds for customary okay go ahead and go over to the customary block
estimating if you are not finished with metric you can finish up metric 1st and then move on to customary
all right give me 5
i have noticed that most of you not all of you but most of you are finished making your estimates so now you can go and actually do the actual the actual is going to with your pencil okay the estimates are in pen actual is written in pencil fine you can actually use you just fix it
it now it s up to you to explore and you are going to kind of run into some problems s his hoe keeps falling or like the container keeps falling over right so that s why you are in a group right
i am going to wait just for a 2nd to make sure that everyone is listening because i want us to remind i want to remind you about our math guidelines our discussion guidelines for classroom discussion ideas and that i have been hearing and i have been writing down some great things that i have been hearing
j here it is it says explain how you explain how you reason read number 3 to me which is to me the most important r listen with your hands down with your hands down when someone else is talking or you just listen
when someone else is talking you just listen you don t have anything in your hands listening we ve been practicing this pretty much every day so that s what i am counting on seeing does anyone have any further questions for me because i am looking at the time and i want to make sure you have some good time to explore and then some time to discuss with missus l at the end
bathroom okay you need to go to the restroom take care of it and i will be there in just a minute hands all right the rest of you go and get to exploring i am coming around to see what you are doing
water throw that away and i want you to please wash your hands understand someone s been using some hand sanitizer over here
because they touched my shoes it s okay that s all good what s wrong with touching my shoes nothing s wrong with it
they are just trying to make sure that they sanitize go ahead and start at 4 and 5 you could do 456 and 7 looks like and 8 go ahead and just start have you guys finished making estimates already yeah pretty much
so it looks like you could start 456 and 7 go ahead and start 456 and 7 missus l i got a question that s not 2 or 3 ounces what s not 2 or 3 ounces 03 is not 2 but you but it s still wobbly it s too wobbly okay hold on a 2nd now what can you use besides ounces
use pounds can you really use pounds kilograms listen listen to my question right you have 2 ounces right there yes how many grams equals an ounce poster remember what missus
year one ounce equals it s up there on the poster group say that one more time because i missed it
time 2 ounces no what was what are you guys on again i said 16 grams equals one ounce 1616 grams 16 ounces equals one we should say one ounce because you said the heart box was kilograms and if you look up there how much is one ounce
grams 28 grams missus p said last year 28 gs equals 10 z out continue you guys are falling behind
continue all right you have your estimates down right well you can already start
you can start 45 and 6 and i want you to start with your group please go back with a pen and get started with your estimates you and i don t understand why those are in your shoe
careful got to be careful why don t you put the timer in there that rock was like 185
this do you think ounces are what system but i think less is pounds and pounds are what ounces we re talking about metric kilograms kilograms so you need to i forgot about kilograms it s okay you can go over there and borrow a kilogram over there
they are going to borrow your kilograms
purposes all right now because of time purposes i want you guys to go ahead and get your actual for 4 for 567 and 8 it looks like you guys are down to 8
started have you guys been close not 5 grams and it s not even 11 grams multiple students say that again there was only one that we got exactly right on our estimates really what was that the ring why do you think that
the 2 grams why do you think you got that like right why do you think that gram very light very very light and so is my ring as light as what paperclip paperclip rs l we can t figure this out
it s not 2 ounces it s one ounce so can you just say about you think about one ounce but before but before we do that don t forget this weighs more my question is you are using ounces for metric right no for customary sorry customary so for metric what kind of mirrors
grams feel one ounce nothing right but can you convert can you use grams to figure out how many ounces yes so i am going to take 5 grams out and i am going to put in one
in one ounce it s already heavier so this is this one ounce is too big right grams 67 and 1011 you guys count
112126360 wait that was too much go so that hold on wait say 510 actually i want you guys to figure this one out on your own
do think about that question after you get how many grams think about what you need to do to figure out how many ounces for customary all right give me 5 give me 4 give me 3 give me 2
one and i can t believe i am down to 0 because when i said 5 we should ve been frozen when i said 5 you should ve been frozen and you need to be at your seat now when i am looking at the time and unfortunately time is against us
us i am going to give you 3 more minutes of exploration and then we re going to come together and we re going to have a little bit more discussion and unfortunately we have to pack up and go to minutes try to get this done well then you can stand up and find somebody else s right over here
ounces can i have some ounces please we re going to need them here in a minute though cause we need them now
ounce here s some ounces please can i borrow these you have grams over there here the shoe
me i am going to weigh myself but as a group did you guys put down s weight no because i didn t measure myself right are you guys working together yes
if you are going to weigh the pencils that are in that pack why are they and grams in the same bucket of that pack good point where should those grams be that right so you need to figure out you need to take out some things
i asked you about that inside isn t that exciting that it s more
my shoe was on the feet my shoe wasn t up there one kilogram weighs more than that shoe right yes so that s too much
missus l is going to let you do it because i keep finding myself wanting to help you
now if your shoe is off i would like for you to put it back on your feet or on your foot area if you have anything in the buckets i want you just to make right in the middle put all your things that you were weighing in the middle that are missus l s things but if they are your things you can put away go ahead and put all the weights back in your buckets i am going to watch as you clean up your areas
that was a fun activity he got weighed i got weighed that s why one of our rules is what control not self control common sense you can t can t stand right in the middle of your desk right
all right let s go ahead and come back together as a whole group
share if there s something that is if there s an issue that you want to bring and let missus l know like what kind of problems did you have doing this assignment i am not talking about a problem that you had with your neighbor i am not talking about that but i am talking about with measurement with mass with weights
happening and i wrote down some of i am going to wait until i don t hear any of the click click click stuff because all those stuff needs to go in your bucket here this is probably the only group that didn t pay attention and listen to my directions and i asked you to put them right in there
quickly what did you notice probably something that you struggled with why because we tried we put the rock in there and then we tried to put we listen with our hands down remember that
we tried to put we tried to put ounces yes and what s wrong with ounces and measuring the rock i tried 5 ounces but it didn t work why do you think that think about ounces think about that ounces when i think of an ounce i think of a slice of cheese
cheese when i think about ounces i think of about a slice of cheese and when i think of a rock i think of heavier than a slice of cheese used you could use you could ve of maybe not even used your balance but you could ve used a in in pounds right okay
k well we took s shoe and we measured it over here on the balance and we grabbed the kilogram we grabbed the pound but it kept falling down okay if it kept on being heavier than the shoe what is that telling you you need to do grams grams we tried grams too
yes when you have the stuff in your hand and you have to grab and stop the thing once you put it in there and stuff you think you the stapler was 153 grams but we guessed 60
too way off and remember if you have something to share with us ladies if you have something to share with us please it to our conversation don t just have your side conversations please because i want to hear what you have to say if it has to do with what we re talking about okay
c we had a problem with just being able to use grams and kilograms cause sometimes when we were doing the metric thing we used the other we need to use customary because it wasn t working with the grams so if this is my question to you if the metric wasn t working could you have used u s customary yes and then you would have to do what with that u s
customary and that s what this problem you guys had this similar problem over here with your shoe with s heavy shoe had so what should he have done to fix that problem if they had if they had used grams instead of i mean not grams if they used let s say they had to go over to use pounds that
maybe kilograms kilo let s look at our chart over here it was you who had said go ahead and revisit what you just said guys sorry you are the one who said something about mixing up metric with customary up i said it was hard just being able to use metric when we had a problem okay i am sorry and it s my bad
i do not know who said that you had to sometimes go over to u s customary to change over because it didn t work mind probably just in my mind well i thought i heard this is what i thought i heard and i thought we were going to doing the right track
i thought we heard and this is i mean i thought that i heard that okay grams and kilograms wasn t working for me so i had to go over to pounds and ounces if i had to do that if i had to go over to ounces and pounds how can i convert my ounces and pounds back to the metric that i was supposed to be using
that turn and talk and let s try to figure out that turn and talk to someone in your raise your hand if you need me to revisit that question because it s confusing to you time okay let s say missus l wanted to weigh herself and she used i used pounds
i am using pounds and i get my measurement but it says that i have to use metric i have to put missus l s weight in using metric grams and kilograms how can i convert my pounds into let s say grams or kilograms
hint there s something on the board right there our conversion chart because this right here one kilogram is about i should ve used squiggly lines £2 and one is about half a kilogram and those squiggly lines just means about
about so go ahead and turn and talk and tell let s say missus l weighs £180 how do i convert that into kilograms how do i convert that into kilograms you said £180 missus l weighs £180 how do i convert that over to kilograms you divide it
well if a kilogram is £2 you are talking to your group not to my eyes
that how do you convert pounds into kilograms i say we need to make a giant scale so you are you going to fit in here nope there s a scale right over there that i could step on l she said that stick your foot in here and balance possibly all right give me 5 give me 4
one how would i convert £180 into kilograms if i know and this is what i know this is what gave you one equals half a kilogram
you would have to make 2 times 40 and then you have 2 times 40 and what s 2 times 40
2 times 40 is 80 and if you were 180 the 80 part would ve been like would ve been like 40 400 40 kilograms yes if i was £80 i would be 40 kilograms i would been half half of my pounds but i am 180 so what would i be it would be 40 +50 so you would be 90 kilograms yes and would you rather record would you rather record 90 kilograms or would you rather record £100 on a document
90 kilograms 90 kilograms doesn t that look better i wish i on all my doc even on my id i could write 90 kilograms why why do you think i would rather weigh 90 kilograms because they wouldn t see that and they d say you were £90 i d rather be £90 so my last question to you my last question to you is how has your thinking changed about estimation
estimate turn and talk to your partner and this is the last question i have for you today 117 so how is your thinking changed about estimation
it kind of try a little bit right how about you did you try okay well tomorrow i want you to try with a whole bottle of sprinkles
i want you to be that whole bottle of sprinkles and i want you to try extra hard tomorrow question how has your changing how has your thinking process changed about estimation now it how is your changing how has your thinking about estimation changed sometimes don t use your hands never use your hands sometimes don t use your hands because your brain plays tricks on you sometimes
all right give me 5 give me 432 but i do not know about you but i am tired of saying 5 and you not listening i would like to ask you that question again because what i see going on is not what i expected what i see is a lot of playing going on a lot discussion not about our question
steps i am going to ask you the same question but this time i would like to see your hand raised ready how has your thinking changed about estimation what strategy did you use before and how would you change it now
j well when we were estimating we were using our hands and we found out that we were way off so we said next time don t use your hands right what would you use instead of like with both objects in one hand and then the other object in the other hand instead what do you already know
we already know that some things are not what they seem to be okay but what do you already know about mass
that it s a weight yeah i know that i know that in every i know that everyone in here understands that mass is weight but my question is what strategy could you use about what you already know about certain measurements example i know i know that i heard i heard over here that said something
do you want to share with the class about your ring and your estimation we our estimate was that m ring weighed 2 grams because it was very light and a gram was very light and when we weighed my ring it was actually the exact same as our estimate it was actually 2 grams but like why did you guys choose 2 grams
that because we knew it wasn t a gram well the size of the ring know how did your mind what did you know previously before if you look up to my poster we know that one gram is about what paperclip and if you look at her ring it kind of mirrors a paperclip doesn t
sort of looks like a well i mean it kind of like weighs as light as a paperclip right estimating when you are estimating in ounces and when you are estimating in pounds you need to think of that when i say a ton you are going to think of a elephant or a monster truck
yes i think her ring weighed 2 ounces because she has the jewel on it and probably without the jewel it would just weigh an ounce e what has what your how has your thinking changed
my thinking has changed because i was overestimating grams i was thinking of grams as ounces so when we weighed my shoe i we all estimated 31 grams it was actually 165 grams right and i was listening to you and talk and you were like well i am just going to put this down remember that
fine you are your own person and you can do that but at least now you know right
yes well my thinking has changed that because you put it in something else on the balance scale it actually turns out heavy that your hands are so like your hands you can use to lift things or something things and it seems really light and when he was doing you and 180 instead of doing what they did we actually divided divided by what
2 divided by a 180 exactly or 2 divided by 180 yes we divided 2 into 180 and we see how many we got you divided 2 into 180 but how would you say that instead of 2 divided by 180 a 180 divided by 2 yeah it s 180 divided by 2
front today s date march 3rd 2011 and the video number is 306 okay we re live
guys so to start here we talked a little bit about what we were going to do today but we haven t got into it too much and i want to leave a little bit of it open to you guys calculators i think this class mostly worked with the smaller blue calculators calculator i m going to leave it open to you guys whichever one you want to work with today okay
way 0 i ll pass out the larger calculators manually the other ones you don t have that option
these i think if you run into trouble with it you can just get up and get one of the smaller blue ones okay
it it s right there are you good with this okay yes
okay and again if you don t if it doesn t seem to be working properly for you you can get up put the bigger calculator away and just take the blue one the small blue ones
one everybody have a calculator now yes okay
if you have one of these so far we ve been working with which place values to the right of the decimal can somebody name them for me one thousandths thousandths so since we ve been only working with place values up to the thousandths we re going to go ahead and set these to thousandths okay
yesterday you see a little button in the top left hand corner it says fix button you hit fix and hit 3 and you should see 0
good now what will happen now guys is that if we divide a number by another number it will only carry it out the answer out 3 place values to the right of the 0 okay there may be more but we won t see it off and the reason we re doing this is cause that s what you re responsible for
we can talk about what will happen in a little while if we took that off and it just carried out but for now let s leave them set like this for our recording purposes okay and as far as the people with the small blue ones yours are set to continue out okay more than 3 place values to the right of the decimal when we record them on this table that we re going to do today i only want you to record up to the thousandths okay later all right let s review a little bit about what we talked about when we 1st passed these calculators out yesterday
i asked everybody to look at this fraction here and find out a way that it could be represented on your calculator with decimals can you guys i know you weren t here yesterday so you need to pay attention to this part okay
it what do you think you need to do to show me what this looks like as a decimal it s going to be 0 point something right 0.5 it s going to be 0.5 right but how do we make our calculators get us there 0.5 well that s what some kids did yesterday yep they put 0.5 equals right and then it just showed up as 0.5
trying but we actually want to use this numerator and this denominator but it s a question of how we used it yesterday it divide what so you re saying take one divided by 2
hasn t one divided by 2 equals and what do you get 0.500 okay so you set your calculator to go 3 places out to the right of the decimal so it should say 0.500 now if you were to hit f 2 or fix 2 it would say 0.50 and if you would hit fix one it would have said just 0 0.5
correct all right so we re controlling the place value with that fix button fraction how can i show this fraction as a decimal p one divided by 4 try it out happens how do you like get it back to you put ac
out and then do it all over again yep it i got it what did you get and for you people that did it on the what did you get
0.25 now we know that too because we know a 4th is a 4th of a dollar and we know that ¢25 is also a 4th of a dollar right
okay so now we re going to go ahead and talk about how we can well let s look at our objective 1st
today students use their knowledge of fractions okay so it s not just a calculator today guys know i know that if i didn t have a calculator and i asked you guys to show me this as a decimal that you could go ahead and you could write in 0.5 right that if i asked you what this was and you didn t have a calculator could you tell me that it was 0.25
okay if i asked you what this is 3 eighths could you with what you know about fractions could you show me a decimal equivalent without using your calculator probably not could you think through it and do it okay i m interested in just seeing about that part of the objective
students use their knowledge of fractions the other part is what you have in your hand the calculator as well as calculators to complete a fraction to decimal division table that s a fraction to decimal division table
fine okay take a look actually everybody take out this page it s page 30 it s page 35 in your student activity books
i do have extras up here if you re making there s going to be a lot written on this table today so if you come up with some mistakes or some spacing issues or you rip yours pulling it out right now i do have backups up here okay page 35 unit 6 and you can put the student activity books away way you need one
okay who else put that away one guys if yours didn t come out perfect i d rather just give you a brand new one okay
times go ahead use this one here one that was a good that s great
ready so you could look up here and you can also look at your sheet because what you have in front of you is exactly what s on this overhead
can you turn off one light okay it it s decimal can everybody see this
fraction now hi up we are just starting a lesson on this fraction to decimal division table pencil can you sit where that blue pencil box is right there
grab a pencil and we just gave out calculators you want to use these small blue ones or do you want to use a no i need you right here do you want to use that one or do you want to use one of these
right i m going to adjust your calculator and what i did is i just adjusted it so that it carries out 3 places to the right of the decimal
okay so your answers will only go to thousandths all righty okay bottom so what do you think this column is going to be
do you think that s going to be numerators or denominators denominators okay okay what what decimal would i put right there
at do you think it s half yeah okay and how do i say half as a decimal
okay so we can go ahead and write 0.5 pencil don t want you using pen on this chart
i need a pencil all right can you come up and get it please how could i use my calculator to come up with this what buttons do i press on my calculator to get that j one divided by 2 okay and did everybody do that just to check it
okay where else look at this sheet
where else on this sheet what other cells do you think we would occupy with 0.5 calculator 42 divided by 4 so where would that come on up here and point to where that cell would be come on up
44 fourths careful denominator it s either right here or who thinks it s right here where he has it hand okay i think the other thing was talking about was putting it here here okay
why don t you use your calculators cause i think you know what numbers to enter into the calculator he s right he is right there how many groups of 4 are going to go into 2 half of it
n you could do you can sit down all right hold on a 2nd now i would say that there are 4 more places on this table where i could put 0.5 student okay
come with me this way hi i just can t have i can t come into the room cause i m halfway through the lesson can he hang out hang out with you for about half an hour
okay who s going to come up here and help me out here come on up here and take your chart with you yes you can yep did you ask to use the bathroom no
a come on up and then you 2 girls can do the last 240 i think you re right let s see
one where are you going okay what did you do here
okay great 4 that s very nice of you
may all right not bad there now it gets a little tougher that s fine
you now if you don t have them here or you put them in a different place please change them now now what do you think the decimal equivalent would be for this cell right here
nice but you know if i wanted to use my calculator i m not using it what buttons would i press one divided by 3 that s right you would do one divided by 3
one how much of 3 fits into one this 12 fingers one finger right one finger
0.13 not 0.13 0.013 careful 4th no see i have 3 fingers here and i want to take one of these fingers and put it in here
i put less than half of this in here so it s less than 0 it s less than 0.5 okay i guess it s kind of tough to say is it is it less or more than 14th i think it s more
guys it s more than 11.5 because if you put them into the 33 and 13rd okay so so said something pretty interesting here he said he came up with this
calculator and your calculator said that it was 33 and a 3rd no 0 and 333 thousandths 0 i like that that noticed well he knows that his calculator reported this in thousandths so he said 0 and 333 thousandths nobody can say it better than that
perfect okay so this is what your calculator said 0.3333333 okay together 7 okay so this is what yours said
now the people that have these calculators remember we programmed them when we started to stop at 3 place values to the right of the decimal and that s why if you have the larger calculator it stopped there like yours okay called i have 3 3 so you what did you do to get that
i did fix 33 divided by one okay now so you needed to say one divided by 3 instead of 3 divided by one when you say 3 divided you go it now
3 if you say it different you say one divided by 3 that s taking the bigger number and putting it into a smaller number so it s going to be less than one whole and now we have the decimal now to answer this question about what s going on here it s very important okay it s called a repeating decimal okay that s the mathematical language for it this is called a repeating i think that s a it s called a repeating decimal right
and that just means it will carry out the 3s forever we stopped it here because we don t have enough room on our charts to write 73s if your calculator had more than 7 spaces you would have more than 73s going across
that why is it why doesn t it why won t it stop
let s say i have this big brownie okay i have a brownie and i have 10 i m sorry how should i say this
okay i have i have this brownie and i want to share it with 3 people if i shared it with 10 people everybody would get a 10th of it right but if i want to share it with 3 with 3 people okay and they each get a 3rd here s the problem
we could say each person if i broke this into 45678910 okay so this would be a 3rd this would be a 3rd this would be a 3rd not a 3rd i m sorry this would be 3 tenths 3 tenths 3 tenths and 3 tenths right
110th so in that 110th everybody can get 3 pieces of it right so this would be one piece this would be the next piece and this would be the next piece and there would still be this piece left over 0.33 that s what this part is when we did this part that s another 3 but now we have this part
we d have to divide this into thirds as well and that would be the next 3 really i think split the brownie up it s because it goes back to the base 10 we re in a base 10 and when you do thirds it s going to just take it to 9 there s going to be that one piece left whether it s 110th 1100th whether it s 11 thousandths do you guys know where i m going here i multiple students yeah kind of
well with a fraction you can just say a 3rd and it works but with decimals it s going to repeat out forever okay goes it s a conversation we can probably have a little bit later but we need to move along okay you what part are you getting lost on 0.33333 yeah that you too
does anybody want to help me explain it it i know explain what it comes down to and we ll try it one more time but you need to pay attention okay
what it really comes down to is that if we re dealing with fractions okay we can say if you have 99 cells okay and you want to break it into thirds that s going to be 33 cells 33 cells and 33 cells percent now we could always just make it a fraction and say 33 cells and 13rd
thing but if we just continue to make it decimals we re always going to have that one part that has to be divided and that just carries the 33333 okay it s called a repeating decimal and we can talk more about it information i think you re still a little cloudy on it and that s okay to be a little cloudy on it guys
what you need to know though is that in the case of 13rd in decimal format it does repeat out it will just keep repeating out cause you have to keep in chopping up that last piece as it keeps going out so we can go ahead and put that in and remember we re not going to go past what did we say right right here
okay anybody see another place where we could see 0.333 we re going to start using the calculators for the whole thing in just a little bit but what s important guys is we don t want to forget all the work you did in unit 4 what s that portion with fractions
fractions now what we just did with 0.5 we found out that one divided by 22 divided by 43 divided by 6 what are those called
0.5 i m looking for an equivalent for 0.3331 okay go ahead
one anybody have another one okay somebody you ve already been up right around did you use your calculator to find that or did you just see a pattern
okay everything okay huh it s in memory okay
fine okay i found one so we will see some patterns here and that s what i want you to look for because that s going to be our discussion what patterns you see
one look at this brave man him yeah yeah okay
here we see one divided by 3 we see that 13rd or 0.333 part of 3 will fit into one we see the same thing happen here with 2 divided by 6 how many groups of 6 will fit into 2 well 13rd of it will or in decimal format 0.333 we see that again here with 9 and 3 and again with 4 and 12
yes okay hold on hold on to that calculator i really want to stick with the fraction to decimal division table okay instead of fix 3 you can just do a different point like you want to show me what you re talking about
like this one right here if you if you do one divided by 3 you still get the same answer and what did you hit
it okay today you re going to complete this sheet but you re not going to do several of the rows
later the rows that i want you put a little circle around these rows here and don t do them and they are 7 do not do 9 even though we did sneak one in there
11 so those 3 don t draw lines through them cause we are going to complete them later but for today s purpose the other rows that we re going to do which are 1234568 10 and 12 they really are the rows that show us our best patterns for our discussion that we re going to have about it if you think you see a pattern going check it out make sure it is an established pattern okay that you re not going in the wrong direction and then see what that can do
in other words i m saying if there s areas where you don t need to use this don t okay yes you may work with a partner and you can discuss this with a partner you guys i m sorry but you need to stay put you 3 okay
about you started this on your own you all have calculators of choice here let s just start let s just do this on our own okay why can t this thing work go ahead
let s get going let s get going guys i m interested in what that was about what you did there
see so this one here is not set in f 3 but if i hit fd okay i just went like this this this this and this came up and i okay i don t know if you have to go back to it each time or if the calculator stays in that mode 0 you have you have to go back to it
okay so you got your your thirds in there and you got your halves
i was going to do the sixths and the eighths can you guys please stop banging on my door we need to take care of this guys
now so where are you starting spot you did this one right here 6 divided by 12 yeah okay happened it s so you know what it looks like
it looks like this 4 and 8 and this 5 and 10 it looks like this should have been here okay make sure that you are cross checking your cells you know what i mean you re starting here and you re dividing these numbers into these numbers
so this goes here well right now i want you to take 6 hit 6
get 6 okay so now take 5 and divide it by 10 and i think you ll find that you do have to slide that over okay so that you were just off there these sheets tend to use a lot of eraser material when you re doing these sheets
over at 1st i had this but then i saw the overhead and i changed it overhead it s on the 5 and the 10 not the 6 and the 10 did you get screened for glasses huh what did they say when you got screened for glasses do did you get a letter okay so make your changes
okay now until you start seeing patterns going to you might want to discard the strategy of like hey i m going to complete this row what one divided by okay it i ll get you an eraser for this
along what s this there then obviously if you look at it that s 6 divided by 12 get one.0.0 okay one there use this pencil too in case you need an eraser
be one no 2 divided by one what would be your step after that okay complete a row see where you stand and then work on another row and i think you ll start seeing patterns after you finish up your 2nd row
may 2 put your calculator up here got okay i did 4 divided by 60 you are just looking for patterns right off the bat
it so you did 4 divided by 6 and 8 divided by what about these 2 patterns what s up
you okay look you re trying to populate these cells right and you know that this is your numerator and this is your denominator so in this case if you just go across this 1st row for starters you would take one divided by what calculator not look for new buttons to push but just do what you know
one now if it s one you just have to carry it to 10 go well doesn t one divided by one equal one there do don t i do you do one
work yep thing these calculators they re built to be desktop calculators okay handheld you re going to have more success if you just left the thing on the desk
in this case i m hitting okay so that was right you do have to go through a few of them you just can t do it on you re not doing anything over here did you divide one by one
why don t you start right at the beginning okay so you write down one value okay now do the next 12 divided by one
start populating 0 you start to forget what s going on here doing not so good can i use the other calculator you sure can
what are you doing i m trying okay
calculator you need to start getting some cells populated 2nd what i see going on walking around the room is i see some students that are just looking at the whole table and they re just trying to find patterns great that means you re looking into the fractions and you re trying to use your head to reason them okay
this they re attacking it and their strategy is to attack it like this and i m fine with this too is to just say okay i m just going to across and i m going to be methodic this i m going to go across i m going to divide my numerator by my denominator and i m going to just start plugging in and i think what happens in this which is good too is that you start populating cells and then you get to a point where you really do start seeing patterns okay it s okay to stretch your mind and really try to find them on a big blank table
wonderful but if you come up to a point where it s really hard for you to see them why don t you start doing this and then you ll start seeing the patterns develop from there okay i don t want you to wrack your heads too bad with what you already know about fractions it s okay to use the calculator okay and to have a method for going forward the key is if you use a calculator you ve got to keep your fingers moving you ve got to stay with it may do we do these you re not doing 79 and 11
alone can we go like up and down or do we have to yep
that s good pencil let me get you a pencil you need a pencil on this because we do make mistakes on a project project like this
no you don t do and we did the no forget about this across so don t do this row don t do this row and don t do that row
up i m confused because i was trying to do it this way and then it said 0.100 and then here too it said 0.100 and then it started really
0.100 i put one divided by one and okay one now and listen if it s just if it s all these zeroes you can just write one because this is a 0 this is a 0
it only bring it out 3 place values if there s numbers besides zeroes in those place values okay in particular your hundredths or your thousandths but then do you put like a one and then 2 or no then yeah well we re doing the top 11st right this is our numerator 2 divided by 13 divided by 10 cause i was doing it the other way i know and this that s how you re getting these
okay you re making the dividend smaller than the divisor right you re used to seeing a bigger dividend you take the divisor and see how many divisors fit into the dividend and now the divisor is bigger so it s like it s like i ve got 3 fingers and i ve got one finger over here
them and normally when we were doing the 1st couple units we were like okay i ve got one finger and i ve got a box that holds 3 fingers answer to do that the divisor has to be greater than the dividend
why don t we go about 5 more minutes okay put in what you can and then we ll stop later it s not really expected that we get the whole thing done right here in this session okay what is expected is that we do start to see some patterns and that we can talk about them be quiet take 5 more minutes and then we ll stop and we ll just see what we ve come up with so far okay
here show me how you got that answer again okay and you re doing this one right here right
numerator i mean you did it it was fine up to here one look at this one here this is one divided by 5
0.2 let s see here
no why are you hitting this 1st you have to stick with this 11st you re hitting this 11st 1st and you re doing it here but can you check these 1st 3
around guys i m seeing a lot of students they re being consistent at the beginning and they re you know if our chart let me put the thing back up
when we discussed this like let s take a look at the fifths okay cause that s what we re doing here is fifths get okay 0.2 and i m just going to now after that there were zeroes right so i m just going to leave it at 0.2
i could say 0.20 or 0.200 but i m just going to leave it 0.2 because it s all zeroes after that okay 0.2 is good enough key then what you would do is you would divide 2 by 5 and what did you get 0.4 and what was the next one 0.6 and 4 divided by 5 is what
0.8 and 5 divided by 5 one right 15 goes into itself one time exactly now i saw more than one student they got to this and for some reason they started using the 51st and they said 5 divided by 6 and they went back to the old way of doing things right
we re keeping this up here as our numerator okay guys so it has to continue it has to be 6 divided by 57 divided by 58 divided by 5 did anybody get to 6 divided by 5 and what did you get one.2 and how about 7 divided by 5 one.4
one.4 do we see a pattern j it s like multiples of 2 yeah i could see why you would say multiples of 2 because it s 2468 but how much has this gone up
20 20% what percent and 20% is what fraction 2 tenths 15th okay
that how many fifths if 20% is 15th then 40% must be 2 fifths 2 fifths that s 60% how many fifths 3 fifths 3 fifths how many fifths 4 fifths how many fifths 5 fifths how many fifths 6 fifths 6 fifths or one and 15th so how much is this going up by each time
15th 15th there is a pattern this i mean i could just write the rest of this out without using my calculator now couldn t i time did anybody else see a pattern going across 2s they go by 5s okay so that sounds okay
it s a what did you get i did 0.5 what did this come out to 0 one well i can see that because 2 divided by itself is going to be one whole right one.5 right now while you check your calculator don t look for new buttons just do what i m asking okay divide 3 divided by 2 and tell me what you get
one.5 excellent i want you to clear your calculator and i want you to divide take 4 divided by 21 and i want you to do 5 divided by 2 2 and what did you get with 5 divided by 2
2.5 and 6 divided by 2 pattern it goes up one half each time or 50% across this is when the thing starts getting filled up pretty quick
and i think when you get out maybe here i need to check myself to make sure i think at this point i would take 11 divided by 5 and make sure i come up with 5.5 did anybody will somebody do that for me just to make sure that i didn t get ahead of myself
2 point what 11 divided by 5 11 divided by i m sorry 11 divided by 2 again 11 divided by 2 okay
people don t be afraid to suggest a pattern that you think is happening but you re not sure see divided by 6 30 31 for 2 divided by 3 so 2 divided by 62 divided by 6
0.333 i m talking about on the 2nd row you re talking about this row 12 divided by 6 well 2 this is the 2nd row 2 if you re going to say 6 i ll start here 1st but you said 2 divided by 6 so 2 divided by 6 is right here
6 divided by 26 divided by 2 you got 3 yeah good i don t know if that s a 00 it is a 0 it s 3 okay somebody else with a pattern
how about the eighths let s talk about the eighths what did you get when you divided one divided by 8 0.125
s 12 and a half it s 12 and a half percent we know that an 8th is what percent 12 and a half and 2 eighths is what percent 25% well i d be willing to bet then that i could just go ahead and write 0.25 there couldn t i
and i know that 3 eighths is 3 groups of 12 and a half percent 37 and a half percent so that s 0.375 37 and a half percent this is where we see the equivalency of our fraction work from earlier in the year start to really pay off you re not really following along with this and consequently every once in awhile you say i don t understand this but when i look up at you you re really not doing the work
here so we know that 4 divided by 8 we already showed that as an equivalent of 0.5 how 5 eighths that s got to be 50% plus another 12 and a half percent right
okay again we re seeing the connection between the fractions how we can use the fraction work that we already did this year to help us with the decimal work you have to use the calculators somewhat but after awhile you can convert and say hey we re working eighths right here so this has to be 0.6251 how about fourths we did a lot of work with fourths when we divide we take one divided by 4
0.250 point what half gosh if i i ve only done 2 here but i d be willing to bet i could start a pattern what would i put here 0.75 so i m going up by increments of 0.25 each time right
so that would stand to reason that this next one would have to be one and my next one would be one.25 and i ll bet this one is one.5 it somebody divide take 6 divided by 4
one.5 okay i m going to stand over here and we re going to finalize this thing by one student telling me of one other pattern and then we ll stop and when we meet again we will finish these you ve already given me a good one sheet 0 we did patterns tell me about a pattern
pick one pick one of them whether you re talking about thirds halves fourths fifths notice guys the left hand column that 5 stands for fifths that 8 stands for eighths so that 10 must stand for tenths
sheet what were the patterns the patterns were going by like 110th equals 10% okay a he s recognizing that this 1st one has to be 110th
0 one what s 2 tenths 0.2 time and that means when i get to 10 tenths and i get from here to here what should go here
one i think what happens with this sheet guys and we re going to do this a few times just like remember that sheet 11 in the what s the portion sheet 11 with the fraction percent equivalent sheet this is kind of that sheet in this unit and it s worth doing several times and you ll find out the more you do it the more you ll see patterns
heads this one okay today you want to continue with the fifths 0 i think we carried the fifths i think we could still do the sixths the thirds i think the ones are pretty straightforward huh
all yeah no that one is the hardest teacher how twelfths is the easiest you think twelfths is the easiest twelfths would be the hardest twelfths would be the hardest one that would be some real calculator work because we did sixths and we talked about how you could figure out a 12th by breaking a 6th in half but we didn t go very far with that i twelfths to use a calculator you used the calculator right you did the twelfths without a calculator he didn t do any of this problem tell me wait a 2nd
did tell me what you did for twelfths what was the pattern 0.083 and what so 0.083
is that a 12th is that 112th yeah what s 2 twelfths 0.167 what s 3 twelfths 0.35 here i know that 3 twelfths if i really look hard into that fraction i can see that it s a 4th right
it s an equivalent of 14th and i know for a fact it would be 0.251 this is a 6th right and so we know a 6th was 16 and 2 thirds percent i mean that s kind of a hard one to remember but that s pretty close with that 16 and 7 tenths so that s how they re doing it with a digital read out this one i could never figure this one out without a calculator and i ve been teaching this for awhile
so i mean power to you if you can do it but i think that sometimes the calculator is our friend to use for stuff that it s just a little too ridiculous for our minds to try to get a handle on but it s really cool when you can really look for the patterns and let your mind do a lot of the work that the calculator would do here take one divided by 12 and tell me what that is cause he did it in his head
0.083 beautiful all right head 6 and 0.67 and then divided that by 2 you broke that in half good okay nice work and good explanation too
down you guys have to get to teacher s room kids okay you guys need to make sure your names are on these put this in your math folder folder you can leave the calculators on the desk and everybody can say goodbye to the camera
girls we are going to review geometry and measurement not next week but the week after you re taking what test
test so we want to review everything we ve gone over this 9 weeks tomorrow you re going to be taking the final measurement test and i want to make sure that everybody s ready and able to get 100% area raise your hand if you remember the formula for the area of a rectangle
up put your hand up if you remember the formula for the area of a rectangle d length times width is the formula for the area of a rectangle units so right here i have a rectangle
if i wanted to find the area what do i do count up only 2 sides count up 2 sides yes but there s a lot quicker way to do that isn t there
length 12345678910 what s the length width 123456 here 7070 so the area of a rectangle is the length times the width
tell something that we would need to find the area of pool a pool now do you think you would find capacity for a pool
pool say you were maybe planting grass in your back yard okay and you were going to the store to buy seed has anybody ever helped mom or dad put seed down in the back yard to grow grass okay is that flat area yes okay now say you had a swimming pool in your back yard
no okay so in that case you might find the area of the swimming pool and then subtract it area say this was your backyard but it s a lot bigger right so say it had a swimming pool in your backyard and it took up this space here here and i wanted to plant grass everywhere but your swimming pool well then you d find the area of your swimming pool and you would subtract it out
but if you were filling the swimming pool with water need is the capacity okay k the computer screen yeah you could maybe find the area of the computer screen okay something else where you d how about how many notice when we walk down the hallway of the school what do you see on the floor
like squares squares so if we were ordering new tile for the hallway would that be area yes we would measure the length of the hallway and then we would measure the width the width of the hallway even if the squares were exactly a foot that would make our job pretty easy because it would be square units okay who remembers the formula for the area of a triangle yes base times height divided by 2 base times height divided by 2
that yes what s another way to write that half half if we re finding the area of a triangle why do we cut why do we cut it in half b we do that because a triangle is half of a rectangle yeah
rectangle in fact when i made these this morning here s the rectangle i made okay area 70 square inches 70 square inches units then i made this triangle and look what i did i just have the same size piece of paper it s 10 across the bottom okay
high and i wanted to show you how that triangle or remind you as most of you know how that triangle was exactly half of a rectangle oops should i be able to take these pieces and put them over the top this and telling you this is exactly half of 7 times 10
keep that in your head because i m going to be asking somebody what the area of this rectangle is here and cover exactly like puzzle pieces
top so the triangle is always half of a rectangle okay what square units what kind of units
yeah those are inches so one half of the base times the height what about the area of a parallelogram who remembers that one
j base times height base times the height parallelogram base times the height and how do we get that that if i draw kind of a free handed quick parallelogram here on the board do i measure this line right here height i think you know at the end i can put it on the other side
so based times height is the formula for the area of a parallelogram how about a square yes yes and what does that stand for when we say s times s side times side side times the side that what s another way to write that
you could write s to the 2nd power yeah or side squared like that side perimeter what s perimeter mean mean perimeter is the it is the what what s perimeter it s the length some of you are drawing it
c it s length times width times 2 okay length plus width times 2 that s for a rectangle right length plus the width times 2 that why do we do length plus the width times 2 if i wanted to find the perimeter of this we said we said the length was 10
7 so why do i go length plus the width times 2 yes all around yeah we we re not just taking one length and one width because see there s 2 sides that are the length right
width so we multiply by 2 because we re doubling who remembers the formula for the perimeter of a square ooh now if i can i turn this into a square by doing some handy folding square by the way what would what would the dimensions be if i just folded this back
now the width the width what was the width 1st 77 and i just folded 3 back so now 77 okay perimeter the area would be 7 times 7 which shown here is 49 square inches do times 55 times what
there how many 4 side times 4 yes we re going to do for the perimeter of a square side times 4 okay
boards uncap those markers and everybody should have a tissue on their desk that i passed out erase all right
right down the formula for the area of a parallelogram real quick and hold it up so i can see it nice and big write down the formula for the area of a parallelogram aha good base times height
now write down the formula for the area of a triangle triangle and there s so many different forms is yes yes yes that s a parallelogram you have to divide it by 2
way it might be a good idea to put parenthesis around it the base times height good job job okay you can put those boards down for one more write down the formula now listen carefully for the perimeter of a rectangle
the formula for the perimeter rectangle 0 width you wrote l w that means multiplying
remember you re not cutting it in half it length plus width times okay put those down and just listen to me who can tell me what they think the most common mistake and i saw a couple of kids maybe 3 or 4 kids making this mistake
what s the most common mistake when kids are asked to write down the perimeter of a rectangle what s the most common mistake they put length times width yeah width that s the formula for the area right area why would you double the area just to tell me how far around
these how many remember in 3rd grade you learned length plus width plus length plus width how many remember that them so it s length plus the width times 2 see that from about 4 or 5 kids and i want you to do that again write down the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle this doesn t work write down again the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle
is not working here s a working marker length plus width times 2 those set them on the floor
floor put the marker on your desk so i can see you re going to use it again and in your notes we re going to set up this morning for circles shh what is pi equal to
okay how many know what the radius of a circle is tell me what that means circle kind of give a definition in your own words when you think you have a really good definition down for radius raise your hand and tell me what it is
l the line segment that goes exactly halfway a line segment that goes exactly halfway across that s not a bad how about if we say what s this if we put a dot right here that s the center that s the center of the circle good say it s a line segment that goes from the center of the circle to the side of the circle okay
and i understood what she was saying when she used that word half because how do we figure out the radius if we know what the diameter is let s say we re told that the diameter was 6 inches
2 so if you were asked the formula for radius if you re given the diameter you would say what you would say diameter divided by 2 equals the radius
diameter it s the line that it s the line segment that pretty much cuts the circle in half half okay does anybody know what a cord is
cord if i put a point here and a point here and i went from here to here that s not a radius is it it we call it a cord okay
think to the center it does it goes right through the center what can we say about it s length in relationship to other cords
but it s the longer who s what the longest yes okay the diameter is the longest the longest cord on the circle think does a radius fit the definition of a cord
radius if we knew the diameter and we divide it by 2 we can get the radius if we want to figure out the diameter and we know the radius what would we say diameter okay now let s talk about the formulas we learned
area do we need to know radius for that formula radius we re going to figure out the area of the circle
write down from memory what is the formula for the area of a circle and then raise your hand and you can tell me the rest i know we haven t talked about circles for about 3 weeks it raise your hand
me i m only seeing about half the hands in this room up yet what is it area is the amount what s the formula it would be the amount of square units inside the circle but what s the formula
k the area is pi times 3.14 squared remainder squared mean okay i like the way he gave me pi
3 and 14 hundredths but how do we write that formula r 3 that s part of it 0 ooh the pi sign the symbol yeah
that pi times radius shh pi times radius squared times radius okay you re going to see boys and girls listen you re going to see a lot of geometry on your crct okay
so when we review this how many think this might be a really good idea to go home and study some more tonight okay i want you to i want you to do a good job okay i want you to learn this stuff so it will be easier for you when you get to 6th grade ahead take out your white boards again here i have a circle
and i m telling you that the radius is 3 inches i want you to work out the area of this circle if if the radius really were 3 inches what would the area be done okay
i like how some of these kids instead of just saying 3 times 3 times 3 and 14 hundredths they just went ahead and they went 9 that it s radius squared it s radius squared right show me the units in square inches okay don t just don t just tell me 28 and 26 hundredths don t just tell me that
here 0 you want to have inches squared that inches squared okay very good
good all right again how many kids remember the formula of finding the circumference
i m going to give you a minute to put your stuff away because some of you are still drawing on the boards minute my goodness 12345 kids can tell me how to find the circumference okay now i see try and figure out circumference
yes circumference is pi times diameter write that down diameter so now look up here boys and girls
if the radius was 3 how would you figure out the circumference if the formula is pi times diameter am i going to go pi times 3 am i going to go am i going to say pi times 9 again do what am i going to multiply times the radius is 3 but i need to know the diameter to figure out this area
66 times what 6 times 6 okay 0 this write down an explanation of circumference of a circle circumference write it down and then raise your hand and explain what does it mean
circumference what does that mean write it in your notes mean write it in your notes what does circumference mean mean the distance around the circle it means the distance around the circle
circle now if we wanted to find the distance around the circle we need the diameter right and the diameter is not 3 but what 66 can try a little experiment maybe later this week to kind of reinforce this
board pretend this was a paper plate okay plate now if i had a paper plate and i took a piece of string okay and i stretched that string exactly across the center of that paper plate what would that be
diameter now if i took that piece of string and i started to try to wrap it around the edge of this circle about how many times could that piece of string go around the circle g 3 and a little bit more 3 and a little bit more very good yes you ve done that before with teacher f
right so you should know okay the formula great okay the test tomorrow is going to be on measurement customary units and metric units 1st of all we re going to talk about customary units for length
in your notes turn to the page where you set up measurements customary write down 3 different customary units we use for measuring length length inches there s one what s another one yards there s another one
customary feet right right okay there s inches yards and what if we want to measure a long distance miles now how many this is easy easy how many inches in a foot how many inches in a foot
12 inches 12 inches in one foot now what if i asked you . 6 inches is how much of a foot
g half a foot 6 inches is half of a foot because put this in your notes that s like 6 out of 12 inches what denominator am i using here when i m trying to find fractions of a foot 12 okay keep that in mind for when i ask you the next one
okay if i asked you 4 inches 1212 so 4 out of 12 inches
g 3 fourths no no we re talking look here sweetie 4 inches out of 12
again 13rd 13rd 13rd all you have to do is put it in simplest terms okay 4 inches would be a 3rd of a foot now here s that kind of almost rule you see it
it now if i mark 4 inches and then i went to 8 inches and i count 4812 how many see how 4 inches is a 3rd
3rd 13rd let s put it in simplest terms i ll try one more then we re going to move on if i asked you 9 inches foot 9 inches is what do your thinking in your heads some of you are really good at simplifying fractions in your head
you re writing down 9 out of 12 inches
what denominator are you going to be using when we compare feet to yards yard 33 feet in one yard so what s our denominator going to be 121212 that s inches 30 my goodness 3 what s the common sense answer going to be
notes 3 feet equals one yard right so what would one foot equal
remember this remember this what would one colored in be it would be 13rd of a yard using
okay now i m going to give you why don t you go ahead and pick up your white boards again
boards 7 feet equals how many yards
fraction are you going to be writing a mixed number well 3 feet is one yard and 6 feet would be 2 yards so it s that and one foot more have 13rd what is it everybody 2 thirds excellent excellent how many think they get this
this we ll do one more just to keep you on your toes only this time i m going to put the yards down and you re going to tell me how many feet that would be that yeah write it down on your white boards
this 4 and 2 thirds of a yard be 4 yards what would 4 yards be ooh 12 feet yeah 4 yards 4 yards would be 12 feet right and then 2 thirds of a yard more
13rd is 12 thirds is 2 feet so what would 0 look at people i m seeing yeah very good
good so we how many think they get customary length as far as converting from feet to yards and inches one i m going to go i m going to go inches to yards how many inches in a yard
3636 so . half of a yard equals how many inches 18 half of a yard equals how many inches ooh i m seeing 3 kids with their boards up
everybody 18 inches i ve been easy on can you do that one i ll do that 12.5 that would be 5 feet customary save those cool decimals for 0
i think i got it what is it everybody very good okay shh thursday did she go over weight with you
yes how many say yes we did weight on thursday 0 yeah we did hush let s see what you remember let s see what you remember just write on your boards how many ounces in one
up write it on your board and write it down then i ll know who knows and who doesn t know i think we better take this test on thursday instead of tomorrow okay with you because you re telling me 16 ounces right 16 ounces in one
so shh if i asked you 8 ounces 8 ounces out of 16 what fraction pound yeah 8 ounces would be half a pound so what denominator did we use when we re converting assets to pounds everybody
16 what denominator 1616 so i m going to ask you know 14th of a pound equals how many ounces if a half a pound was 8 ounces and a 4th is a half of a half right yes show me with your white boards
up what a 4th of a pound is how many ounces a 4th of a pound is how many ounces
well wouldn t you just be asking yourself what s a 4th of 16 how many kids are telling me 4 ounces
ounces all right so last week last week i was really pleased with most of your test scores how many of you remember the little test i gave you last week on ounces and quarts and pints
0 yeah okay on your white boards draw the picture you would draw if i was asking you to compare quarts to gallons if i was asking you to compare quarts to gallons what picture are you going to yours
fold it draw it here okay show me the picture you d draw i know on the white boards yeah on the white boards quarts shh
now listen if you are going to the grocery store and you re going to buy a quart of milk tell me with your show me with your hands and your arms how big is a quart how big is a quart what does a quart look like
big go to okay right so if you re taking a test now pay attention you ve still got your picture drawn right yep shh look up here look at me
me and i asked you 3 quarts and you had just drawn a picture that looks like this that i drew okay that s 3 quarts out of how many
fraction 3 fourths 3 fourths 3 fourths 3 fourths is what 3 i knew it fourths of a gallon
here i want somebody to explain to me how you would use a picture like this if i did 2.5 gallons
how many remember a question like this on your test last week brave do i got any brave kids who want to come up here here all right
now have your markers have your markers right now board is going to explain how we use a picture like this if we want to figure out 2.5 gallons and then you re going to write in your notebook an explanation of how you do this
okay go ahead 4 quarts so it s going to be 5 quarts so you think there s 5 quarts in 2.5 gallons 4 how many quarts would there be in 2 gallons
0 boys and girls shh 2 quarts i commend you on being brave enough to come up here right plus a half a gallon more gallon would you cut it in half
how many would . okay so how many gallons are we talking about 10 how many understand how to use that picture
okay i m going to give you about 3 minutes to write 3 minutes to write out i want you to write an explanation of how you would use a picture like this 1st of all you see you re comparing quarts to gallons so what do you do
you draw a picture of the gallons with the quarts in it and if i ask you to find 2.5 gallons is how many quarts write an explanation of how you d figure that out
and then when somebody thinks they have a really good one and is really brave you can stand up and read it to the class wait what was the question again the question is you re going to write an explanation of how you use a picture like that if you re asked how many quarts are in 2.5 gallons
write how you d use a picture like this how to find the answer okay
read what you wrote then how would you use this picture to answer this question well there is 4 quarts to a gallon and you add 2 gallons that +8 then you put the gallon and a half equals 2 quarts so 8 +2 is how many how many so i m going to write another one up here and you re going to use the same picture and you re going to write the answer
this time on the white boards and hold it up so i can see that you understand it how do you know you know how we got are you going to be coming on thursday for class
did you see that note wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait now you re using the same picture
let s just say you see a question on the test are and the 1st thing you see is you are comparing quarts to gallons
gallon and then you see you re being asked 7 quarts 7 quarts not 7 gallons 7 quarts and look here at this picture for a moment those of you that don t get it those of you who get it just press on down those of you who are still a little confused you see how 4 quarts is one gallon
how many see that how many see that 4 quarts is one gallon what s left over from 4 if i m talking 7 with we ve got 4 taken care of 4 quarts in one gallon but i m asking 7 how many is left over then 330 i know what it is
see i got it 1st good for you yeah you did it it except i might have seen 0 very good
one since you get it since you didn t get it 2 minutes ago and now you get it i just want you to come up here and put it into words
good and could you even could you even just look at this picture and see well then there s 3 more 4 and get your 3 fourths all right m okay i m going to switch gears here but same idea
i m drawing a picture you would draw if we were doing see the question you see so many cups equals how much in a gallon draw the picture you would draw cups to gallons
up ah s got it beautiful beautiful okay
picture now we re going to use this picture to figure out the answers what s our denominator going to be if we re comparing cups to gallons 16 everybody 16 everybody 16 okay the denominator is 16 because there s 16 cups in a gallon
you need to make a square with 16 it looks like you re going to end up with 15 not 16 okay picture everybody knows that there s 16 cups in a gallon so if i asked you this if i asked you for 9 cups that s 9 out of what 16 you would be coloring in 9 of those cups and what fraction would that look like everybody 9 sixteenths yes
9 cups is 9 sixteenths of a gallon now let s see if you can get this one if you get this one right away i ll feel i ll feel pretty good
though i just changed it to thursday we need a little bit more review of metrics okay okay look up here look up here you re going to be asked a question comparing cups to gallons and you know there s 16 cups in a gallon so what if i asked you the fraction 17 cups 0 my gosh
there s 16 cups in one gallon so that s one gallon and a little bit more and that one extra cup would be 0 look at this this look at these kids with the right answer i have it too great great great great it was easy great great
how many kids how many kids that took the test last week didn t do so well and would like to re take that test to get a better grade me right so easy i got it does anybody is anybody still struggling with this cups to is anybody not getting this good are you having a little trouble with this i am
okay anybody anybody want to if you want a little bit more review with me what you re going to be doing is you re going to be bringing your boards your white boards to me the rest of you if you get it if you re understanding it if you got a good grade on that test last week and you know which one i mean right the one s with pints and quarts and cups and gallons and feet and yards you got if you got a good grade on that you can work ahead
i want you to open your math book to page 425 and taking that practice test on measurement and those of you who are still struggling a little bit i want you to come up here with your white boards and sit right down here in front of the boards
i ll check the thanks for reminding me shh
if we get finished early all right
1st of all the question i have for you kids up here with the boards is this how many how many studied and if i said to you how many pints in a gallon you could tell me right away
the 1st step the 1st step if you re going to do a good job of this is to have studied and know these customary conversions from pints to so i m going to ask you now gallon now there s 4 quarts in a gallon
guys do you know where in your notes you took notes on quarts and cups and gallons and if you don t know where in your notes to look i can show you in the textbook because that s the 1st thing you re going to be studying okay how many pints in a gallon everybody
study you re going to study things like 16 cups in a gallon okay so we ve established there s 8 pints in a gallon now you re being asked a question that s going to result in a mixed number for an answer right
it so go ahead and draw your pints to gallons picture there s your 4 quarts right is it one and 3 eighths yes it is good you didn t even have to draw the picture and you knew one and 3 eighths because if you know there s 8 pints
if there s 8 pints in one gallon and i m going to ask 11 okay wouldn t that be 11 eighths right doesn t 8 go into 11 once with 3 eighths leftover how many are getting it after we establish how many pints are in a gallon and you draw the picture
then is anybody having trouble getting the fraction when we do it that way this do you understand excuse me what would your answer be then for that one yeah one
more isn t that 3 out of 8 and one and 3 eighths you understand how to use this picture okay we re going to try we re going to try a different one how many cups in a quart cups in a quart write it down
ounces remember what cups look like remember i told you 0 yeah he wrote it down up no not 24 cups in a quart let me draw the picture
here when i ask you to draw a quart who is still drawing that skinny rectangle that looks like a quart of milk right right and then what do the cups look like
squares how many cups in a quart 4 i think i m starting to figure out why some of us have a little trouble with this me studied okay draw the picture for cups and a quart boys and girls
draw if it s asking you about cups to what quarts quarts okay 4 cups in a quart let me write yeah let s try this
how many cups would be in 3 quarts 55 if there s if there s 4 cups in one quart how many cups would be in 3 quarts 32 no picture 3 and 312 yeah thanks
trouble 12 okay okay move right over here so you don t is it that you just didn t remember how many cups were in a quart so do you think studying would be a really good idea you still have that because it looked like you were taking some beautiful notes last time okay
how many know exactly where in their notes this stuff is that we last week remember this morning i walked around and i looked at your notes
okay we ll go back
no who s still workin on this
do you switch i switch multiply i m going to put 3 over the 2 right yes what am i doin now you take one times 22 times 3 and 10 okay what do i do now
definitely so put 3 into itself one and 3 into 6 would be 2 so your answer should be that okay i m going to do one more and then you re going to have to start comin up here and doin them for me 13 times 26
right you re going to come up here and do 3 fifths divided by 2 thirds
go okay so got what
go 6 times 5 equals 3034 times 312 what happened here
it s an improper fraction okay it s an improper fraction what can we do with that remainder 6 over 12 so it would be 2 okay over 12 what s going to happen now to 6 over 12
happen she flipped both i m sorry her she had 3 over 6 divided by 4 over 5 up it s kind of messy but can you do it like maybe over the top of it big so it s 3 over 6
j pay attention okay okay now it s 15 over 24 fraction but if i have 15 over 24 can i break that down smaller
24 yeah 3 he said 3 let s try 33 into 15 would be 53 divided by 24 is you i m going to call you again so i want you to pay attention here i want you to do 2 fourths divided by 3 over 2 so guys when i touch the guy on the left
right i flip it okay and then i multiply it by the are you ready go stop writing pay attention okay so what she did was 6 over 8 she realized that 2 can go into both 6 and 8 and her answer became what
3 fourths so she divided 2 by 6 and 2 into 8 we saw that here okay so she has awesome but is she done
hand what number do you think we can put in that to simplify that 10 quite easy
635 the answer is
you we re going to do 14th divided by 2 over 4 i need to be able to see so try to turn so everybody over there can see it
here okay she has 4 times one is 44 times 2 is 8 can we do anything with that sure i m a bit confused 2 so you said 2 into 422 into 84 but is she finished no
what 4 when you see a 4 and a 8 nothing comes to mind you now we can t see the next one but does it say 16th the one that says 16th right here it okay we re going to have 16th times what 44 over 24 times one is
12 when i see 4 and i see 12 i know i can just look divide that real easily right 44 into itself one and 4 into 12 is 3 try again
5 not there this okay when you flip it it becomes one times 5 then they need to see
is 51 times 5 is 5 and 5 times i can t see is 15 when you see 5 over 15 what comes to mind use simplify i know but what are we going to do with 3 over 5 what can you use i can use the the 5 so 5 into itself 115 into 153 so the answer becomes
you you have a half divided by 15th okay so she did what
half times and she flipped it 5 over one so it becomes 5 times one is 52 times one is 2 there it s an improper fraction times 2 times and what s left over one over the 2 so it becomes what half okay take some time a couple of minutes and let s do this
6 i ll walk around and see how you re doing are you getting the hang of it so we have the 6 over 7 so 6 over 7 what am i going to do now that 6 over 4 now i m going to do what 6 times 6
367 times 420 right 28 so this is an improper fraction times one time right what s the remainder
is it 4 over 6 you did it right we can break it down to something smaller i m sorry
use you could try 4 right 4 into 369 and 4 into 287 so we have 9 over 7 right and then this is an improper fraction so we could do 7 to 9 is one time 2 left over over 7 you got it you practice that where are you
one okay let s look at it properly we have nothing over here that says 5 over 7 can you see up go to the front and look at what you re problem is
it s 6 over 7 divided by 4 let me see what you have okay now we can go what with 36 and 28
use 44 divided by 36 would be 9 right and 4 divided by 20 would be 7 so i would have 9 over 7 this is an improper fraction right time 2 is left over over 7 okay all right guys i know it s been awhile but let s look at number one
stop what you re doing number one stop what you re doing number one ready 6 over 7 right guys attention yes 6 times 6367 times 428 i look at this
what 444 divided by 36 is 94 divided by 28 is 7 fraction 7 can go into 9 how many times awhile okay let s move on to the next one
where is that 2 over 3 i can t see okay keep going where is number 2
job where is number 2 good job
can i see number 2 so 8 times 2 is 163 times 5 is 15 fraction there s no number that can go into both of them so i have to do 15 into 161 time
goin can i see number 2 awesome can i see number 2 awesome can i see number 2 where is it
let s look at it together you have 2 thirds right when you re dividing you re going to flip this one remains the same and flip this guy 8 over 52 times 8165 times 315 there s no number that can go into both of these numbers so we re just going to do 15 divided into 16 would be one time
it i m movin it up guys
job so we re going to have some people who are going to come up here to finish this up
go all right let s get started guys
who s going to do 2 thirds divided by 5 over 8 you haven t been up here right you re up
here okay so did 8 times 2 is 163 times 5 is 15
it yes so we re going to do 15 into 16 is one time remainder is one over
go right there we need space so remember let s not go crazy with the marker
yet you re up doing all right let s go half divided by one ninth
stop so he says 9 times one is 92 times one is 2 go did you go yet
let s go
okay so we have 4 over 5 times 3 over one so we ve got 12 over 5 so 2 and 2 fifths that s not the answer please
20 lord go 28s divided by 5 eighths let s go okay 7 over 8 times we re going to flip it
8 over 5 okay now we re going to do 7 times 8 56 times 141414 and 4 into 40 would be
times still an improper fraction so what s 10 into 141 time i m sorry 10 into 14 can t be 2 times times one or what can you use can you break it down
147 and 2 divided by 10 what 5 into 71 time and 2 over
job it s your turn
alone what number could we use use anybody want to help her
times 4 divided by 84 divided by 8 because 4 divided by 12 is what 2 improper fraction right so how many times can 2 go into 31 gone let s go
hurry honey 5 over 7 divided by one over 9 okay so clearly we can t think of numbers that can go into both of those right
so what we re going to have to do is see how many times we can get 7 into 45 job we have 2 more to go
baby have you gone you re up after that what does that say
9 times 4 is 368 times 7 56 it 44 we could do 9 times and 9 divided by 56 guys
94 you could try 4 no happens when we have 9 into 36 that could work but 9 into 56 does not so let s erase that 94 into 36 is 9 what about 4 into 56
1414 that s good one that s for
anything 4 times 4 is 16 and 9 times 3 is 27
272 272 and 277 we ll look at wait do we need our math our math folders folders no 77 is it taping right now
grade i did i said page 272 going all right let s go and look at our math essential question and it s asking how can how can quadrilaterals and polygons be identified and classified okay when you identify something what are you doing
what see if the how they re similar and how they re different you re a little bit ahead of us because you re on the right track but just the word identify it s kind of like figure out okay figure out
change yeah not so much change but if you if you see something and you are calling it what it is then you are identify identifying it so we can identify those as backpacks or you can identify a boy from a girl because of the way they look because of the way they look or a basketball from a football right
so when you identify something you i guess a part of it is yeah you you re all figuring out that it s kind of like what it looks like and the word classified means what it means to figure out something okay well you are figuring out but you re figuring it out in a certain way
describing okay well identifying is part of describing so i m going to add that to this over here describing but we want to identify them so we want to figure out what they look like and we want to describe them and then once we do that we re going to classify them
that means that we re going to put them into order in order or it starts with a g groups so i can identify a basketball a baseball a football but then what i m going to do is that they can be all classified under what group
type of sport type of sport balls right yeah so or sport equipment yeah or sport equipment you know so classified is kind of like putting into groups groups okay so since we ve already been going over quadrilaterals and polygons let s go ahead and do some classification of them
1st we re going to do some identifying and then we re going to put them into the groups so yesterday we talked about polygons a little bit and who can give me a working definition of a polygon g it s a closed figure with 3 or more sides and angles yeah good
sides polygon so we have a closed figure and 3 or more sides now what did we just do here with this polygon we did what
it identify we identified it because now we know exactly what we re looking for to identify a shape that is a polygon so we know it has to be a closed figure and we also know that it has to have 3 or more sides what else do we know about polygons if we need to identify them or if we need to classify them
they can be regular or irregular okay so we can have regular polygons and then we can have irregular okay and the difference between those are
sides and angles are the same okay even number even sides and angles 0 you guys are doing great
okay okay so then we went ahead and we identified our polygons polygons
trapezoid a trapezoid trapezoid is a is a trapezoid a polygon and i mean a what did we say we were doing quadrilateral yes okay
angles a polygon is a closed plain figure with straight lines polygons are named by the number of sides or numbers of angles they have polygons so notice it says triangle 3 sides 3 angles angles pentagon 5 sides 5 angles
angles so if we need to classify those polygons that we just named which one of these can we classify them in read regular yeah those are all regular because they had even sides and even angles
group the quadrilaterals aren t even a quadrilateral has 4 sides 4 angles angles it doesn t mean that the multiple students it doesn t matter different lengths yes say it louder it doesn t matter if it has different lengths it doesn t matter if it has different lengths
polygons now let s talk about our quadrilaterals and look at them in a different color and that is going to be on page 277
okay so quadrilaterals are very very similar as far as identifying and classifying because them 2 will also fall under different categories now they made like a really kind of intricate little diagram for us to follow but if you look at it closely okay so let me go ahead and why don t you go ahead and read that where it says special quadrilaterals
there are special types of quadrilaterals parallelograms square rectangle rhombus and trapezoid each has different features and some can be classified in more than one way use the diagram to help you identify each type of quadrilaterals the diagram shows that all rectangles are parallelograms and quadrilaterals so remember when we looked at this earlier and we saw that we can name these different shapes under all these different categories
yes a shape can fall under any of those ones that we want to classify depending if they meet the criteria for that particular shape so i think we did already one through 4 right so let s look at number 5 it says it has 4 congruent sides and no right angles 4 congruent sides and no right angles
a rhombus okay so we know that it can t be a rectangle and it can t be a square right
yes does a rhombus fit for our for our classification yes okay good 6 its opposite sides are parallel and it has 4 right angles opposite sides are parallel and they have 4 right angle angles
rectangle rectangle else yes what else can it be good now remember it says opposites are parallel so we know that how many pairs of parallel lines does a square and rectangle have
2 so that it means that in that it meets in that classification and then it says it has 4 right angles
one it is a trapezoid with 2 congruent sides
g it is a trapezoid with 2 congruent sides
with 2 congruent sides it s a rectangle well so there s 2 congruent sides a rectangle has 4 congruent sides parallelogram that was a little tricky which is very similar to a rectangle
okay so what we re going to do to make sure that we re really really good at classifying and identifying shapes what we re going to do is we re going to make wanted posters out of our shapes so what you have to do is you have to choose a shape you can choose a quadrilateral or polygon and you are going to make a description of it
so this is a wanted poster like you know when someone commits a crime and they re running from the law well we re going to make your shape an outlaw and what you re going to do is you re going to think of what shape that you want and then in the description you re going to not only identify it but you re going to classify it
you re going to pick a shape you re going to tell us what group it belongs to and you re also going to identify it in as many ways that you can inside of your description yeah can you write that down on the board cause i ll forget 0 your directions is here
description so i want for you to take out your math take out your math folders so that you can do it 1st and then you can do your final copy on this
and you have to have at least you have to have at least 3 things 3 things in your description about your shape
and remember you re describing it without you re describing it so you re telling like if you have to tell somebody exactly what you re looking for
like if this shape went ahead and took something from you and you needed to get it back and the cops said well what does the shape look like you have to say it has 4 angles and 2 pairs of parallel lines and 4 congruent sides and you re going to give as much detail as you can about your shape so that it can be found
you said what
stinks and i do want to put this outside so let s make sure it s our best work go thank you you just you don t have to do that
description that s all i want to make sure that you have your description down and that your spelling is correct cause remember it s going to go outside but you can use your textbook to help you so that you know exactly how to classify your shapes and you know exactly what you need to add to them so that they can be included inside of your poster
teacher yes i want to do a rhombus but i don t know how to draw one i drew it like that yeah and that s okay it s kind of like a sideways square yeah so i mean or like you know like this
so you just have to make sure that it s kind it s kind of like a sideways square or a sideways diamond or however you want to describe it and it would be even really cool if you could try to describe it like if it was like a real criminal
criminal yeah you know you can even say that 0 it s you know that like what they did did 0 i mean of course like how they look like so they can find him right like it has 2 pairs of parallel sides or congruent sides right exactly
beware you know this trapezoid you know stole candy out of my book bag and he s armed and dangerous so we tell them what he robbed and describe well your description of the shape is more important once you have that then you can write a little like something funny on the bottom about it you know that means i have to write really small but if you re not a perfect artist it s okay
your description and your identification is more important than than anything yeah can it be like other shapes or it has to just be one shape do i write on here and then you see if it s good yes
after we did all all like because like identify it after we make it can we like like put arms and legs yeah of course you can
and then a mask or something going to be like cool do that can you put it like right here you mean your shape
that yeah i know yeah what what does this that when they re saying i don t know i mean this is an irregular polygon but i don t i don t this is not like this doesn t have a name
hexagon you know i guess it would be when you have one of these like 0 it s an hourglass hourglass yeah are you saying that it kind of looks like an hourglass
0 okay that s a good that s a good i put a hexagon because it has 6 sides yeah it is a hexagon teacher huh class excuse me
yes can we like like write the name or something if you know write the name of what like the wanted person after you re done see i just did that to see if i got it right polygon i start with t
mean what do you mean by that put the book down
trapezoid what you can write that this is that your shape is a trapezoid like how you started up here i m a trapezoid or you can say i m looking for a trapezoid named does that say stinky sneaky i can t read that sneaky okay i am a i m looking for a trapezoid named stinky and i have 4 sides and 4 angles
polygon and then you can take out that because you already said that but remember you re the one that s writing the description about the shape so you have to you can t you can t it s not i am because the shape isn t the one writing it saying so i write i am a trapezoid my name is stinky
you say i am looking for a trapezoid he goes by the name stinky he has you know 4 sides and 4 angles and you can even add this and one exact pair of parallel sides the more descriptions you give the better your like the easier he would be to be found you know
if something went missing in your house and the police came and the police said well what did he look like and you said 0 he was wearing a red shirt is that going to help the police too much no a lot of people wear red shirts exactly a lot of people wear red shirts but you say 0 he s 5 3 and he s wearing a red shirt and a blue had and green jeans and he has glasses and a big nose you see how many descriptions i gave so that it s easier to find
okay okay let me see okay so can i can i read yours as an example okay so let s listen to s he said the hexagon is not regular and he looks like an hourglass
he confuses people that he confuses people that he is an hourglass and steals toys and candy great like he added part of the description and then made it a little bit fun also but i want you to also add that it s a polygon cause remember the more descriptions you give the better off this would be for someone to find him
and like i told you re writing this about the shape so you can say i m looking for hex i m looking for irregular hexagon or a or an irregular polygon that looks like an hourglass and you understand what i m saying okay just tweak that a little bit but otherwise that was great
like i put like this part and then like i put these in but like i don t know what else to like write a description about okay let me see example she said beware this rhombus is dangerous
it has 2 pairs of parallel sides i m sorry and 4 congruent sides done and then so you can go ahead and add that to your you can already do your poster now
good okay he has 2 parallel sides 4 congruent sides 4 right angles and has he is a quadrilateral okay and so is it a square or a square or a rectangle it s a square okay
so you can you can you can add that also in there that it s a square because that s another description can i read yours all right let s listen to s she said he is he has 2 parallel sides 4 congruent sides 4 right angles heads he goes by 2 headed and he is a quadrilateral and she s talking about a square and i also said well go ahead and add that he s a square because that s just another description of your shape
and then she drew a picture of like 2 square heads but a sad face okay okay
thank you this is cute can i read this one aloud okay so here s s this shape is a polygon polygon if you ever see him make sure you call 9 shape shape not 911
section it has 2 congruent and parallel lines and finally he is a regular square that robs banks so he could buy the most candy in the world if you find him hit him in the stomach and bring him to the police posters i like the vocabulary
and let s just double check our spelling okay because the words are in the book so there s no reason why we are not spelling the words correctly thing remember that you are the one describing the shape
no no i mean like figuring out what shape they re going to do and writing it
okay this shape is a rhombus he s sometimes described as a parallelogram he has 2 acute angles and 2 obtuse angles and he is a polygon he will hurt you if you touch him but he is a weird rhombus because his head is not ordinary but he can turn ordinary if you see him yell ah then look at him and then say hi and another person can jump him
okay these are going to look very cool outside description i won t read it out loud but i if you don t want me to but i just want to see you i didn t actually finish it because then why go on to this
1st you have plenty of resources here to use if you need help how do you spell disguise how do you spell dictionary we talked about that d i c well then go get one
okay okay went to my house and stole my paintings that were priceless but my family has this if you find him jump him and say freeze or i ll shoot 3 holes in your head like a bowling ball i got it off of a movie okay you re going to have to try to make that fit into there okay
12nd babe
angles this shape is it is a quadrilateral square demon demon bad and then when you finish adding your description you can go ahead and color it
it you ready or no i m ready okay teacher yes
how do you make a mean mouth i really don t know how to face like a mean face like when people are mad about i always end up making a sad face like if you just make a line that s kind of like a no face okay he is a square with okay then here
paper so that you can write on the lines not floating around congruent sides and angles he has 12 lives what does that mean he has 12 lives lives like he can come back to life 12 times
yes he stole a $1000000 from my bank account if you find this quadrilateral throw him from the tallest building you mean you want to add off right
this is that a girl shape it s a little girl okay he is a square he is a square with 4 parallel sides congruent sides and angles
account if you find this quadrilateral throw him off the tallest building 12 times cause he has 12 lives spelling okay okay a sad face it s off to the side
girl yeah huh do you want me to read it or you want to read it it 0 you want me to check it
okay can we color it yes when you finish you can color it and i checked it
can all right let me see yours 4 sides also has parallel sides
he s a trapezoid and a bad one give all the money you have you have got so don t okay good it s perfect and then right here you just have to write don t let don t let you said don t let
0 hair in the eyes let me see so i tried to 0 that was a good one you gave him like a well it was like a little black could have been a black eye but that s a red eye man well let s look at this
c an organized pictorial right of a sample space which is going to show us all the possible outcomes
okay i think one important thing that this site tells us that i left out is this diagram and we should record this in our notes under our tree diagram definition it shows one branch for each possible outcome
count each branch shows one branch for each possible outcome so for each outfit right we counted just the end branch so it s important to write down that the diagram shows one branch for each possible outcome you need to write that down please i did okay and then put your thumb up when you re done writing
your diagram shows one branch for each possible outcome and does anybody know why we use a tree diagram when we have a lot of information or we want to find out how many choices we have
does anybody know a it s like an it s a organizer it s like a graphic organizer remember those boxes that we ve been filling in with pants and shirts or bread and meat and cheese
if you just looked at the box and you didn t know the shortcut would you be able to guess the outcomes
job maybe you were a designer or you worked in some kind of industry where you had to know each possible outcome it s not okay to just say the outcomes there s 8 different choices because if that person that s in charge of you wants to know what each choice is you re going to have to list that right think if you were having a lunch okay
for a lot of different people and remember all the different ways we made sandwiches you would have to know each way each person wanted a sandwich okay here this is our 1st example that we re going to use okay
c you need to decide on your you can have white or chocolate milk to eat you can have a chocolate chip or oatmeal cookie how many different choices do you have okay so our tree trunks what part up here would be our tree trunks in this diagram
k the last things what . what words would we incorporate as our tree trunks k white milk and chocolate milk okay because aren t those our 2 main choices 1st drink so that would be our tree trunk
c chocolate chip cookies yes our branches are the chocolate chip cookies and the oatmeal cookies put your thumb up if you remember doing a diagram like this yesterday and the day before which diagram ended up having just a tree trunk and branches
do what sample space were we talking about that had just a tree trunk and branches yes our outfit right did and did you see how they checked their answers they took the number of drinks multiplied by their choice of food and they got 4 combinations
how can we make sure 4 combinations is correct c you count the branches you count the branches so your math check told you you have to have 4 combinations who can read our 1st choice that we can have 4 our snack
w and chocolate chip whit milk with chocolate chip cookies choice white milk with oatmeal cookies e chocolate chip cookies chocolate milk with chocolate chip cookies chocolate milk with chocolate chip cookies and your last choice
oatmeal cookies 0 . white milk no who can help him k chocolate milk and choc wait oatmeal cookies oatmeal cookies so we had 1234 choices okay
1st read it silently to yourself and then raise your hand to read it out loud to us please a how many different ways can you if you flip a penny dime and quarter how many different ways can they land
i know on your s 0 l test and on your next upcoming benchmark test you might see one of these questions like this on the test question they love to talk about money because what is the one thing we all love to spend money okay and what did they say about that dime nickel and penny
they gave us a tidbit of information in case maybe you re not familiar with coins us there are 2 ways of dime and quarter thumbs up if you agree with that
tails okay yes they can land on heads or tails so if we have these 3 they want to make a tree diagram a tree diagram what did they use to start out as their tree trunk
trunk their tree trunk because if we were to make that box like we did on our work disappeared hold on
board shh they re coming up i promise hold on i want to make that box like we did yesterday
paper we re going to draw the same box that we did yesterday when we had 3 choices okay we had 3 choices yesterday come on day maybe maybe not
job okay red line to red line now how many choices of coins do we have have 3 so how many spots in our sample space should we have 33 yep so we need to have 3 what is going to be our 1st one
talk remember when we write numbers they always start at least to greatest greatest we want to do that with our sample space since we re talking about money that has a numerical value penny what are the 2 ways a penny can land
land heads heads or tails heads like this and then tails so this way make sure you write out the words so you remember what these letters stand for okay what s the 2nd type of coin we re going to toss
a dime what are the 2 ways the dime may land tails heads or tails go ahead and use your letters this time what is the last coin that we re going to toss
a quarter the quarter even though they didn t start out with a sample space we are because if you have that sample space 1st sometimes it s easier to go to your diagram
if you just try to diagram it and you don t have your information organized it can lead you to some not so correct answers okay excuse me land heads or tails heads or tails now which one up here and i want you to draw the tree diagram okay
in your notebook that they have up here but we re going to draw it as we talk about it okay what value . what coin is going to be considered our tree trunk l okay can you pass this down to her what which coin would be considered our tree trunk
the quarter the quarter look up there and look at the order 0 that our coins were listed because we re tossing all 3 of these coins at the same time right penny the penny is going to be our tree trunk
this okay we re going to replicate their diagram together so the penny is going to be our tree trunk right what are the 2 ways that penny may land
k heads and tails heads or tails so i m going to do this so our heads and that s our tail right now what is the next coin we have after the penny dime what are the what different ways can that dime land the penny can land on heads and the dime might land on
or heads or heads so that means or dime might either lay on heads or tails right right thumbs up if you re okay with this so far
tails what is the next coin that we re still going to look at the the dime and what are the ways the dime might land heads or tails heads or tails so it might be penny heads dime heads or penny heads dime tails right
yes and it could be penny tails and dime dime heads or penny tails and dime tails tails okay do you understand what coin is going to branch off of our heads
sorry what coin is going to branch off of the dime which coin is going to branch off our dime i mean quarter the quarter does anybody remember what teacher c told you
we have our tree trunk or tree branches and what do we call that thing those things that grow off of branches j leaves leaves so we re going to think of our quarter as a leaf what is the one way a quarter may land
heads so it may land heads up down make sure you guys are writing this too please okay
now but can we also have penny heads dime tails and tails 0 wait i m not done what should i have done before i went down here i have penny heads dime heads quarter heads but am i not missing a choice
heads quarter . tails tails tails right what about if i had penny heads dime tails
fall how may it fall 1st it could have landed penny heads up dime tails up quarter tails heads heads up okay and you want to keep it organized that s why we stay in the same order
because if you start mixing up your leaves and your branches then that means your diagram might be off right happen what about if we had penny heads dime tails what could our what other way could our quarter land heads tails tails and you can draw this
we can have our penny with our little heads up right we could have our dime which is smaller than a penny for our little heads up and our quarter which is the biggest one right is that one possible outcome heads up heads up heads up
okay and then we said our 2nd outcome for our top branch was penny heads up dime heads up and then for a quarter it was what puppy there s it s tail
so i m not good at drawing i m not good at drawing okay so heads up heads up heads up heads up heads up tails you agree yes now let s do it down here for our bottom row we have our penny heads up and then what is our dime
tails are you drawing this check your partners make sure they re drawing their coins i m not an artist so you make sure you draw better than me okay here there s his tail s you have 2 minutes for your for that to finish before i take it okay
option we have penny heads up heads up tails up it should be a like it would be a heads heads up for what coin quarter the quarter and then what s our 2nd option them how should i draw them
up my 2nd coin heads up no tails dime dog coin tails tails heads up heads up heads up heads up heads up tails heads up tails heads up
heads up tails . tails tails i know it s a lot to take in see and this is why those pictures sometimes are more confusing than the diagram okay the diagram yep you think the diagram s confusing really ah okay it might be
on we had penny tails dime heads what s branching off into those little colorful leaves what coin s going to branch off my dimes
j heads or tails heads or tails right up how s my penny up it s right here on the board facing tails
right thumbs up if your dog looks better than mine then what comes after our penny the dime the dime and which way is our dime facing which way is our dime facing 1st
heads heads so much easier to draw a smiley face and then our quarter how s our 1st quarter facing heads heads can you say that yep penny tails dime heads quarter heads
and now let s do you on this one my 1st choice was penny heads penny tails dime heads quarter heads be it s tails tails okay now how is my dime facing
bit now i got it because it says dimes heads then yeah you re kind of following the trunk yep to the branch to the 1st leaf the trunk to the branch to the 2nd leaf right
favor slide your chair in and work on your desk so i know you can see the smart board it okay i just need to know you re paying attention now my 2nd way we have penny tails with what is our next branch coming off a what s our next branch
look at what we ve done compared to what we still need to do you know now
here we did penny tails dime heads quarter heads right penny tail dime heads quarter tail next dime tails dime tails and then what can come off of my tail of my dime quarter what are the 2 ways my quarters can fall
heads or tails tails okay and let s draw it okay who can tell me how my 3 coins should go 1st
ah heads no how should my next 3 coin choices go this i think a lot of you do you re just a little bit shy at the moment j it goes tails head tails done it
heads heads are already done c tails tails tails tails tails head we haven t done that yet here go tails tails head okay
tail what s my next choice
flipping just words
k tails tails tails tails tails tails how many choices did we have all together together well before we multiply we need to do something else because we have this lovely pictorial of our tree diagram
huh counting count what what are we going to count yesterday all the choices what did we talk about counting what part of our tree are we counting
n the last part of the tree the last part we don t count this part choices we don t count this part in our choices definition we said what s on the very end shows the one possible outcome right so can you tell me how many choices we have all together
8 she said 8 who can come up here to show us where got 8 see i don t know if she s right but that doesn t mean they re right either because you have to do it from the pictorial 1st k i think it s can you come up and point to where you think this 8 is coming from
shh 678 okay show us where you get 6 and i want you to pay attention so we can decide who is right
2468 okay so she counted 8 just a different way so thumbs up if it s 8 wrong and if you think they re wrong you got to come up and tell us why
think come up and show us where 8 is coming from yes i m looking for going to basketball okay 4688 okay so 8 is correct right
multiplication they took what we put in our box we had 2 choices for the pennies 2 choices for the dimes and 2 choices for the quarters is 88 okay so thumbs up if doing the pictures plus the graph helped a little bit no i get to about it
246 no we re multiplying 2 times 2 is is 8 multiply okay remember a tree diagram is a branching
tree like diagram showing all possible outcomes and you need to know that you only count the very very end branches whether you call them branches or you call them leaves you only count the very very end please don t do that okay you count the very very end
up thumbs down if you feel more comfortable with tree diagrams down okay if you recorded all the information today i hope you feel better about this
okay i want you to turn the page and at the top i want you to write we started this the other day no i want you to write lattice multiplication
100 shh what 30 okay the 1st here s the problem that you re going to write down okay at the top of your page the problem that you re going to write down is 324 times 28
down write it just like teacher c we want it to go horizontal vertically thumbs up when you have it down please you ve had plenty of time now because i need you to be with us
okay everybody back there got this written down it okay the 1st way we are going to try multiplying put a number one up here
we are going to do and it is called expanded in the box we re going to call it expanded in the box right expanded in the box is what i like to call it
you . when you start algebra in middle school teacher m told me her daughter goes to blair she s taking shh she s taking algebra and they do algebra in the box okay so those of you that like to frown upon my different ways of multiplication and division you will not be learning algebra the traditional way
you will be learning it many ways that being said we are going to do expanded in the box the 1st step in expanded in the box is expand what number are we going to expand 1st 30300 what 2424 tell me how to write that
300 +20 +4 times how are we expanding that 20 +8 okay you better have this down
on shh and we are going to draw a pretty big rectangle because you re not allowed to draw little rectangles box i don t care how many sheets of paper that it takes you on your multiplication part of or any type of part of your s 0 l test here even if it s just to work on a problem
i don t care how many pieces of paper it takes because it shows that you are doing your best and you want to get the right answer by giving yourself a big work area okay a big work area so we are going to draw a pretty nice size
the reason i say rectangle is because we have 3 digits here right 3 separate place values which means we have to have 3 columns pull the door shut please okay so since 300 what if we look at 324 what number has the biggest place value
30300 so it s going to have the biggest space in my box okay what place value has the next largest place value 2020 so it also will have a bigger area than my one s place right
how many place values do we have in the 2nd row of our multiplication problem 2 so we just have to take and divide your box into 2 lattice kind of builds off of this but it simplifies it sometimes down to the point where you don t actually have to have number sense to do this
this requires a little bit more number sense okay so expanded in the box we are going to take our numbers we have 300 +and we write our plus sign at each column break yeah yeah
shh shh +20 +4 thumbs up when you ve got put the shirt on boy you can t be naked in front of my cameras shh now what do we do with 28 go where do i what do i do with 28
put it down where going shh 28 where does 28 go okay and aren t we multiplying right put that in the corner so i remember what i m doing
okay just because i think zeros sometimes are the easiest things to work with 300 what am i going to multiply 300 times 20 i m going to count my zeros 23 i m going to plunk them right here
what do i multiply next 3 times 23 times 2 and what is that 66 thumbs up yes i don t get this like wrestling multiplication inside a box 3 times 300 times 20 no there s 3 sweetheart
23 we didn t do this one we re only multiplying times the 301st next 3 times 32300 times 88 so how many zeros do i have
2 and if you keep your numbers lined up it s going to help you in the end what is 3 times 82424 okay what s next multiply 20 times and what do i do
12 and then multiply 2 times 2 which gives you 4 okay so what s next 2 20 times 8 and what do i do 1st
t 8 times 2 which is 24 and see how i m keeping them lined up so when i go to add these later they re all in a nice row okay the neater that you work the better the payoff later
okay what s next 4 times 3 where is 4 going to multiply 3 though because we . we always want to meet at the corner
is we could do 4 times 8 but let s stick with the same rhythm 4 times 20 20 we kind of work the top corner 1st before we move down okay so what do i do 1st put down the 08 and then
4 times 2 is next times what 300 times 8 well if we look at our box what have we already done left what
4 times 84 times 8 which is 32 i m going to keep my numbers lined up now that we ve just done all this multiplication it s just the box way 0 it s just like wrestling multiplication but you put it in a box so those of you that were struggling with your wrestling multiplication homework teacher c you ve made me do extra numbers
i don t know how to do it now the same thing same thing shh do add them what do we add
1st 362400 i agree 0 to 0 gives us a 00 to 0 gives us a
0 a 000 +4 gives us a us 818 that s why it s important boys and girls to keep it lined up because if your numbers were all off you d have to re write this all on the side and take the chance of messing it up k 0 +0 which is
k the 0 and 6 then the 4 and the one which is 5 yeah we put our our plus sign here right q 0 +20 +2 and that is 28 +3 is 11 it s not so easy to add up anymore is it
no this is where you have to take your time and transport these numbers underneath of the largest number okay up so i like to run my pencil down it lightly
is 0 +220 +6 is 6 +175 +499 +110 carry the 11 +89 yes yes 9072 we re going to solve this another way
problem re write 324 times 28 problem re write it going horizontal again what sweetie shh why are you saying that
why are you saying that what stop please okay sit up please down up this time when we multiply we re going to do our wrestling multiplication okay this is just plain old expanded form
this is what we ve been doing since the beginning of october expanded form please write this down because when you have to do your homework this coming week you might want to take this math journal home so you have your examples
what do we do for expanded form 1st you re supposed to expanded form into the top right
k . 3 . 3 . 300 times . 300 +20 +4 times 20 +8 okay now what do we do next this is how your wrestling multiplication should be set up huh similar to this
i did the 4 at the top and 3 at the bottom right what do we do 1st what are we going to multiply 1st 300 times 20 and we re not going to solve 1st we re just going to set it up because we want to make sure that when we re solving we have our time to line it all up
j 300 times 4 in from the when we multiply don t we multiply top to bottom
we don t go straight across right no friend 200 times 888 now that we ve done both numbers what do we do with our 300 it draw a line through it
300 we ve done it twice right because that s all we have on the bottom of our problem n 20 times 20 now what s next
20 times 820 times 8 what can we do to the 20 now 20 we went 20 times 20 and 20 times 8 are we done with it
now 4 times 20 and what is next
4 times and 4 times 8 now are we ready to solve our problem 21st you got to put the 3 zeros yes zeros then what
times 2 is 6 add sit up please what s next 308 and how do we do that 1st put 2 zeros 2 zeros because 0 times 0 is always 0 and 0 times any other number is always 00 and then what
is 24 okay k 20 times 20 how do we do that 2 zeros and the 4 and you keep them lined up okay
next 20 times 8 you carry the zeros and 8 times 2 is 6 what is next you multiply the 4 times 20 and you get 8080 we bring our 0 over
c 30324 times 8 and i like to take my pencil when i have this many numbers and remind myself of my place values
preference 000002000066 +814 +31717 carry the 11 +45 +49 +110 carry the 10 no 26
7778989 do we get the same answer yes 90721 more way boys and girls way if some of you had other teachers i know they showed you only the old fashioned way
it right how many of you got your math test back today because your multiplication problem was wrong you shh ready number 3 this is lattice no and shh boys and girls we are almost done for the day yah and the same problem
324 times 28 this time there is no expanded expanding this number we are working on single place value this time place so we need to make ourselves a big old rectangle okay
you got to give yourself enough space c shh this is going to be the last one for today okay now how many digits are in our top number
wait shh i m looking to see if my back table s ready please put your thumb up if you re ready to move on
places 33 so i have to have 3 vertical columns okay and i m going to take this and split it up just like it says 324 i m not going to give it zeros or anything says how many numbers are in my 2nd one
22 so i only got 2 divided in half and i have 28 and again put your multiplication sign on the corner so it reminds you that these numbers are going to be multiplied against these numbers now only if you have a highlighter at your desk are you permitted to use it if you don t please don t get up to get one but i recommend if you do this at home you have a highlighter
who can recall the directions i told you how to divide your squares go ahead you make a line i you don t make a line e cut that the corners corner to corner corner what about up here to corner the 1st corner and stop right
yes because sometimes our squares our little boxes aren t always the same so we stop do connect this corner to the bottom right down what about this one
do you got down to the last corner the last the corner 1st corner corner to corner stop you keep going down find my next corner corner to corner and down stop find your next corner okay
1st your choice 3 times what 4 times 24 times 2 get 8 where do . where do my numbers go the ones ones so if it s 8 where do my numbers go
what goes here next times which is go i can t see turn around
chair what s next go 6 goes into the ones and the 0 goes into the okay my next set of numbers
c 4 times which is c make sure my 3 doesn t go down here it does not
nope right what s next is
j which is go which one bottom bottom bottom and my one goes up top what s my last thing i m multiplying times 38 times 3 which is 24 where do my numbers go
2 top or bottom where does the 2 go the 2 goes in the top or bottom does the 2 go the 2 goes on top and the i can t put my 2 here could why can t my 2 go here
a because the 2 is the . the 2 tells us we have 210s right yes point how do we add these numbers because i don t think they half of us know us i know who knows how to add these numbers up
go ahead up go ahead and use your finger and write the answers
here i shh we take our highlighter for a reason because the highlighter becomes our column 2 straight down
is 1717 our one comes up here one +011 +45 +166 +4100 i carry my 1299 then all you do is rearrange your answer
9072 it those are easy shh this week for your homework or this upcoming week for your math homework you have to solve you have to do 3 multiplication problems
231st 22nd you have to do one expanded in the box one expanded like we ve been doing the wrestling multiplication and one lattice so if you want to get a start on your homework for the weekend i would take my math journals home today okay so if you want to get a start on next week s homework it s a 5 day week so you have to turn in 12 of each
12 division 12 multiplication every day for monday you need one lattice one expanded one expanded in the box and then 3 division the way we ve been doing them sit down please i m not done i ve asked you to sit down tuesday you have to have 3 . 3 multiplication
one expanded one expanded in the box one lattice wait wednesday same thing expanded expanded in the box lattice thursday expanded expanded in the box lattice plus your 3 division every day those of you who did not do your homework with 3 by 2 i will not accept it next week if it s not so division is the same way
2324 divided by 28 okay now couldn t you sweetie when you do lattice multiplication or expanded i want you to stick to these formulas okay
these are the algorithms that i just want to give you the options of having different ways to look at the problems because you re going to end up choosing one way that you like to do it i want to make sure that the way you choose gets you the right answer not just because you think it s easier okay so yes you have to do all 3 ways next week one way each night okay well 3 ways each night
expanded expanded in the box lattice expanded expanded in the box lattice expanded expanded in the box lattice on your friday s test you will have to solve 3 different problems one lattice one expanded in the box and one expanded along with your division
all right today in math what we are going to do we are going to continue to talk about decimals
you boys and girls are doing a really good job doing decimals decimals today we are going to to continue to talk about putting them in order and you are going to read them like 10s and 100s and add decimal numbers order so the activities you have done before
ms c and i decided to do that today your 3 activities are something similar time if the running log what you do by yourself before so where you make an imaginary running log and what you need to do is to fill in the mileage for each day but for the total mileage for the whole week is 12.75 miles
right so you will write the date the miles and the comments ms c and i are looking for is how did you make the miles add up to 12.75 problem so that is the major major point that we are looking at is how did you come up with 12.75 do you had to be realistic about running in the miles each week when we talked about last time
thing but this time the difference is that i told you day one is 2.5 miles and day 3 is one.5 miles but the total is still 12.75 does that make sense yeah we did that last time or 12.75 right the 2nd activity is decimal compare i want you to work with a partner
compare you have a deck of cards and you see who has a greater one winner and the 3rd activity is field 2 which you also would do with a partner where you have the 10 by 10 square you see who is the 1st to fill up to 2 or closer to 2
i want to see when you are coloring those squares i want to see the decimal for each of the block that you color in sense decimal yeah you played these 2 games already and you have done something similar to this last week already
okay any questions where is the running log this is the running log yes do we do those in order yes you do them in order
next decimal compare decimal compare a and then you play with a partner whoever gets yeah and you compare who is larger and who has the larger one
b excellent you draw 4 cards and you think about what are you going to use so that you can try your best to add up to have 2 whole
no even though the running log you are doing it by yourself you can also ask your teammates to help you if you need help right and once you are done with the running log you can find a partner to help you to start the game okay you can sit somewhere that is easier for you and your partner to meet up
you only need one deck of cards for each time sorry no i think i gave you the one that is not coming back
okay think about what what is your strategy ms l what is mileage how many miles ms l is this like how do you make it to 12.75 what is the strategy to make it how do you think about the problem
nope every one of them each distant you must include 10s or 100s asked a really good question days if you look on top it says log one each distance must include tenths or 100s so the answer would have to be no to you
sorry you have to think about it
if you are running a very you can run a really long mileage for example you ran for a long time be if you start up being really tired do you think you can run that many miles
good so what were you thinking when you are doing that
you said you can not put zeros no no
0 you put 2 so you can show any 10s or 100s so if you put 9.5 tenths then 9 and 5 tenths then yes
you did show a 10th or a 100th so you walked a lot of day one okay so your comment needs to reflect why how is that you were able to walk that many miles and then how come these you only have a 10th mile 110th of a mile
okay all right that is fine then you have to think about how are you working with a decimal to reach .75 all right so you add up so you need to think about what strategy are you using
okay what do you think okay
so you have got a one and 110th one and 4 tenths 4 and 4 tenths
here that is a lot of steps all grouped into one
there i am not saying the answer is wrong and i am not saying it is right or wrong i am just asking you what is it that you are doing here i do not know you tell me you tell me
know i mean this is did you find it more efficient where you do it like this so can i ask you why you did it this way
one so did you go 5 -000 equals 5 and then 7 -one and one and one equals 4 is that what you did okay is this how you came up with 3 and 445 hundredths okay i am not saying it is a strategy
not i am just trying to make sure that you find one that you are most comfortable with and that is efficient cause when you have a number if you what we call borrowing we talk about some people call it borrow if you borrow something then this would be very confusing
remember we talked about maybe you can do it one step at a time so that way you can easily figure out if you made a mistake where you went wrong
okay all right so now that you have 3.453 and 45 hundredths miles left so what are you going to do with these 7 days left okay i will come back and we will talk about it
comments on day one you only walked one and 110th on day 2 and 3 each day you walked 4 and 110th mile comments okay honey how are you doing
now this one you can not be one because it has to have a 10s or 100s all right hun else what are you going to do hun i will be right there can you move over just a little bit so i can see a little better
thank you before you change this did you add them up to see if it is come up to 12.75 okay now that you have the change here do you have the change everywhere else at least something
yeah why is that can i come back to you in one minute i want to finish up with thanks and is next sorry you know what you can do
you can meet up with a partner and see 1st of all think about how did you come up with all those 7 days of those numbers for mileage okay
place you are right because it would be more than that do so if you through here what are you going to do to get something else sorry because i want you to think about what do these numbers represent
you how about this question how do you think about the problem what did you do strategies did you think about cause you put down here i make the 12 whole 1st so were you focusing on the whole and then figures on the 10s and 100s
strategy no i wanted to 12 wholes right here but then bottom one then you would put 75 because of this okay wrong so what you are telling me is that what i think you are telling me is that the whole numbers make 121st or no
no i mean that all these numbers make 12 okay so this 1st 6 days you wanted to make sure it adds up to 12 miles strategy i like that how are you doing this is good but i am not asking you what you ran that day because i already know that
i want you to tell me when you run one.5 miles which is one and 5 tenths mile what were you doing how come from this day to this day there is such a big change because i want you to understand those miles mean something okay
maybe you can say i ran for so long on wednesday the next 2 days i was still tired from my 1st day running sense yeah because you ran 4.2 miles on thursday and friday and saturday you only ran one one mile each day does that make sense
okay how are you doing good i remember
ms l you know you never use your mic i just do not want to scream noticing all right tell me what you did so can you tell me what were you thinking when you were doing this run
i tried to to one.75
numbers so on the decimal side you are just focusing on making it to .75 0 what do you think about his strategy
did these things called numbers not decimals add these things do how did you figure out what these things do try and make all these to 12 and then i am going to add these what are these the 10s and the ones okay
so you add the whole 1st to make 12 and then you add the 10s and 100s yeah 10s and 100s to make .75 interesting 2 +315 is this and this so this is yes 50 +20 what is that
55 hundredths not 510s interesting 123456 and then 25 hundredths makes 110th
no sometimes sometimes why is that time see you copied the wrong number this would be this one does not have to be that how did we do here okay all right so tell me what numbers what did ms
c help you with with adding up to like 12 cause what i added up is 13 cause this is ms c said you can -one so i minused okay do you understand now and then i added this all up
so do you think that is an efficient strategy for you yeah so you are constantly going back and forth to check the answer i did that i do not think it is right you do not think it is right
right let us see what we did here
okay but here it is different cause look there is so you were too much i will be right there in one minute so if you are done you can move on to the back side
okay so you did not have enough enough so you know i passed you passed you went over 12.75 back so do you think that is efficient yeah you think that is is it a good strategy where you can use it every time and it will get you where you need to be
okay i want you to think about do you think there will be another strategy that is more efficient well they are all adding good but i want you to think about is there another strategy you can use
it cause we will never know until we try right
you are my scholar of the week how are you doing so what are the strategy okay that is a strategy is that an efficient strategy yeah yeah how do you do it
too so i want you to think about are there just one strategy other strategy you before you start writing the comment can you tell me what is your strategy to figure out how do you add up to 12.75
i add the hundredths do not worry about the the one whole do you add up the whole 1st
okay and then then and the 100 okay side you know how the ones work yeah to make sure it gets to what number
12 why did you do that
because okay
so because the okay but my question to you you said to me i need to make the closest to a 12
do i are you okay i added the numbers together so i am not sure if i am getting you so you keep adding it up
i noticed you have 2.54 and one.7 and then 4.2 here and you just left it the way it was right 3.05 and and 4.55
okay so that means right yeah these 2 together and then you add them together right then what add one.25 makes 10 how did you decide that this needs to be one.35 and this needs to be one.4
because so it is 1010 plus so it is 11.35 so so did you just randomly pick these numbers right so your strategy you keep adding up until you get to 12.75
sorry where s your paper can you tell me how you checked it
1st i looked at this part and this made it to one whole so this is one whole so equals to 7 equals to 12 so i just add like 0.75 to that so it is 12.75
strategy every 2 numbers you land on one whole every 2 numbers you land on a whole every 2 numbers you are on a complete whole playing you and can play
i need you to tell me what you are thinking okay okay tell me how you came up why did you pick this number versus another number
so why did you pick one.5 2 one numbers it is easy to find okay so easy to find
so you have 7 tenths and this is how much 55 whole 5 tenths or 5 hundredths 5 whole this is 5 whole 5 can you read this to me okay can you read it in like one.50 okay
so one.5 one.50 or you can call it one and 5 tenths right when you add 7 tenths and 5 tenths together what will you have 11.5 let us look again
7 tenths give me 12nd let me grab this if you need the 10 by 10 square paper they are on my desk guys
on all right so just say this is 20 30 40 50 60 70 right so this is 7 tenths right
if i add 5 tenths 12345 this is 5 tenths it is .5 .5 is 5 tenths .7 is 7 tenths .5 is 5 tenths so all together i will have one and 2 tenths
how come because you are telling me this is all together this is 7 tenths right no i was saying 7 tenths and this is 5 tenths it is not 5 hundredths ms this if you want 5 hundredths you know what
way 12 and 75 hundredths right i just want okay one yeah okay so one okay you only want 5 tenths 5 hundredths right
so i want the 5 here zeros you can play 2 or 3 rounds of that
okay boys and girls you can play 2 or 3 round of each so you need to have 0 in order to show that is not that a big difference okay you have a one.05 or one.50 this yeah which one shows you have a one.05
is not that a huge difference okay so tell me correct me if i am wrong i think you are telling me your strategy is to add up to 121st the whole number and then the rest you just need to add up to .75
money all right what add the whole 1st and then what .75 i love that you used but then i have a question
yeah so you add the 2489 add all the things is equal to 11st so you did these 21st add them to one whole
you know that .5 and .5 makes one whole so you add 23456789101112 and then the rest you need to make to .75
good very good i am finished you do not think yeah i am taking you are taking all right are you ready
n not only do i want to see i want to see how you did it all right cool what do you call this
10s and hundredths how are you doing it is 50 that was the 50 me i got it
it but the question is how do you you guys even talk that is because we already know the answer how do you know it so quickly because there are just 10s what do you mean they are all just in the 10s place really there is no hundredths there is one i think 10
10 no this one has the hundredths this one is in the hundredths this is 90 that there is nothing greater than .95 here yeah
deck yeah so you are looking at the tenths and then look at the hundredths how are you doing good i think your partner is waiting
yeah
all yeah no we are going to talk about it in about 5 or 10 minutes are you done honey
yes i found your partner is ready let us go looks good got it
good are you done honey yeah i am with him you are with him
are you ready are you ready how are we doing
play you are missing a card you 2 can sit over there and play because it is quite crowded here
do you remember how to play yes
all right +one is 10.7
do not forget to write the decimal good job
11.9 +85 good good job
okay i need you to return the deck and go back to your seat log okay i love what i am seeing from and
job we are going to talk about it now let us go honey do not touch it please sit down please leave it alone all right ms c and i found there are quite a few different strategies that you guys used
so let us talk about them and see what you used may be a great strategy for you and maybe someone else is strategy might be just as wonderful and just as efficient so we are looking for one that is efficient so who can tell me what is your strategy
how did you figure out you want to get all the way to 12.75 of a mile yeah i made 12 wholes in the 6 days so for the 1st 6 days this is is strategy
okay can you explain to me what did you mean by the 1st 6 days you made 12 12 i made 12 and then in the last one i could okay
me so is strategy she said that for the 1st 6 days i need to make it to 12 miles because on the last day i wanted to be .75 mile right right so i guess my question to you is how do you know what did you do to make sure that your 1st 6 days equal to 12 complete miles
i put 2 numbers in the tenths place and made some number that equals to 10 to 10s to one whole
did okay she said i want to make sure that my 1st 6 days equal to 12 miles look at the numbers that she used what do you notice talk within your team
y is i am just looking at the 1st 6 days doing yeah but she said i want to make sure the 1st 6 days equal to 12 what is she doing
does that make sense to you what she said said can you look up here
a so what is whole number very good all right okay
strategy okay she used 7 tenths and 3 tenths that makes one whole 5 tenths 5 tenths make one whole 2 tenths 8 tenths make one whole the combinations of 10s
so here then she can figure out very easily how she she did not have to worry about any decimals any tenths any hundredths any of that easier so you go 123456789101112 so she had once she said had those 3 then the rest she can just make up the numbers cause she said i wanted my last one the 7th day to be .75 of a mile
think all right share do not all raise your hand at the same time now no b come on i saw the hand go up a little
saw some of you said to me when you have the days i need to make sure that on the whole side i have 12 whole and on my tenths and hundredths side i need to add up to .75 hey that was my strategy i asked you to share
share i asked anyone with their strategy to please share okay so because there is more than one person who used the same strategy some of you again add up to the whole 1st which is the ones place
then you add the tenths and then you have the hundredths so some of you said that to me what you said was i add the whole 1st some of you said one and 3 and 2 and 4 as long as they add up to 12 so 45678910 and then one and one then here that is when you said this makes it 12
now i need to make it to 7 tenths and 5 hundredths so some of you did quickly got rid of the 5 tenths 5 hundredths and then the rest you just so you do not have to worry about them at all one and that will work
yeah does that make sense everybody so that is another strategy so if you think about several of you said yeah this one works and some of you that is exactly what i used so you which strategy works best for you ms c and i saw another strategy which some of you did i am going to erase is ms
l sorry come on ms
here is that better now dd all right i saw e with a different strategy she started off with 12.75 and she kept subtracting to all the way she ended up with 0 but she made sure she had only 7 days to do that
12.75 i am going to do 2.25 she said i have this much left then she just kept subtracting til she ended up with 0 but she had to make sure that she had 7 days ee okay very good anyone else with a different strategy want to share
so i guess tomorrow we will talk about the 2nd part which is on the other side of the paper i actually gave you 2 numbers 2.5 miles one.5 miles how do you use that to help you with all of these strategies that we talked about work would all of them work with this problem or will some of them actually not work with this problem
tasks is in the hallway
everybody will need a pencil and then i will tell you which task you are doing so get your materials together
is this . no
all right of paper i know okay so we have can you pass out paper for me please start with table one
you all right . let s see and you re going to do the red task the red task over on the s not here 0 right
here . you did the red task right okay and you will do . brent s fruit shake task please begin to read at the top so that you can be sure you know what you re doing
and the rest of you if i didn t call your name raise your hand task when you are done with the purple task i have a challenge for you that goes with it and be sure that you write the everyone needs to write the problem
you need to show how you re going to solve it with math and also what math equation you re going to use and also you need to have a diagram
okay you need to show it with a picture of some kind and then i need to have a statement that answers the question question okay you know which one you re doing yes which one okay everybody has paper
yes so all of us no you re doing it by yourself i might put you in pairs but i want you to get started with reading on your own back okay you are doing the red task okay yes so do we write where the blue dot is do we write that down no
that s for after you re done solving no that s for that s for that s what you re solving yes but you need to write the question at the beginning before the recipe so the question is in the sharing and discussing part did you read the beginning yes
doing okay can you move your desk back over here
p you and can work together what you need honorable
go i put had it and i put it in there remember neatness counts girls
desks say 3 it s 2 and 3 fourths you where is your beginning
which task are you doing okay you and can work together
and since can you sit over there so that she can . so slide over and let sit here in your seat did someone borrow the eraser from table 3 it was a brand new eraser i put there yesterday 0 yeah it was just here
it it s on the ground okay yes okay do we . do we copy it down yes you do need to copy the task so you know what you re working on may i also no
her so and when you re done copying it make sure you have a conversation about how you re going to solve it okay
wait make sure you re using your best handwriting okay
miss . one that one should it be like 2 yes it s sorry
something wait water . no
2 if a bucket holds 2 and 3 fourths gallons and 43 buckets of water fill a tank 0 i thought it was 2 how much does . how much water does each tank hold
do we copy you need to copy the problem recipe did you read the beginning yes okay what is it that you have to solve for
 . there are 4 people . there s a recipe that makes enough for 4 people so you have to make it so that make enough for 28 people out which . how much of each ingredient do you need
do you write the recipe on cards for . for what amounts for the recipes for what the recipe for what the recipes for the people how many
28 yes so we don t need to take so long to copy working like . like how much . like . like . like what do you mean by like how much does each tank hold
like how much how much water 0
if a bucket holds 2 and 3 quarter gallons and . and 43 buckets hold a tank how much water does it does each tank hold
0 what is your unit of measurement multiplication no measurement all right i see some people starting to work together
no get started
paper are you going to be able to read that when you re done copying it yeah yes let me see what you have
where s your period after people we okay
okay do we have to do it all 3 ways
because it might take awhile to write 2 and 3 fourths 43 times 3 fourths 3 fourths do we have to do it that way can we just do and c like the 1st step in hard
2 and 3 fourths 43 times to go get a piece of paper
on get on task do we have to write all that not included with it so one large banana is wait you you have the sharing and discussing is after you re done with doing the 1st thing you re asked to do
do 0 figure out how much of each ingredient is needed to re write a recipe card with the needed amounts yeah how much how much of each ingredient is needed for what for brent s recipe for brent s fruit shake but for what brent s fruit shake we have a recipe for brent s fruit shake but they wanted you to figure out how much is of each ingredient is needed for what
for . read the beginning read the beginning again 4 people 28 people 28 people that recipe is for 4 people isn t it
yes read it to yourself please how much of each ingredients is needed okay
it s needed okay so what is this recipe for for the fruit for fruit shakes is wait no for
no not for 28 people needed . this recipe is for brent s fruit shake for how many people no no it says . enough for 28 people the recipe that s there already is for 28 people
out enough for 28 people okay working how are you going to make the recipe for 28 people talking after you re done copying talk about what you need to do
 . if do you have to the 2 by the 43 too out do the rest of us have partners or do we work by ourselves you re working by yourself
0 are you guys both doing the want how s it coming along
good okay tell me what you re doing i m doing the fraction yeah i said tell me what you re doing how are you solving it
what by multiplying 20 . 20 by fourths okay show me where you did 20 times 3 fourths 0 that did you do it yeah but i where s 20 times 3 fourths here
all can you please erase this and write 20 times 3 fourths and erase and then begin to solve it what instead of erasing honey it s irrelevant it s irrelevant
on task okay i m going to just draw a line here . and we re going to know that this was the wrong thing
here do we have to really do it 2 thirds remember you re you re are you asking me the same question again why because i didn t can you use the colored pencils so you would be sure we have a distinction
it means we need to change the recipe so that we can make enough for 28 people i 0 so we need to figure out the 2 of you need to be separated 0 no
okay so we re talking about 2 and 3 fourths right yes so your shape will be divided into how many equal parts okay and then how will you show 2 and 3 fourths because how you showed it before well let me say this i want you to re think how you re going to show 2 and 3 fourths because how you were just showing it before wasn t exactly correct
draw . draw me yeah keep going you re fine do . do 2 and 3 fourths let me see 2 and 3 fourths do i use a colored pencil start with drawing and let s talk about it
pencil 2 and 3 fourths you can turn off the front light honorable colored pencils okay now so this is 2 and 3 fourths what s going to happen with this one here
it s going to become next okay because when you were doing it before 0 yeah you had it empty okay and you don t want to forger about that okay okay all right would equal 3 tenths no
back 4 times 4 . come over here hold on you so tell me what here
0 i got i got 20 of divided into 4 and i was like saving them and something s wrong with your math here
20 times 3 so what are we supposed to what is it from did someone tell you 50
no where d you get 50 from i did i probably counted i probably counted it wrong okay your 3 fourths what s happening with these ones here 0 yeah they need to be shaded in i got to start over one half half just cross this out and start over on the back no i mean you re fine
also you re going to do that 3 fourths 20 times and then you re going to count how many 3 fourths you have in all okay yes thing i ever did teacher don t you do it multiply the whole number by the whole number and then the whole number by the whole number and the fraction by the fraction
there is no other fraction because is the whole number i just put it over one what nothing it s a microphone they can hear you right now 0 okay haven t we done this before yes what s your question honorable ah is this right i mean not this part but this part what did you multiply
i multiplied 43 by 2 because they re both whole numbers and then i added the fraction what happens if you just show me what happens if you do it the other way or if you do 3 times 43
right yeah so if you do 3 times 43 is 100 and over 42 and something over 4 way thank you
you re welcome can you come back over here please he . he kept saying why are you calling her name
what why are you calling s name that like how you do this and what is that nothing like this what does it mean
it means like like somebody got to do this why didn t we have a conversation about this before right before lunch today no cause he didn t we have a conversation about this right before lunch today
about you said that i had to . that i had to that i had to do my work stay on task if he s disrupting you that is not an invitation for you to disrupt
thing no i didn t you are choosing to do the wrong thing
it i did 3 . 3 fourths times 20 equals 6 fourths how does 3 fourths times 20 equal 6 fourths because i . because i did 3 times 2 equals 6 and 4 times 0 equals 4 i mean . i mean i don t understand why you did that because . because why did you this is one number right here
why did you multiply the numerator by one of the numbers and the denominator by the other because . because i thought . i thought like 36 i can t do it like what are you supposed to be multiplying 3 by honorable you by . by 20
shh i just i want you to do what we just talked about
no so we add it to 0 yeah i m coming to you in a minute yes or like put 5 all together that would be 20
for what 7 times because it says . can you please sit down and focus on what you re supposed to be doing i want to see you working you you haven t done anything yet honorable the instructions are at the top
this is our 4th or 5th time having this conversation i think we re supposed to be doing 20 boxes instead of 5 from wait
5 because i made 5 boxes and i counted them all together then there was 20 me olivia is doing her math homework for each problem she uses 3 fourths of a sheet what does she need to read the whole thing
start again olivia is doing her math homework for each problem she uses 3 fourths of a sheet of paper so she needs to complete 20 problems okay you didn t copy the problem correctly i need you go to back and start again okay read it to yourself and copy it properly please there s no way that you re going to be able to solve this and you re not you don t have all of your information
no honorable
what are you working on now writing and no you re doing something else doing writing the recipe is this yours on the floor 0 no
so i got . so i multiplied 3 by 43 and 4 by one and i got one and a 4th which equaled and 14th and then i well actually added this too
30 okay so you didn t come up with the same thing doing i think that why
i was going to make this your challenge but i think it would be easier for you to try it now to check your math remember when you are working with fractions they can also be turned into decimals
right so if a bucket holds 2 and 3 fourths gallons and 43 buckets of water fill a tank and you want to know how much does each tank hold if you re trying to multiply 2 and 3 fourths times 43 as a and 2 and 3 fourths as a fraction shh are you working on this task
take your hand off your face pick up your pencil and get busy when you re multiplying . are you going to write that horizontally or vertically vertically vertically you can t do that multiplication do your equation horizontally
yes how do you write 2 and 3 fourths as a decimal . 2 and 3 why that s 2.3 is 2 and 3 tenths can we write we did learn this
huh yeah what would be 2 and 3 fourths in money m 2 and 3 fourths would be 0
m ¢25 ¢25 is not 3 fourths what is that ¢070 ¢75 so ¢75 so how do how do you write 2 and 3 fourths as a decimal decimal 752.75 i just remembered you weren t here that day 0
30 carry your 3 and then 4 times 2 is 8 +3 is . what was it 1111 okay 118.25 or no
me i did not give permission to get up and of course getting up involved shenanigans girls good but we don t know the next step for the do we count to see how many juices there are and add them up then see how many what was the 1st thing you were supposed to do
see how many fruits there are including is that what is says yeah yes where does it say that it said on the bottom why did you do the bottom yet that s why i covered went and covered it up you guys are not paying attention to what you re being asked to do
test you re not even reading the directions at the top it because i m not done we have a recipe that makes what s happening we need to adapt the recipe i m just i m not 0 i see
you went back in so you made this 3 fourths how much of each is needed and we write the recipe and we write card 0 i forgot i need to write the amount i wrote amount 12345 i have to write this all over again 678910
11121314151617181920 all right so what are we doing with these doing with those what do we need them
them okay so you have 23 fourths yes fixed shh ah please maybe you guys should work on your own
nicely that is 3 and one he keeps writing it out and then he keeps on putting different kinds of numbers and like that s not right what s not right like he put one in front of the 7 that s the 1st one she put one in front of that 7 but it s just 7 times one yeah it s 7 times each thing
them yes no you don t have to do that and it s okay if he does that i didn t know he was numbering well you should have a conversation with him not just take over is teacher m 7 what decimal equal 7 what large bananas huh and then it would also be no i mean 7 cups right so make sure you write all of that for each one
i . i don t know how to multiply this it s not 235 horizontally it s 2 and 75 hundredths yes me what all right do your diagram and let s see what happens
you have 6 and you have 2 and 3 fourths 43 times do ah . yeah no
opened sorry room what does it have to do with you teacher j is not going to get a good report from me
good i just realize that you do have to double 43 times 2
honorable all right did you fix them can i see your math problem before you do that okay 3 no so 13rd times 7 what are you going to be multiplying
multiply . 3 fourths times 0 20 times 3 fourths yes it okay what do you need help with
do i m asked to it says try to find out how much the recipe cards be needed with the needed amounts so i need to find out what the needed that s not what it s asking you
again i need to re write the recipe card with the needed amounts
4 the recipe for the fruit shake yeah i know that but it s for how many people do if it s for 4 people and you need to make a recipe for 28 people what do you have to do to that recipe i shh ah excuse me
add it add what the fractions to add them to what to each other your going to add these fractions to each other people this recipe serves how many 4 but we need it to serve
28 so what do we have to do to the recipe in order for it to serve 28 people multiply multiply what multiply all the fruit
by by . can we put the pencil box in the middle and leave it there please by multiply all the fractions of the fruit by each other to get 28
why why would you multiply these fractions together for it to serve 28 people if that s what you think it s fine
no put that bookmark away and get get it done anymore if i have . a recipe to make one cake but i need to make 2 cakes what am i going to do to the recipe
means add i mean . doubling it means doing what to the recipe how what does doubling it mean
it multiplication okay what do i multiply each ingredient by to make it for 2 instead of one multiply each ingredient times . if it s going to be doubled what do you multiply it by
0 right so i have a recipe for a cake for one cake and i want to make 2 cakes i m going to multiply each ingredient by 2 so that it serves so that i have 2 cakes this recipe is for 4 people but i want it to serve 28 what do i have to do to each ingredient in order for it to serve 28
okay so if i double the recipe that serves 4 that would serve what is 8 is 8 so is that enough no okay so think now if this serves 4 what do i have to do to make it so that it serves 28 this is why knowing your multiplication facts is key
that s why teacher n and i talk about it with you all the time because you wouldn t have to spend the time thinking about it out ask yourself how many times this serves 4 how many times what do i need to multiply each ingredient by in order for it to serve 28
math whatever it is you need to do to figure out how many times 4 goes into 28 okay so do that and raise your hand when you re ready i m hoping that this is going to be showing me a proper diagram of your work before yeah he s been goofing around all afternoon 0
hopeful i m sorry to hear that what s 20 times 3 . where d you get 63 from this
multiply and add 3 when we multiply do we multiply and add at the same time okay do you want to take him yeah come back at 3 0 to do dismissal
that s fine clean up your area up all right we re going to be stopping soon name if you need help or have a question you just have a hand up so after we write the ingredients then the ingredients what do we do next
okay so shh for my friends that are doing the fruit shake recipe when you are done . when you are done with figuring out how much of each ingredient not everybody s listening
when you are done figuring out how much of each ingredient is needed for 28 people and re writing a new recipe for 28 people when you re done with that then you can begin to answer these 3 questions what 0 but be sure that you don t do this before you do this
okay so we write it down yes one what 77 what did you ask me
1st of all shouldn t the larger the longer number be at the . top here is this right before i color it
i did 43 except i don t know if that s the right well it s 43 times 2 and 3 fourths right 0 yeah so i have to . you re going to do the same thing did
did 43 times 3 fourths yeah is this right 0 is that was that good no ow so i need to erase this erase why because you said it s . no she only colored in 3 for 0 each 3 fourths so i have to color in every 2 and then and 3 fourths 0 okay color it except she sorry what
so i like i would color are you asking me saying i m saying i solved it the right way and i got this i got hello now do you need that statement from me
yet you okay i ll be done with this in another 3 minutes okay should i just send it down to you okay thank you okay so okay so i consider this part of the whole like so yeah i okay exactly so that s the whole part of the next whole
12 i have get on task honorable no no you haven t done anything yet
0 we . we . we change this to 7 large bananas why because . because 4 times 7 is 28 and we okay so you need to multiply each one by 7 okay all right we re getting ready to stop
finish you will have a chance to finish on monday 7 times 47 times 4 equals 28 is 28 so what do you have to do to each ingredient in order to get it so that it serves 28 people right yay all right so make a note . make a note here so that you can remember when you come back to it multiply by each multiply hey can i just bring this home with me all right 18 i see 20
8 friends we have to stop we almost done i need so i m looking to see who is ready out that s not finished honorable
i mean now we re stopping but that s not finished okay okay
sure all right let me see who s ready i don t know where she went shh
she went to go get so i m looking and i see and the rest of that table and are not ready
so let s look at the calendar 1st pull it up are you ready yesterday how much did we have and what are we multiplying by today 100 we are multiplying by 100 right so we multiply the 100 and the day
10th the 10th of the month so when we multiply 100 times 10 what would we get okay so 100 times 10 is 1000 and we add the 2
be is we added to the 4500 what would that be
on does somebody want to help him out yes pick somebody to help you out on here
5500 5500 you left off the 500 so that should be our balance 5500
so we need to add another $1000 to our money to our bank okay we re adding another $1000 to our bank and this is also going to change to 5000 yes adding another $1000 to that
what as long as you re ahead and you ve got the right answers so we have 5500 in our bank now based on this right here what do you think the next shape is going to be the next figure is going to be based on this pattern what do you think it s going to be
a pyramid she says a pyramid is everybody in agreement she thinks it s going to be a pyramid no what do you think i think it ll maybe be like i think it ll probably be a sphere or okay one or the other sphere sphere okay let s see
it s a what a pyramid who was right was right it s a sphere i mean a pyramid they may but it might be the shapes the shape there over there okay let s look at i had to put the other strip up but we re on day 77 let s look at your dmr pull it out dmr
should i hear you
i shouldn t all right let s look at this you guys may need to slip your chairs around here a little bit so you can see the folks that s at this round table right here you too
push your chair back that way and take your dmr with you so you can see what s going on you guys need to put your chairs right here
can i see yours yeah okay identify the line or identify a line so give me one line
u what s all the other stuff in between there r s t u v
okay so r s t u v cause all that runs into that line one more
x yes s and x right there that s not right that s not a line i mean p and z t is there a problem i hear talking is there a problem no i thought there was
next the next one we re going to find how many sets of 6 or how many times 6 goes into 297
okay remember what you re doing 297 and you re doing 6 and you re going to be able to work over there so what do i know that this quotient is going to be
less than what 100 why do i know it s going to be less than 100 because 6 times is 100 and 2 is higher than 297 297 so i already know it s going to be less that
so what s a good friendly number i can start at with multiplying m give her a chance to think back to learning our multiplication facts what s 6 times 9
9 do you need help do you need to find somebody to help you out here go ahead 6 times 90 is 540
540 so is that too high yes so do we need to go down to 6 times 8 or do we need to just further we need to go down further jump further yes
no we need to jump further yeah that s what i m talking about going down with numbers yeah further down so i said do we need to go down to 6 times 8 or do we need to go lower than 6 times 80
80 so what would be a good friendly number you think we can go to said so 6 times 40 is going to give us how much that would be more or less
much it would be too much so i think for the number that said here and what is this called again what is this number called is that divisor what is it called it s the quotient it s the quotient what is this right here the dividend no
the divisor divisor what is this called the dividend this is the dividend this is your quotient this is your divisor so based on that how much is 40 times 6 240 it s right over there you don t have to think about it and when i subtract it out what would i get
yes 7 take away 0 is 7 4 9 take away 4 is 5
okay so do i need to stop or do i need to continue continue continue so now this has turned into my what dividend this is my dividend now right so what s a good friendly number i can figure out how many sets of 6 i can out of 57 with what would be a friendly number where can i start it
9 so 5 times 9 is how much 54 5 times 9 is 54 45 right can i move further 5 times what
10 5 times 10 is how much 11 she says i can go 5 times 11
60 is 60 too much yes so this is the best thing right here right so i know it goes 11 times right and we already know that we re doing this one
57 so we ve got to go back and change some stuff on the side that side was 6 so let s change it 9 9 is how much 54 not too much so this is the best way here
no that s smaller than the number so what is this called now it s called the remainder it s my remainder my leftovers or my remainder i might use the leftover so then we add these 2 together so my answer is 49 remainder what 3 3 leftovers if you think about leftovers why is it called leftovers why is it called leftovers
because it has the numbers that are left out or leftover but why there s a reason why we call it leftovers go there s not enough to make another set
there s not enough to make another equal set one we said we re going to round each number to the nearest 10000 round each number to the nearest 10000 and our number is 1746394 okay i m rounding to the nearest 10000
so what number do i need to look at what place you look at the i m talking to you what place do i need to look at i m rounding to the nearest 10000 right so i need to look at that cause that s the place i m rounding to n that you need to make the 4 a 5
why because 5 and more it goes up and 4 through one goes down or stays the same pretty much right so this changes it this so once i make that 4 a 5 what happens to the rest of the digits
it turns into a 0 they turn into a 0 boys and girls that s something that you need to know they turn into a 0 the next number 3580568 is also asking us to round to the nearest 10000 h you need to look at the 0 behind the 81st i need to circle the place i m rounding to and look at the 0 behind the 8
it the 8 stays the same so tell me my number is going to be what 3000000 what 3580000 okay and the rest of these turn to zeros does everybody see that yes okay the next one it says estimate the sum or difference by rounding each number to the nearest 10000 once again so we re rounding to the nearest 10000
so our number is 99050 subtract 81703 it i always take up like this right to make it easier for me and then when i round i have everything already set up like i want it 10000 so if i round it to the nearest 10000 what number am i looking at right what number
what number do i need to look at to find out whether i need to take that 9 100000 so it s going to turn into 100000 okay based on this one what do i need to round it to i know i m rounding to 10000 but what number do i need to look at
huh what number do i need to look at one the one
to it don t round to it stays the same tell me i don t know what that means it stays the same what stays the same
8 so tell me what my rounding numbers are going to be
it so you round down to 80000 80000 see how he got that
everything turns to zeros so now we re ready to subtract that out and when we subtract that out 100000 take away 80000 is how many 1000s what s left what does your paper say
me tell me what the answer is 20000 now we need to do the exact what do i need to do i ve got some zeros playing around in here
what do i need to do to do the exact you need to subtract speak up i can t hear you honey you need to subtract that take one and that 5 becomes a 4 and the 0 becomes a 10 and then you subtract 10 and equals 7 and then when you subtract 4 from the 0 from 7
because this is actually 700 right yes right so we need to go and do some borrowing where are we going to borrow this money from or the number from to have enough up here
8000 now this turns into what huh it turns into okay so i m checking my whole 1000 over here and i m adding here this is actually 1000 now right 1000 i m taking so now i can take 700 from 1000
how much would that be j then you subtract 8000 from 1000 and you d get to 7000 correct and then you subtract 9000 from is that 9000
80000 you re actually subtracting 80000 from 90000 right i know we just said vice versa 10000 so my answer is going to be what i m talking to
17347 we said we always can check it by adding what we subtracted out which is the 81703 to see if it comes back up to that and when we do that we see that 0 we ve got a problem no we don t i m sorry 7 and 3 10 7 8 9 9
out yep that s what happens okay let s move on to our word problem it says amy earned $100 in 5 days how much did she earn in 5 days $100 $100 in 5 days she earned $100 then it says if she earned the same amount of money each day how much did she earn in one day she earned $100 in how many days
amy earned $100 in 5 days so we re looking for how much she earned each day so that s what we re looking for how much she earned each day right that s what we re looking for
correct yes so if we re looking for how much you earn day then we re going to ask ourselves is this multiplication division addition or subtraction what kind of problem is this why because you re trying to see how much you want to know ultimately how much did she earn each day right that s what you re trying to find out
so we said this is a division problem and if we said it s a division problem we set it up like this or we can set it like this or we could do it like this all that is division now we know that the quotient is going to be less than what 100 why do we know that the quotient is going to be less than 100
why why is that quotient less than 100 think about why the quotient is less than 100 what are you thinking let s talk about this and see what somebody else is thinking about why is that quotient less than 100
because it would be too high if it was 100 it would be too high because we know if took and multiplied 5 times 100 how much would that be 500 so that would be a lot more than what we re looking for so we already know so what s a friendly number we can look at based on we already know that 100 would be too much
what would be a friendly number that we can look at 20 how much is that 100 so based on this said that she earned how much a day
day that was tough right that was really simple it s not designed for it to be difficult it s designed to help you know how to take a dissect word problems and understand what it is asking you when they give you the total amount with something when they already give you they already told you she earned $100 in 5 days
so you already know that so you re not looking for the total right so that takes multiplication out of the game there and addition huh and really subtraction too i guess you could subtract and subtract and subtract it but it would be easier just to divide it amongst those 5 days right just hypothetically if she earned $20 in 5 days how much would she have earned in 7 days
how much would she have earned in 7 days think about what she earned in a day
if she earned $20 a day in 5 days she earned $100 right how much would she have earned in 7 days
okay i was going to say one.40 wow she s not making very much so in this case what are we doing
what are we doing what concept are we doing what operations are we doing we re multiplying we are multiplying now we have flip flopped it
so now we re taking multiplying 20 that she earned a day times 7 days and then we multiply that out we get $140
i don t have it have this is not yours so you need to get some scissors and cut them out real quick since yours are somewhere else once you get them come on you need to cut your out
i don t have them these are the only ones the ones i had i rubber banded them once you get them you need to sort them and figure out how many categories you have
i should see you sitting i advise you to go look for your work you and
i think you 2 can work together i don t think you need i want you to sort i want to see you sort where are they where are yours stop playing with your name and put them there i know who you are
this is a right angle here these are what s the rhombus look like it looks like okay
how many sides does it have 4 what about this wait 4 side but are they equal no
okay and what s this all equal the squares are equal sides the rectangles are i m going to go with this one too
what about this one right here that one what is over here actually only 2 sides are equal and these 2 are not so this would go here
this one is not equal at all this one is not equal at all
but you re going to need something dark like black to use
you folks that are in the back do you see what you need to do
you didn t give them to me cause i don t recall getting them well you know what it shouldn t have been on your desk
it shouldn t have been in your desk to the thing is you didn t come to me
when we finish doing our stuff can we borrow your pen and a marker and trace over our lines no no that s not even
what you have 3 right there can we use your pen and a marker to trace over our lines i don t see you doing yours okay well keep up with him i don t see you doing yours either 0 you found it
you need to have something to do because you don t have your stuff and i don t have it so you need to look through all that stuff over there on your desk and see if you can find it cause it doesn t make any sense not yet
we re going to name the categories 1st you need to go and put them where you think they go
many so ones that have right angles right they re squares but they re right angles squares have right angles and the rectangles have right angles the rectangles have right angles too
else anybody got any parallels parallel lines yes
stop go get another sheet of paper you all need to turn to 99 you should be where you have sorted turn to page 99 in your book textbook let s look at page 99
let s pause turn to 99 let s look at the top of page 99 me let s pause it says jose has a new puppy named daisy he needs to build a 4 sided dog pen in his yard for her he wants us to help him plan a pen for daisy that s what he wants to do
you should be at that page 99 that s what you should be on which of these figures could be daisy s pen let s look at the figures which of them could be her pen
a let s look at them okay which could be her pen
m which could be her pen f boys and girls all of them could be her pen all of them have sides right except for p
what p has 5 sides i just said all of them have sides right yes pen right it s a possibility all of them could be her pen but what we want to find out is the best pen for her right remember which pens would daisy probably like the most
again look at the pens 1st before your hand goes in the air look at the pens before your hand goes in the air then after we decide the pens that she d like the most then we re going to decide why she would like those pens the most but look at them 1st before your hand goes in the air
think about a puppy pen okay are we ready yes okay which ones do you think she d like the most which ones
h what else m are you saying m okay what else
c you think she would like c more okay f think about what i said different ones but the main ones she would probably like is a h i and l
l she wouldn t have a lot of space in it space it s a puppy it s trying to run around suppose you don t have a backyard then you can t let it go p p has a lot of space but look at it
no it still has a lot of space i still think the ones that have the even space around it has better space because one end of p is going to be short long right then the sides come in like this instead of like this they d be like this right instead of going like this like a square goes okay
does everybody see that look at the size this is number 3 look at the size and angles of all the figures which figures can we group together because they are alike in some way
let s group together h l and m l let s look at m so what groups would you call the sides what would you say about those sides we talked about it earlier last week it begins with a c say it
0 say it again b i and 00 okay what do you see there me what do you see there i see b
0 i m trying to figure out your relationship there what do you see over there c and f and maybe j j what kind of sides do they have they both have 4 sides yeah we know that
but what kind think about the lines we ve been talking about are they angles they come from angles i want to talk about lines what kind of lines did we talk about last week boys and girls parallel they are parallel lines right so they could be grouped tell me another group you could group together
i got something to add on to the rectangles go ahead i think a c f 0 and i and j okay we ll go with that particular parallel sides okay what about the sides it has no parallel sides which figures would that be
r no parallel sides say that again i can t hear you d what else i said e
e okay i m sorry e and j j don t have parallel sides yes it does does j have parallel sides yes say it again
k you said e and k were no parallel sides there s more than those go ahead d there s still some more left there s still some more
r e k d g yep no parallel sides what about non congruent sides they re not congruent you might start seeing a repeat of some of them but that s okay non congruent what do i mean when i say non congruent what am i talking about
they re not equal on each side they re not equal so if i put them in half they wouldn t look like one be 0 i
0 are you serious you were looking at it very wrong what s not congruent there s only a few of them up there that are not congruent k
huh only if you cut it one way way if you cut it sideways it would be congruent but we re not cutting we re saying as we see it now not with you cutting it 3 figures are non congruent what are they
3 figures are non congruent what are they you said k and g
d somebody it should be what g it should be g right yes i thought you said k and d
no i said g g k d and g okay what about perpendicular lines what did we say that is it s perpendicular sides actually perpendicular sides
tell me the figures that have perpendicular sides boys and girls if you don t know perpendicular go back flip a couple pages over it gives you the definition of what it means tell me one figure that s perpendicular has perpendicular sides i can t hear you g
one somebody tell me another figure that has perpendicular sides huh i can t hear you said e
tell me another one that has perpendicular sides k
not how many sides does a perpendicular shape have anyway how many sides does it have it has to be a what sided shape or figure it has to be a 4 sided figure 1st of all how many angles does it have
how many right angles does it have how many right angles does it have it is that the definition go back to the definition the definition says it has one right angle what does the definition say
go back to the definition what does the definition say about perpendicular lines 2 lines that are how many angles does it have 4 congruent angles how many 44
4 congruent angles that means all of them are what congruent i m not talking about congruent i m talking about them being what what am i talking about boys and girls
say we re not talking about congruent i m not talking about the angles being congruent i m talking about them being what the same shape the same shape equal right we talked about that congruent we did congruent and non congruent if something is congruent it s the same shape and size let me ask you a question just because it s the same shape does it make it congruent no
no just because it s the same shape figure does it make it congruent no shape it must be the same shape and the same what size size very very important thank you for that
sir i don t think he has any right angles who e
e we re looking at sides we said perpendicular sides okay that s what we were talking about it still should have that e which one is it
he built the one that looks like a a c e we re looking at the sides and really not the angle but i see it
way you can t understand how sometimes math is not always done the way that it seems it should be done way 2 +2 is 22 it s plain as day that this is true but teacher says she s very sure that 2 +2 adds up to
right 3 +3 makes how much 6 i do not know why must be a trick straight she keeps on saying the answer is
along i ll do it her way though she s wrong but in my heart i know what s true makes 22 all right you can see how a long time ago maybe kindergarten you said that s 22 and then when you get to be maybe 1st grade you say no if i have 2 items and i put 2 more items with it it will be
44 all right now today we re going to continue with our modeling our fractions but this time we re going to model fractions that you have with a partner beside you
moment so if we have the fraction 14th and you want to model it tell me how you could model this fraction
k you should make a square you should make a rectangle with 4 lines in it rectangle you got a marker that works well it here s my rectangle and i am going to make 4 lines no i meant 303 lines
3 no not like that no me you can help him in a minute if he can t the lines go 0 they should go in the other direction yes vertically rather than horizontal okay 234 not like that space it out what space it out how
evenly space them out evenly okay so you have to say that when you are talking about making a model of something number the denominator the denominator okay your denominator is spaced evenly good now i have 4 spaces here
denominator so what is number one over top of the 4 represent what does that represent in there what the represents that you need to shade in one of the bars okay one of the bars
model if you didn t know what this meant and you make yourself a picture then the picture shows you that i have 4 equal parts and out of the 4 equal parts that i have one is shaded in so that makes it a fraction what 14th th on the end ths
yesterday on your desk you will find a paper that i want you to work with a partner and it asks you to shade in parts of that fraction so i don t you have to look at the fraction and the bar is already made for you the circle is already made for you or whatever parts are there and you have to shade in the denominator and write that fraction question question yes sir
is that with them well you can work by yourself or you can work with a partner that s fine ready if there aren t questions solve the problems
now question yes one yes that s the one the 1st one says to do what
shade in 2 parts okay 2 equal parts okay it says shade in 2 equal parts so does that mean you have to shade in the entire part
problems 1st problem number one and number 2 please number 2 shade 3 fourths of that one
board how many parts do you have a class read number altogether for me please
shade 2 equal parts write the fraction for the shaded part so she has a picture of how many parts 33 parts and she shaded 2 out of the 3 and the fraction is what
begin shade 4 equal parts write the fraction for the shaded part 4 equal parts and you gave how many parts did you have altogether 6 teacher 6 parts divided equally and you shaded how many same how many parts if you simplified it
it would be 2 thirds all right so 4 sixths is the same as 2 thirds agree okay now to wrap this up because this is a very short lesson
time today we re starting off our lesson with our timed math assessment for multiplication
i hope you ve been practicing your math facts your turn around facts because tomorrow we re doing our division these are the samples that go in your portfolio inside of our file cabinet as well as your binder today remember you have 40 minutes because you have 80 minutes each problem you should have 30 seconds to do
remember the skills i gave you at the beginning of the year the little tricks to help you move faster anything that is multiplied by 0 is 0 anything multiplied by one is the same number anything multiplied by 10 is that number with a what in back of it 0 anything multiplied by 11 is just a number that the number itself is doubled
anything multiplied by 2 is double the number
down can i have please walk around and collect and can i have please turn off the lights for us
overhead excuse me could you sit up and push in your chair a little r maybe that will help sorry baby
help can i have everybody that s over there let me know can they see enough switch desks
you re going to have to turn the other way please thank you so much
huh little bit better we re all on the screen review in fact we re going to start off with 2 reviews and then jump ahead inside of our journals because we re a couple lessons behind and we really just need a little more practice at this point using the chart and interpreting the data
let s begin with the story that we did for tara and nate which was on page one that you guys did for homework again nate tara was 80 cm at birth
then we had nate who was 85 cm at birth which would be 2 years we started off with 2 years of age now when we started with tara tara had a steady growth rate and we said let s count by 5s
she had a steady growth we said that steady mark would be jumping by 5s but for nate he was 85 cm at 2 years of age 4 we said let s jump by 10 or 15
somebody said from 15 let s jump from 85 to so for him we said that would be at 100 and so at the age of 3 we jumped instead of 5 we jumped 10 which would give us 95
age of 4 he jumped 15 maybe or 20 so he was 115 cm so then he had a slower growth and we said let s go back to our 5s 120 at 6 we gave him 125
130 at 8 135 at 9 he was at 140 and at 10 he was 145 jump then he had a great jump
then the steepness of the line the rate of change was really fast and then he slowed down to a regular rate of change just like tara
i said that everybody s nate would be different but we all decided to have tara at the same rate of change remember
that was our homework and that was a little bit of review because was not here when we did that homework our next review we talked about tony maya and susie yesterday correct and that was on page is that one of the ones i had you take home or no
books everybody should be at page 5 to help with this review this time we have red green and blue tony tony was 85 cm tall on his 2nd birthday
green for maya she was 90 cm tall on her 2nd birthday she s going to be our blue and then of course lastly we had susie and susie was the short one she started out at 80 cm on her 2nd birthday
so can anybody read to me what tony did k tony was 85 cm tall on his 2nd birthday he grew at a steady rate until he was 10 years old on his 10th birthday he was 135 cm tall so let s go 10 for tony
cm i m sorry tony was green 85 so he was at 135 on his 10th birthday and tony did a steady rate of growth
135 so if i come down want to jump by 10s 95 95 to 105 105 to 115 115 to 125
okay so let s say he had a steady rate work we have to come down
see so we re not going to use excuse me we re not going to use those 21 we jump by 10 another 10 then a steady 5
i think that s the best way to go
no i think the bottom line is going to be about a rate of change for us the bottom line
now that was our trial one now would somebody like to read to us maya s story
go ahead then she grew very slowly until she was 10 years old cm so for maya maya was 90 cm tall on her 2nd birthday and she grew very quickly until she was 7
by her 10th birthday she was at 145 cm so she grew quickly until she was 7 at 7 let s jump up and see where we can be at 7 you have 2 years in between
let s do almost like a 2.5 jump but so she s over here for 9 and for 8 let s have her here
at 7 let s put her at 135 jump let s say 105
another yeah okay
okay she did 5 10 15 then she did a 5 10 then she did almost a 12 i m sorry 5 6 7 8 jump here 8 cm here
jump so did she do she did great big jumps then she did a slow speed in her jump directions can i have somebody give us susie s story
cm on her 8th birthday she was 115 cm tall and between 6 and 8 she grew more quickly at 9 there was a slow
right between 2 and 6 she grew at a steady rate
5 so 85 then we ll get to 90 and then we ll hit 95 and then we ll hit at 6 we ll hit 100 now she grew more quickly so we need to go straight up
for 7 she grew 8 cm and for 8 she grew 8 cm then she stopped
she did 2 here 2 here here she did 8 here she did 8 here she just did 5s story yes would everybody s be the same
no on all 3 of these everybody is going to be different now i kept a copy so let s start with susie
she was an 80 85 90 95 and then she was 100 at 100 she jumped to at 6 at 100 she jumped up to 108
she did the same cm jump at 8 then she did a steady 2 okay then for our next person which was who
maya maya is a blue she was at 90 and we had her jump 15 cm to 105 and then we had her jump 10 cm to 115
8 so she was at 124 3 or 4 then same thing again 130 that was a nice 8 jump
then she did a 5 jump to 35 and then she did 2 jumps 2 cm jumps until she hit 145 so she did a steady increase and then our last person was who
tony tony started out at 85 and then he did 5 cm jumps no 10 cm jump 95 then he did 95 to 100
from 100 to 105 105 to 110 to 115 until he hits he s supposed to hit 135 at 10
now today i thought we would do a jump because all of these seem to be the same and i wanted to do the growth of the trifoot and the fastwalker
today we re starting off with just one of the people that are going to be on our grids for the growth of the trifoot they re going to give us the information we need you re going to work on the growth of the fastwalker by yourself
that let s use my black pen to go over this on your grid right now using a regular pencil for the trifoot put a dot at 15 17 put a dot at 19
21 put a dot at 23 25 put a dot at 26 27 put a dot at excuse me guys
put a dot at 29 then one at 31 and one at 33 and the last dot is at 35 each dot is at a year of birth so you have a steady growth do not connect your dots as of yet
i m going to walk around and give everybody a colored pencil so that you have a different pencil to use when we go to put the fastwalker down i m going to call people up to put the fastwalker up here i m going to leave this up for the moment but everybody should be on page 18
t page 18 read the directions the fastwalker grows by a special rate
it is see whether you can figure out the pattern for the rest of the table for the fastwalker s growth let s start
at 0 age of birth it was one cm tall at one year of birth it was 2 cm tall 7 at 4 it was 11 16 can anybody tell me the rate of change
change has anybody figured out the pattern change anybody the rate of change i ll give everybody a minute
you re looking for the rate of change set that down you re looking for the rate of change
change anybody want to take a guess 5s no it might go by the change of 5 once but does it do it more than once
say that louder because i think you re right it skips by one then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5
push in your chair take your math book and please go to ms
room please take your math book please take your pencil and please go to ms
room i apologize for the rudeness of your classmates
1st there was a change of one then a change of 2 then the next change was of 3 and the next change was of 4 and from 4 it went to 5 6 so from 16 we went to 22 what s the next rate of change going to be
29 no what is the rate of change 7 if we add 7 to s answer then what s our answer going to be 29 what s the next rate of change
8 and if we added to s number that would be 37 r we went from 8 to what s the next number after 8 45 what s the next rate of change
9 if we add 9 to s answer what is it m from 9 to 10 so the next answer would be from 45 to 55
46 you thought it was 46 overhead we went from a rate of change where did we have the confusion at
8 so if we add 8 to what number 37 15 45 8 was the rate of change 8 we went from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8
9 54 is our answer and the next rate of change is 10 which would be 60 what 64 so that was the last rate of change change we re going up by ones
that s the actual rate of change and the answer to it is what the steepness of the slope is going to represent okay set who s going to come up and start helping us put it on our chart
anybody let s start at 0 age of birth up nobody me let s clean off our overhead i have to call people
chart you re going to pass off to ahead 0 age of birth right there at that line and it s at one you at one year of birth it s 2
so yours is going to be a little bit higher than s his should have been down a little good let s jump to the next table
for age 2 it s going to be 4 cm so it s right below the line going for that table come over
is doing age 3 at 7 that s 5 below 5 7 is above 5 good can i have come up
she is going to give us the rate of change for age 4 11 11 is right above 10 right above it mark can i have age 5
16 wrong line going can i have come up please show us age 6
hurry age 6 age 6 is what rate 22 right around there right above right there up age 7 have the answer before you come
age 7 what s out answer for age 7 29 come on you re going to do i m sorry
you re at age 7 29 would be for age 7 29 okay intersecting let s do a circle because they re meeting at that point j what is it going to be for age 8 give him the answer
37 so find 37 for age 8 37 would be right in there age 9 for come on up age 9 is what
45 age 10 let s come back to 99 is right on the line right there
10 age 10 is what answer it was 55 55 okay so we had a significant rate of change
so where do they intersect 29 is it 29 or 27
29 so i m going backwards but we had a significant steep jump slow rate of change large rate of change a steady large rate of change and then a very steady rate of change
we were all over the place instead of a steady rate like we had with the trifoot this one was all over the place on our map okay so now what i m going to ask you to do with your partners at your table for right now and we ll have work with and and we ll have sit at s desk
that way your back is to the your back is going to be to the you re going to sit in s chair together everybody should have completed page 19 i ll leave it up for a few more minutes before i turn the lights back on
20 we re going to be pulling these 3 pages out this was a short assessment you re going to work with your group to respond to what do you think is the rule for the fastwalker s growth
write as clearly as possible so the scientists on rhomaar can understand exactly what you mean change the rate of change was by what number there was a constant change and the constant change was always by adding one to the number the 1st rate of change was one
2 the 2nd rate of change was 4 5 you re always adding the number what to the number before if you just keep adding one to the number one you re always going to get the answer of you have to use all of your language all of your vocabulary to respond
for number 2 and 3 work with your team together to have exact responses come on over please keep your back too
ahead thank you
make sure your grid is filled out before i get these responses
funny you need to pull out pages 18 and 19 please put your name and today s date on all 3 papers up that is going to be collected and stapled in one moment and for homework please pull out page 21 and 22
21 and 22 is your homework you can put your math books away if you re sitting at your desk
up we just did this all together name and date should be on all your pages already as soon as you opened up your math book
thank you for those people who are already organized and are ready for me to staple
easier put your homework away thank you
me why does your your pages are thicker than everybody else s thank you
please you can put your homework away i ll wait thank you i ll wait
i didn t page 18 is the only page i m looking at then page 19 then page 20 page one of this work i m collecting is page 18
that the assessment is page 18 19 and 22 people have corrected me so i m correcting everyone so we can stop with the confusion okay we are responding because we did the work on page 18 together we just did the work on page 19 together
your group right now should be discussing the answers to 12 and 3 and i believe we just discussed together number one there is a constant rate of change and it s always by one
one is being added to the number before the number before if the number before is 5 adding to it makes it 6 if the number before is 9 and i m adding one the rate of change is now 10 there is a constant change to the rate of change by adding one
3 different ways i just said to you what you can write down as your open response to question one colored pencils are on the floor and you need them
up i m collecting these in exactly 2 minutes but i m turning off the video recording now because our math block is over we need to get to reading
today last week we did a lot of work with our open boxes dimensions can somebody refresh my memory and tell me what the dimensions are it okay
week dimensions are what you multiply to get the volume okay good dimensions numbers you multiply to get the looking at this box how can i use this box to tell what the dimensions are
t so the dimensions are the numbers that represent the length the width and the height okay last week we worked on boxes like this that had no tops and we were working with cubic inches and we had different packages that were different sizes and shapes and we were not only finding the volume with given dimensions
we also had different size packages that we were trying to see how many packages fit okay and today we are going to do something a little bit different not only are we going to be making our own box but we are going to be using different cubes we are going to be using these cubes here and these are cubic centimeters okay
so they are smaller and they are going to be a different way of measuring things i are they the same thing as they connect together they do not connect here these are centimeters where these are cubic inches i was just asking if they connect no they do not connect so these you just all 4 sides are flat okay
so the challenge today is our box is going to have a top on it and you are only given a small amount of these cubic centimeters envelopes so the challenge today is when we build our box we are going to have to find different measuring strategies to find the dimensions and the volume
so we need to find the volume of our box and we need to find the dimensions okay
so again once we build our boxes i will refresh your memory on what we need to do but the 1st thing we are going to do is we are going to build a box i can i go to the bathroom please hurry up please so i am going to demonstrate everyone is going to get a pattern and if you notice we do not have the cubes measured out for us
box that is going to be part of our responsibility today carefully everyone is going to get their own then i will go around and put a piece of tape at everyone is desk and you are going to rip small pieces to tape it up but we are going to create a closed box so when you get your pattern you see that the outer edges are on a dotted line
around so now everyone is paying attention because i am only doing this once and if you build your box wrong then the whole activity is going to be wrong 1st i am going to cut out along the dotted line it already gives you the pattern it already gives you the pattern
so now we are going to like we have done before in the previous weeks when we made our own boxes we are going to fold up the sides here because usually when we did this before it would just look like this j so it can go over the top for the top very good
so you are just going to fold all the sides okay and then i do not need to spend time taping my box but i will give everybody a piece of tape so you can carefully tape the sides
then that way you come up and you have your closed box figure okay again now that you see that we have a closed figure last week we had an open box and we were packaging our little packages and we were figuring out how many would fit
today the challenge is to take your closed box take your envelope of cubic centimeters and you are going to have to find a measuring strategy using those cubic centimeters to find the dimensions and to find the volume so remember the dimensions are the length width and height
i would not it be the same thing if we did it with the open box but that is what we are going to find out we are going to find that out today but remember you do not have an unlimited supply last week when we were working with our connect cubes our cubic inches we had a whole bunch and we could build if we needed to take 40 to fill the box we could get 40 to fill the box
today you only have the amount that are in your envelopes questions i have a question yes can we put the cubes in before we i am going to tell you right now no you are not even going to get your cubes until the box is built taped and closed okay
so what i am going to do is i am going to have and quietly please pass one of these out to everyone please then i am going to have i might only have one for each table it looks like and already have some so just give one for each table
while you are doing this and you are in the cutting stages i am going to come around with a piece of tape and i am going to put a piece on everyone is edge of their table so you might have to share scissors then when you are done and you have built your box you need to show it to myself or ms c before you can come up to get your cubes
we need to check to make sure your box is built correctly before we will give you envelopes with your cubes questions if you finish there are pages on the board
everybody that means i can not cut anything then share with that so i am giving you one big piece of tape
yourself i want you to build your own boxes then you can talk about your own strategies calm down
just stick it on the side of your desk all right come on here we do not have time
going building the box is not the important part so we need to get through that very quickly
i am coming there is 3 microphones around yes yeah you can fold it 1st because it helps to make them have your math notebooks out because this is not on a workbook page
i don t think your eye is let me take that for you while you start to is it all taped up
up all right instead of talking how about we finish up our box
you guys are going to do it together
started help who finish taping up fancy okay so we are trying to figure out the dimensions and i thought that if well why do not you see
drawing i was going to draw it up like that so you are going to use one cube then draw all of the other cubes on there no i wish i could have did this when it was flat can i squish my box a little so what are you doing
i am doing this but it does not seem to work because they are kind of coming off but if it does not matter it is 5 5 5 these are those are cubic centimeters so 5 represents what 5 represents this is just like 2 cubes right what do you mean
like 2 regular cubes do not even worry about the cubes that we were working with last week equal the 5 equals what is it called an inch i do not know what is the task that you are trying to do i am trying to find the dimensions okay
so if you are trying to find the dimensions what did you already find all right so you are on a good start
yeah do not be losing these because i do not have too many
we found the length was 7 so how many cubes 7 80 yeah and then you also found the width right what does the width look like right okay
start hurry up ready so now do not forget you are trying to find the dimensions then find the volume okay
doing where is a piece of paper qualifying writing it on the desk is not an okay way to show me the answer reason i want to see you use the cubes to show me and get out a piece of paper
do it again because i am not taking a bunch of scribbling on the desk tape does anyone have an extra piece of tape you the box needs to be closed off
up what about this side and this side that is fine good so now you can use your cubes to find the 3 dimensions which are what again j length width and height okay good
so now you are going to use your centimeter cubes to find the length the width and the height here so you are using the perimeter to find okay good
good very good all right so now i want you to formulate your strategy in your head because i might as you to come up and share your box okay all right so let us see
dimensions i have got 8 right here good so put the 8 cubes that you found as the length good job then i added 3 more to the top 1st show me how you found the length before you move on before you find the width so put the cubes up there and show me
i need the voice levels to come down to a 2 good i added good and by adding those 3 cubes you found what dimension
4 times 8 is the width no not the width the width is how wide it is width how wide it is remember
remember the width 8
it that is what i am saying now we have to figure that out
good so what are the dimensions for this box tall how many cubic centimeters wide 5 and how many cubic centimeters long
8 so now your next step is to find the volume volume how many how many would fit in this box but it is closed off so we can not put these cubes in this box like we could before
find i put the cubes on top of each what is the formula that we learned a couple weeks ago to find the volume
i forgot so if you forgot how can we figure it out since this box is closed and you can not put the cubes inside i want you to think about it for a minute and i am going to come back and check in with you and see if you figured it out
time out it is way too loud in here you are at like a level 8 when you know group work is no higher than a level 2 yes these 2 are go ahead wait a 2nd
so if this was an open box we would have to find how many would fill it up right but it is a closed box so if it is a closed box and you found the dimensions how can you find the dimensions to find the volume
it what is the formula for volume though that we learned how can you figure out how to fill this up without opening it up
what let me see how much it is yes we are done you are all done here
pages i am going to have a couple students share but you can work on that for a few minutes gross what is there to do when you are done yes
done yeah i add the dimensions 5 8 wait length was 5 width was 8 and the height was 3
sure it is 4
volume the volume is like right you do not have enough cubes
this area right here is really going to be i am talking about how loud you are and i might have to make some adjustments for the next time
volume times width why do not you write it down so you are not stuck in your head so to find the bottom floor we could find the what at the bottom floor just looking at this bottom floor here we can find the what area area and to find the area we can do what
the dimensions find the stuff to find the area the length times the what
what that is the same thing what you just told me what the formula for volume is
so now now that you know the formula and you know the dimensions you can find the volume does that mean i am done take a seat please we are going to move on i am going to have 14 what dimension is 14
show me how many cubes it takes to make up the length show me there are workbook pages up here so there is no reason to be having these personal conversations
b all right back go back to that back desk because i said so so go so what is the width i got 4 that time let us see
out is that the width that is the height so now let us find out how wide it is
back you can be doing this as well not staring in to space on let us go
so show me the edge that we could use to measure the width show me one of the edges that we can use to measure the width that is the height which one well that is the edge that we use to find the height now which edge can we use to find the width show it to me
0 the side there you go i already tried that one up here pages okay good very good there is 5 dimensions what is the formula for volume
5 times 8 times 3 not 3 volume yes
you i forgot the definition so you have found what 2 dimensions so far what height and what else times one
no that is the width so how many cubic centimeters wide is it 5 okay so now we are missing the what so how can we find the length all you need to do is 4 times 5
height you need to find the length so what strategy did you use to find the width and the height can you use it to find the length show me how to do the length on this box that is the width show me the length this is the width how wide it is is the width
5 this is the width this is the height now show me where the length is right here from here to here would be another what
length what did you just do with your finger is an edge is 2
height now which one is the length this look at this box it if i gave you i would measure how long is this box
this so if this is the bottom floor and this is the top floor going from here to here is the what length no the height going from here back is what is the length would be right here somewhere that is still going back
width how long is it 5 5 is the width 4 is the height now show me what edge run your finger along the edge that will show me the length i just did it for here
height this is an edge for the width now show me an edge for the length length we have got to share now what is the width how wide it is how deep how far back does this box go all right we have got to do this really quick
as i was walking around the room a lot of us had a lot of good ideas on how to find the dimensions but once we got to the volume a lot of us were stuck up they did a great job finding the dimensions and finding the volume so if you could bring your cubes and maybe you can use this as a little platform everybody is paying attention and show us what you did
what me and did was we put the cubes on the sides put your box up here so that everyone can see platform and
attention we put cubes on the side then we found the length was 8 and the width was 5 then the height was 4
what we did was we after we did that we did 5 times 8 then we got 40 then we times it by 4 then we knew that it was 160 then said that it is the volume let me see this for 12nd here
if you look on the box they found the edge across here and they measured it with their cubic centimeters and it took 8 of them to go from here to here then they identified the width how wide it is how far back does the box go thing how many cubic centimeters does it take to fill from here to here
they found out that it was 5 then the height how many stories it is how tall is it they did the same thing they built it all the way up and they found that it took 4 cubic centimeters now what is the formula now that we have our dimensions
the length is 8 the width is 5 and the height is 4 cubic centimeters volume can somebody tell me or tell me what you did volume the volume 5 times 8 times 4
so the volume equals length times width times height and all you have to do is once you have found the dimensions you plug them in so it is 8 times 5 times 4 which equals what 40 and 40 times 4 is what
160 now really important use cubic cubic what though cubic centimeters centimeters there is a lot of different cubic measurements we were using cubic inches last week so there is cubic meters
centimeters oops so you have to make sure that you are labeling it or it is what wrong okay so good job today now i need everyone to pay attention for the clean up instructions
out make sure you have your math morning work with your notebook away i ll give you until the count of 0
3 2 one one half
that 0 work this morning you did not have to do number one can anyone by show of hand tell me why i asked you not to answer number one d the answer s not up the answer s not up there that is why okay
2800 very good 2 number 2 says roger bought 34 jigsaw puzzles pieces how many puzzle pieces did roger get in all 1st i need to understand what it is that i m answering
remember a couple of weeks ago we talked about taking a question changing it into a statement so the question is how many puzzle pieces did roger get in all
think how many pieces puzzle pieces did roger get in all
j roger had blank puzzle pieces very good you want to do that so we know exactly what it is we re looking for
we know we re looking for the number of what anyone puzzle pieces he had in all that helps me to figure out what i need to do what operation i need to do to solve this problem problem one way could be by anyone multiplication
addition which way would 4th grades have to solve or i would prefer multiplication what 2 numbers are we multiplication 34 times 99 if you did not do that honestly did not do that do not raise your hand but i will give you a minute to solve the problem
if you finished solving the problem solve the problem in an additional way a different way
now your time begins now if you need help from a neighbor you have permission to do that if you need help from a neighbor
i m going to be calling on you
chair you should have 2 ways of solving the problem using multiplication there you have to solve it a 2nd way
you probably want to spread those 2 numbers out and we didn t quite write it like that i think i know what you re thinking about not quite
okay can i see your hand if you would like an additional minute
by show of hands how many of you solved the problem by using the shortcut method this is the shortcut method what i have written up here is the shortcut 36 9 times 3 is 27 +3 more is 30
you have to hold our place value here for the ones because we multiplied by 10s 9 times 4 is 36 9 times 3 is 27 +3 more is 30 6 3 +0 is 3 and 0 +3 is 3
can i see your hand if you used the lattice method that seems to be the popular method in this classroom if you used the lattice method this is our lattice it not a good way to do that
okay so we have 34 times 99 3 times 9 is 27 3 times 9 is 27 3 times 9 is 27 okay 36 another 4 times 9 is 36
now i am ready to make my rectangles you go with him her you are the special one all by yourself so i have 6 +0 is 6
7 +3 is 10 16 remember to put that one in the next rectangle one +2 is 3 13 put that one up here
answer yes that s my ugly owl
t i used this way okay see you have 30 +4 and 90 +9
30 +4 t can you tell me what goes into this 1st box 90 times 30 that equals you didn t put your answer but you know that 90 times 30 goes here
box say it again look at it carefully look here we have 30 and we have 9 go tell me what goes into this box
all right and the final box good job and now we just need to work on the multiplication facts are you ready to give me the number that goes into this box 90 times 30
270 4 times 90 360 my gosh that s my 6 now add it all up yes add them all together
girl if you get your multiplication facts you will be unstoppable because you know what goes where you ve just got to put all of those pieces together 260 270 and 36 and i add these guys together 0 +0 +0 +6 equals 6
0 +6 +7 +3 equals 16 13 one +7 8 +3 11 +2 13 one +2 3 so now i need to go back and look at what i was asked to do
all how many puzzle pieces does roger have in all 3366 very good similar you have 3 different ways 3 different methods
on questions about number 2 question unclear okay let s move onto number 3 number 3 says what is the missing number in this sequence 4 16 64 blank 1024 1096
so if i have 4 and i move to 16 what has my number done j by 4 so you re saying 4 times 4 equals 16
rule my next number is 64 that means i have to take 16 times 4 to see if it equals 64 16 times 4 4 times 6 equals 24 4 times one equals 4 +2 equals 6
right so now we re saying we need to take 64 times what everyone anyone right let s check and see what we ve got 64 times 4
notebook i m going to be calling on you
you skipped number 3 i know i don t know what it is about number 3 i keep skipping too once you have your answer give me a thumbs up go 4 times 4 is 16
4 times 6 is 24 +one is 25 let s just check just to make sure because our next number we have 1024 so we re going to need to take the number what 256 and do what
seconds did you do it
here tick tock goes the clock 15 seconds are you drawing over here instead of working like i asked you it here we go 4 times 6 is 24
22 4 times 2 is 8 +2 is 10
paper yes so we must know that our rule is times 4 back 0 question about number 4 this is actually number 4 i skipped number 3 not intentionally let s go back to number 3 how has this figure been transformed
a okay what did the figure do it has been slid or it has moved to the right and down
right maybe that s why i skipped it because it was such an easy answer which symbol goes in the box to make 0 yes one of my favorites
40 +5 equals the same as 9 something 5
that could be add subtract multiply divide 40 +5 equals what 45 45 so in order for our answer to equal 45 on this side i have to take 9 blank 5
45 so in the box you should have an x good all right
give yourself if you got 2 if you got 3 of those correct give yourself an inside cheer as you take out your math book you re going to do question number 2 all week long ms
j don t try to get to school late to try to miss it either please have your math book out in fact you re probably going to i think it is volume 2
this week today actually we are looking at simplifying fractions
notebook that s why i didn t say to take it out because you already had it out right okay
book i need for your eyes to go up on the screen and for you to participate j yes thank you all right
okay equivalent fractions are 2 fractions that represent the same parts of a whole pencils i should only see those eyes looking at me not at the table not at the book not around the room but at mister j equivalent fractions are fractions that represent the same 2 parts of a whole
for example 2 over 4 is equal to think fraction okay
2 over 4 equals one half suppose i had this box and i split it into 4 equal pieces of course it s not going to be exactly right because i m drawing it freehanded
you get a pizza cut it into 4 pieces we have to share 2 of those pieces how many pieces are left again we get a pizza get my pizza out here
you get a pizza okay we cut it into that s not going to work for me
stay i ve got a circle cut it into 4 pieces shade those pieces in half of my pizza is left
louis that s how we pronounce his name louis works summers at maria s fruit farm one day maria agreed to give louis extra pay if he could sell 2 thirds of her supply of peaches they started with 15 bags of peaches and louis sold 10 of them
so louis said to maria 10 bags is 10 fifteenths of the 15 bags you wanted to sell
drawing look at the drawing under the writing do you think louis is correct
yes because what louis did was took 10 fifteenths and broke it apart into 2 equal pieces think back to last week
week we took a fraction and we broke it into equal pieces so our numerator has to 5 because 5 +5 equals 10
parts can it be that
equal i know what you mean but i want you to say what you mean equal i can t hear you at all
tell me what you re thinking
i know you can speak louder tell me what you re thinking say it out loud
what s different about this number sentence and this number sentence they have to be what equal they have to be equal okay is 3 fifteenths the same as 7 fifteenths yes no anyone
no so it s got to be equal got to have equal parts questions unclear not certain unsure
answer all right
seconds i need a volunteer to explain what my final answer would be answer equal parts
i couldn t hear you
fraction okay go i know you re a little nervous
one let s suppose we had 8 and 8 tenths want to try it
4 tenths good maybe we should have a few practice problems like this
right look at the picture notice how it has 5 fifteenths +5 fifteenths and then under it it has 13rd +13rd well when you look at the strip the top strip is broken into 15 pieces
pieces so if 10 of those 15 strips are covered then how many thirds are covered 2 so is it fair to say that 10 over 15 is equal to 2 over 3
is do we all agree
it if i say to you take 10 fifteenths and prove that it is equal to 2 thirds would you be able to prove it
okay yes no if you would like to learn how to do it without using the fraction circles or the fraction strips let me see your hand honestly it s a 5th grade thing hands down
now almost everyone said they want to learn how to do it without using the fraction strips and the fraction circles which is excellent because when it s test time you know you won t be able to use those things the only things you will be allowed to use is a piece of paper and a pencil now it s going to get to a point where you re going to be on a computer so you just have to use a scratch paper and a pencil
today i would like you to have your notebook open to a blank page so we can learn how to simplify
know you do do we re going to look at the top number and the bottom number and write the multiples of each
scratch and my favorite says what kind of chart
in i need for you to turn to someone at your table and you re going to have 30 seconds to tell your neighbor about your weekend so that you can wake up you have 30 seconds think about it
seconds we had a long weekend 3 day weekend and you 2 are going to need to exchange information say whoever is the shortest will go 1st
30 seconds then we re going to switch starting when the hand reaches the 12 now
if you re speaking you have 15 more seconds what are you 2 doing you re frenemies now you went shopping and didn t buy me anything time s up
the 1st one was doing the morning work and now it s just talking up please have a seat math maybe i have a little more participation this time okay your eyes should be on the screen
we re going to simplify 10 fifteenths 1st we start off with our t chart i need to find the factors of my numerator and the factors of my denominator backwards i m going to simplify so i m not going to use my t chart
when i simplify i m breaking it into smaller pieces so in order to break it into smaller pieces what operation do i need to do
divide add i want to make it smaller i m talking about fractions subtract almost divide divide i want to divide okay
what number can be divided into both 10 and 15 without a remainder know what number can be divided into 10 and 15 without a remainder
5 so you re saying if i have 10 and i have 5 i won t get a remainder if we start with 10 and put it into groups of 5 will you have a remainder 2 if you start with 15 and put it into groups of 5 will you have a remainder no how many groups will you have
3 so what i can do now is take my quotient because i divided by or used the number 10 divide by 5 on the top and the bottom actually i m dividing by what s 5 over 5
one whole one whole but i have that special one whole 5 divided by 5 is 2 15 divided by 5 is 3
right you should have it copied once you have it copied you should be onto the next page i want to see the next page in the next 5 seconds because it doesn t take a lot to copy that you haven t finished copying what do you need to do when you finish copying turn to the next page you didn t turn to the next page
book the next page in your book not your notebook okay vocabulary equivalent fractions simplify simplest form vocabulary equivalent fractions simplify simplest form
2 fractions that represent the same part of the whole are equivalent fractions the fractions 10 fifteenths and 2 thirds are equal or equivalent simplifying a fraction means finding an equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator and denominator i want you to copy that sentence into your notebook
simplifying a fraction means finding an equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator and denominator i will give you 93 seconds
okay i think perhaps you and i need to stay after school today that means you ll be staying after school today or tomorrow decision you need to get on track with us during regular school hours or after school
decision 30 seconds you forgot something you forgot your period but you put it there
pokies read question number 3 to yourselves silently as i read it aloud maria had 12 boxes of apricots she sold 10 of the boxes write the fraction of the boxes sold
fraction maria had 12 boxes of apricots she sold 10 of the boxes how do i write that as a fraction
good use your notes to simplify 10 twelfths you may work together in teams 10 twelfths i want to simplify
remember when we simplify we want a different denominator and a different numerator and it s going to be bigger or smaller
okay let s see what we have what are we going to divide our top number by anyone
5 so that means we have to divide our bottom number by the 5 as well because remember whatever you divide by on the top you have to divide by on the bottom because we are dividing by one see 10 divided by 5 do we get a remainder if we do that yes or no
no 12 divided by 5 do we get a remainder if we do that 5 we have to come up with a different number remember whatever number is on the top has got to be the same number on the bottom because we are dividing by one
please work together in groups like i asked now is the time to share your information up thank you
you re thinking too far in advance
10 divided by 6 remainder 10 then put them into groups of 6 leftover can you use that number
okay you re adding
ahead you re finished i don t see any work i see a picture drawn though okie dokie little pokies one let s see if i divide by one on the top and the bottom 10 divided by one is what
10 12 divided by one is 12 no remember when we simplify we want to change our numerator and our denominator
secret you probably never ever use the number one when you re simplifying 2 divided by 2
if i use 2 on the top will i have a remainder 10 divided by 2 will i have a remainder no okay my scratch i have 10 put them into groups of 2 make a mental picture how many total groups do i have
5 so i m going to put that guy over here i have 12 put them into groups of 2 make a mental picture
6 is my numerator for my final answer the same as my initial
yes yes you have so when you simplify you are going to use what operation division we re chopping it up into smaller pieces it has the same value but we re chopping it up into smaller pieces
i know i promise you once you get this fractions will become a whole lot easier for you not only this year but last year and the year after that and when you get to algebra and pre algebra
easier so you re going to have practice tonight home i want you to solve question number 4 5 and question number 6 from your textbook on that page
that is your math homework for tonight now your think question to wrap this up what did you learn that was new today think as you re thinking you may put your materials away
today think i know you have your answer whenever your materials has been put away girl has his answer has his answer i m going to call on you
has his answer everyone at this table almost has his answer i ll just choose 4 people randomly something new today you learned in math
how you can equal fractions in a short way
new simplifying fractions okay let s have you re running out of time
today i m sorry and all right your homework for tonight page 372 numbers what 4 5 6
correct yeah anyone not have the addition subtraction today please raise your hand cause you were absent excuse i could not find it in our folder i thought i saw it on your desk and picked it up one i will get you before you leave we need to get that done
so we are going to pick up where we left off yesterday but i am going to review the expectations and i am going to show you some examples as well especially you the only one who was absent yesterday anyone else absent so we chose a multiplication problem and i did the example
attention i did the example 25 times 15 and i made up a story problem for that a word problem and the word problem is is teacher asked her to hand out 15 bingo chips to each of the students in her class students how many bingo chips does she need in total
one i come up with a word problem to go along with my multiplication problem part 2 is i need a solution to that problem i chose the box method to find my solution and stop attention i clearly write my solution
right she will need 375 bingo chips solution i write my solution and turning the question around representation i have 25 people those are my little people and 15 bingo chips each
375 now i am going to show you a couple of other examples
one so i did say it kinda ended up that a lot of you followed my poster which i expected you to
middle so depending on what your picture how much space your picture takes up if you have kinda this blank area you could show another solution did so she showed the lattice method and then she showed she actually showed 3 she showed standard and then she showed box to kinda fill in her poster so it did not have all this white space in there
so if you are finding that you have got some white space do another strategy answer her just as an example 23 people came to my birthday party bag how many goodies did i have to supply so there is her goody bags 18 each and her solution
is not done with his yet but his was kind of a cool idea his problem was 72 times 12 so his story is has 12 packages of candy
right in each package there are 72 pieces of candy method has 864 pieces of candy and these are his bags of candy and i assume you are putting 72 in each bag they are all going to go so that was his visual representation
any questions on the multiplication part of this assignment so i want to go over the next part which is division only because some of you will finish and you will be like what do i do next so i am going to show you the division expectations
so we are going to do exactly the same thing except now it is a division problem so i chose a larger division problem from so my division problem was 600 divided by 25
the word problem that i came up with can you guys see that can you see that 600 divided by 25 them i will pin them up back here if you need to look at them closer so my story is the chorus is performing tonight in the auditorium
show all 600 have to fit into 25 rows equally row so i did the partial quotient division which i have showed you 4 times 25 was 100 500 4 times 25 was 100
400 i decided to double it so it would not take me as long 200 subtract i get 200 and another 8 gave me 200 with no remainder 8 +8 is 16 +4 is 20 +4 is 24 solution i wrote my solution up here because i did not have room down here right 24 people will sit in each row
auditorium and can you see my little chorus performance up there work so this larger number does take some work finish so what i did was my 25 rows right and then 24 people in each row gives me my 600 people
that so that was a visual representation question do we have to do 3 this is no you do not no i will get the will you look on my desk i have them written down on a piece of white math paper division problems it says on it
it yeah i wanted to choose i noticed that when i did my multiplication example many people kinda copied exactly what i did so i wanted to give you an example that was a little bit bigger that i do not just giving you the idea of it
t how long did it take you to do this i did this it took me about a half an hour 20 minutes maybe yes why did you start off with circles and dots it is the same it just was easier cause it was a lot when i started doing 600 it almost would be the whole class in reading class so it was probably 45 minutes or more to make this
so let me just show you some of the other problems so you do not have to i can do a smaller example let us say 12 divided by 3
my mother made brownies or i made brownies my mom made brownies for me and my 2 friends
we shared them equally how many brownies did each person get
not maybe brown will work
tense did each person get 4 this is a simpler problem right this how could i show a visual representation
you could draw a plate of cookies of brownies i could draw her a plate of 12 brownies like a pan like a brownie pan
and then you could draw you and your 3 friends and then you can give them each a number like your 1st friend could be number one and your 2nd friend could be number 2 and you could be number 3
3 so is idea is friend number one friend number 2 and yourself right is that what you are saying yes and then give each one a brownie or could i do one one one 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 one 2 and 3 would not i brownies yeah what is another way i could do it
a can i say something in the problem you wrote did i write it wrong you did not put how many brownies you need 0 you 12 brownies we shared so my mom made 12 brownies for me and my 2 friends we shared them equally how many brownies did each person get
and remember sometimes this word problem 2 friends kids see the 2 and they divide by 2 come because it is a little bit trickier you said you and your 2 friends which makes how many people
3 that gets us every time right me if you do not include yourself you do not get any brownies that is right fun so let us go over just a couple more of the ideas as i hand these out
i do not know whose this is but 0 i like is so let us look at i like it too i know it is the problem she did 12 times 30 each how many dots were there in all
ways and she drew her 12 balloons one 2 3 by 4 gives you 12 wrong i am just trying to show you different ideas had his bags of candy was from the other class that who is this
j is having at each other birthday party people he is hoping that each person will bring a present worth $67 can you believe that each how much money would be spent on his presents
party 65 people are coming or 345 people are coming they are going to spend $65 on him although you still have $67 here that this says $65 honey and here it says $67
right and your answer you do not have the answer yet that and then we have it says thursday november 10th is my little brother is birthday 27 people are coming to his party my brother plans on giving everyone 20 kit kat bars
v all the supplies that you need i will do one more they are up whose is this mine is yeah it is 175 she did a large one times 48 there are 48 students in miss c and miss h is class
each student gets 175 pieces of paper for the year how many pieces of paper do the teachers need to buy so 48 students each get 175 pieces of paper which is probably a good estimate since there is 180 school days that would be a piece of paper a day right so that is not bad for and then of course her solution
the teacher needs to buy 8485 pieces of paper table and i am just going to hand the rest of these out as soon as you get them you may begin
i am going to put the division problems on the board can we get our supplies from the back i wish you would put your names on these whose is this d can you put your name it please can we go get supplies yes k if you are finished put it on the radiator and you are going to start a division one
e yeah your name should be on the story problem and sideways is not appropriate name whose is it
it mine who said mine come get it please teacher where do i put these are they done this is mine would you give this to k no this is
they are yours he does write neat e the rest of these did everyone get theirs no
more right here 0 there is my pencil
i colored it either i know i saw you this morning why do not you come up here and i can help you
you are done i would like some color on your kit kat bars please just look through those other ones here it is right here would it still be up here teacher i need something that group right there glue on top of it
sec teacher what honey whole sheet of paper look in my 2nd left drawer better dry erase left desk drawer can you look there 0 yeah
here boys and girls for the division posters i am going to ask you to use smaller paper
no 2nd or 3rd drawer honey so boys you are ready to go to division i am going to put some problems on the board that you can choose from okay
2nd where are you there honey why do not you do do the problem 15 times 30
so get a piece of yellow or white paper and you need to write a story problem for that
yes boys and girls do not forget you can check your math using a calculator make sure your answer is right before you color it all in
i am having a birthday party and i invited a certain number of friends stories so make up a problem a word problem for 15 times 12
sorry i could sit here well just sit there for a minute 23 and we were going to cover this up because it was not correct you small for division
i do not know what you did here for which part honey
ask and do it in pencil before you do it in marker boys and girls do it in pencil before marker so that if you do make a mistake you can fix it doing you do know or do not know
1st i took i am sorry those so you were going to do 5 so we wanted what was your idea honey
says i invited 15 friends which you spelled wrong you need to fix that for a sleepover cookies if each person gets 23 cookies how many will i need in all so you were trying to draw 15 friends with 23 cookies is that it
i am not even cutting it straight cause these scissors stink
i am going to draw people so how could i do 15 you could do what makes 15 right so that would give you 5 and 3 rows that might give you more space instead of 3 5 is
5 and then you want to put the cookies cookies are just going to do the numbers or i want to do like draw the number so show me one how you would like it to look
yet no like and i draw like the number right here 23 above it so you need 5 10 15 right then you would have 23 23 23 right and then like i did the total and you got it on the bottom
good who else needs help is this so this is your division there are 100 what there are 100 cars cars have you thought of something yet
you on the road r 0 a d road there are 20 lanes
huh so i would just the only thing i would say is there if there were 100 cars on the road r 0 a d fix that you would have to say each lane there are 20 lanes in there you would have to say each lane has an equal amount of cars
so you need to add that each lane has an equal amount of cars in it here how many cars in each lane
do we have a so you have you are going by this right good listen you can not people really poster i mean you can not do it on top of notebooks and everything else
it and my pencil was sitting here and i came back and my pencil was not here either really teacher what do we have to color in these circles i am sorry do we have to color in all these circles just do little dots can i do half or something whatever you want honey you can just just do the outside of it
right you could just color all you could just color it like crayon and just kinda color quick over with a few different colors
how many friends you going to invite 15 or 12 15 period i am can i use the bathroom yes you are going to start with 15 friends are coming but you have to spell the word 15 f do you know how to spell it
i really would like these multiplication ones all to be done today every single one of them i have my division problem i have 28 cookies and 6 friends board 0 i have to do one from the board yes your division problem has to come from the board please
15 friends are coming period so at your party you are going to give your friends 12 of something
them little bags of candy well what do we do at birthday we have goody bags we have 12 pieces of candy in each bag
excellent i am putting 12 pieces of candy in a gift bag for each right how many pieces of candy do i need do you see what i mean cause if each kid gets 12 pieces you need to know how much candy to buy right
it i wish these 2 were next to each other i am sorry i wish these red and green was next to each other so i could put that color right there what are you going to honey but you could have just changed the numbers so what was right right there is i have x amount of cookies and 6 friends and i want to share them equally so just change it to the different numbers
thing you just change the numbers a lot of space that is okay you could probably write that in marker about if you want you could just little birthday party decoration you know like a few balloons and boys and girls if you feel like like can i have that for a minute
is saying all mine has kinda some empty space party so i said put a few balloons and a few streamers to decorate it yes mister t the baker was going to make 64 cakes
cute if there are going to be 8 customers that is c u s t 0 where is your pencil it yeah and i did not say you could take it back while i was using it
if there are going to be 8 customers on that day the only thing wrong with this is that we have to somehow say they are going to get the equal amounts that they are going to each get the same amount so how could we do that
was going to make 64 cakes how if we said for 8 customers
down can we use this paper for the division yeah my brother had 48 pokemon cards good teacher how is this but i have no in the middle for what to i said if you do not have room if you have a lot of space 0 okay but if your picture takes up the space then you do not need to
it was just a lot of kids had like this empty space in the middle ooh could i do like equal sides all around it and stuff like that that is equal sides like division signs well what is your story about problem markers huh
markers it is about markers no because it is like well i was just saying it could go with the theme mister c has 144 students in his homeroom class that is a big homeroom class put the students in groups of 12
have you are all set paper good is 24 divided by 5 up there no all very good
i got 24 cookies and 5 friends and i want to share them equally honey that should be a period how many cookies will each person get good we are using the smaller paper back there for the division i am confused what is your question i said i was confused you got the same answer so you are good
is having a birthday party she is inviting 23 people people i was going to draw or 23 goody bags
question so 23 goody bags and 18 in each so like on the side do we equal what it means and then add it up down here so of course 23 is an odd number saying so 23 goody bags and then 18 each
e what is this 0 that is how much goody bags there was for each person you do not need to put that
11 11 is too big help so that should be capital p i e initials is not your name honey
you got to write your whole name so we are going to put that here
there so now let us do a rough draft can i use the bathroom yes how are we doing boys do you want me to shut that is that in your i am sorry
why boys i expect that to be done and you only have 20 minutes left here i am finished very good
put it on the radiator over there honey and then think about your division problem that the answer multiply how do you multiply could you do it
honey chatting trying to think
doing you all set with that okay you have not done much
that what is this so you added it up so that should your solution there are capital t is yeah let us do it in black period so the cafeteria has 24 tables
if 36 students sit at each table how many students are in the cafe tables so one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 you have still got a ways to go here look what do you use a ruler to do that
8 but see honey if you are drawing your picture you said there is 24 tables and 36 people at each table so you need 24 tables with 36 people sitting at each table
9 put 9 because 9 18 and 18 would be 36 right so you just forget what you did yesterday one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this should be 9
9 so we have so that is 9 and 9 is 18
one and this is table number 2 so you are going to need 24 tables them
so you are going to have to try to fit 24 tables in here so do not leave a whole lot of space in between the next one use a ruler and draw all 24 tables 1st
check here can you borrow that yeah is that your whose pencil this for the division for decoration yeah there were 48 classrooms going on a fieldtrip only 4 classrooms on each bus
48 that is not bad there are 48 classrooms going on a fieldtrip i would not say only 44 classrooms you need a verb will be on each bus
got a bloody nose period you all right i am sorry i got a bloody nose squeeze it forward do you want to go how many buses one s do we need
b u s e s rewrite it and let me see it when very nice excellent put it on the radiator people period can she use your pencil can i borrow your pencil for a minute people
capital each person is going to get 6 lollipops how many lollipops do i have to buy multiplication yeah that is multiplication so i invited 24 people
each person is going to get 60 i see you know what i mean now you want to do 24 divided by 6 24 why do not you say the total lollipops you have what that would be
i have 24 pieces of candy and 6 people are coming how many yeah if we split them equally how many we get miss c e r sir is having a pizza party period people is it still bleeding honey
do you want to go to the nurse go yes honey get a calculator and check the answer make sure it is right calculators are next to where is
class how many people will sit at each table
people at one table or each table i would say each table
each capital f good so was your answer correct
neat is that as neat as you write yes can you give me the scissors honey back there and a glue stick i got scissors here this paper on this one has marker on it
more thank you here so you are going to put this then you are going to put your problem
it you can use a ruler and there is markers back there you can use and you just help her if she needs what she was not there she was not there is it still bleeding yep well you know what get another piece
yes you know what honey we will just cut one of these in half mister m was baking 60 cupcakes for 12 people that teacher do we have to write the solution yes solution honey so fold it in half
wonder if i should fold it in thirds half is fine we will just fold it in half
better boys and girls let us just stop for a minute and can anyone share one of their division problems their division stories with me
us could everybody stop what they are doing for a 2nd candy how much candy is each person going to get excellent you want to share yours up take is poster so i can use that too
anyone else have their division poster in the works you mister
c has 144 students in his homeroom class he put his students in groups of 12 how many groups will he have very good
math what have we been talking about what has our unit been focusing decimals decimals and who can tell me some things abut decimals that we have learned
b if you add or subtract decimals the decimals have to be lined up subtract how to put decimals from least to greatest okay ordering decimals we are actually going to kind of do an activity on that today
yes changing decimals to fractions changing converting decimals to fractions finding equivalents yes job kind of hit on the head what we are going to focus on today and we are going to do math workshops so we are kind of working on all those parts we talked about but to sum up our lesson we are going to do a group activity a partner activity
our object is we want to know how do you compare decimals what does the word compare mean bring together put them together to tell the difference so what is the difference between them
yes so our activity today before we start math workshop we are going to do a partner activity i went and i found raise your hand if you like the atlanta braves come on
okay i found 20 braves player is batting averages what do you think a batting average is how good they are at batting yeah every time a player comes up to bat that goes into their batting average so the higher the average the better they are at hitting the ball when it gets pitched to them thus getting on base so i found 20 different braves player is batting averages
we are going to take these averages and the 1st thing we are going to do is find partners and all i want you to do is cut them out you are going to have 20 different batting averages but the batting averages are going to look a little bit different than what we have been focusing on when we talk about decimals let us say i have this number what place is the 6
ones it is in the ones place 3 tenths tenths what place is this 2 yes i like how you make the hundredths the t h s sound if i were to add another number another place what place would we call this
this thousandths all right so we focused on the tenths and the hundredths place but with the batting average they go to the thousandths place today when you compare your actually before i give you instructions all i want you to do i am going to let you pick a partner because i trust you
then i want you and your partner to come up here either if you have scissors that is fine or if you have to borrow a pair of scissors all i want you to do is cut out your batting averages okay so go ahead find a partner
who is your partner together i am not used to working with a partner that is part of what we need to learn collaboration together what about you
girls i need your partner and and sit next to your partner all right all i want you to do and i am going to give you about one minute cut out your batting averages
out you are working with
so quickly cut these out
smart these 2 girls cut them in half so they are both cutting out some idea how come you 2 have not let us come up to my desk or something option please make sure i get these scissors back who else needs a pair of scissors excellent job
make sure with your scrap paper you have 20 averages any scraps you can put in the recycling
averages why do not you go and put those in the recycling you can share these scissors here is some scissors couple more minutes
is this recycling yes i will take your trash for you make sure you have 20 oops sorry
you have 20
please put your scissors down and i will let you get back to cutting in just a minute with your 20 batting averages you are going to compare these and we are going to put these in order from least to greatest so the least to greatest and what do these vocabulary words mean
least to greatest one is the smallest number and the other is the biggest so you want to find out who had the worst batting average and who had the best
so what was the smallest batting average and what was the biggest what if we come across a batting average and they are exactly the same agree i do not have everyone is attention
begin okay biggest please do not get confused and do the biggest to the smallest then once you and your partner have agreed on the order come up here and pick either a blue or green paper and i want you to glue your averages in order
if you want to put it in a straight line or make a design i do not care as long as there is an order to your batting averages glue put your name and your partner is name on the back of the paper
hand maybe do you want to come on this side
out what is your strategy 1st 1st we are doing the top ones we are going to see which ones are the highest what order do you want to put it in
okay look at me in i see you are starting with the biggest which is fine but when it is glued on to your paper what order does it need to be in least to greatest yes smallest to the biggest is this recycling you got them in order yeah you checked them keep your eyes on your own
ahead all right okay
i think we will put it like that put 2 across 2 that are the same maybe we should do each one like one right there and another one right there in least to greatest maybe you want to set them out before you start gluing gluing did you girls have a question
no i see a lot of groups have come up with their order and they are gluing
order is that your order 1st that one
since most of you have started gluing that is excellent let us see if we can be done in about 3 minutes okay minutes if not we can extend it a little bit but let us try to you are working hard
who caught the mistake good job
so if you finished putting yours in order please answer these 2 questions and you can just write it on the back or if you have extra room on the front that is fine what is the range of the batting averages and is there a mode mode once you have these numbers glued you can write it on the front or the back
questions boys and did you hear me about these 2 questions yes please show your work boys did you hear me about these 2 questions yes put your name put it on the front or the back care i like your design
questions you can write it on the front or the back on this is a whiteboard marker
okay i see you wrote 464 and 143 numbers what do you need you need your decimal excellent please be mindful of that
do we write this on the back you can write it on the front or the back questions put your name you and your partner is answer those questions
couple more minutes if you are completely done with everything come check and see if you put it in order correctly did you answer these questions just put it on that paper
perfect check yours and see if you put it in order correctly it starts right here
it goes up here to here to here excuse me
okay so is everybody working on the range yes order to me you are just wasting time number it goes up here to here to here
all right me and and i and i just noticed that when they said do the mode these could be the medians too because they are both more than one number number they can both be the mode
modes is that what you all put wait a 2nd this number is 464 and 143 are these whole numbers what did you forget 0 the decimal you have got to remember the decimal because you just told me 464 in middle school they will mark it wrong if you do not put it
it it is not just middle school it is elementary school as well check yes all right who is not finished
job boys and you told me several groups have made this mistake these batting averages are they whole numbers decimals why am i not seeing any decimals anywhere 464 that is not the same as this number
numbers what are we missing the decimal yes important all right
okay boys and girls since most groups are finished if you are not done excellent boys and girls what did you come up with for the range those of you that were able to solve it we came up with 321
go excellent what is the mode yes boys and girls did you see how and and your names are going to kill me this year do you see how and look
they did theirs in order from least but when they had a number that was the same boys okay so those groups who are still working are you all done no please put all the glue away and have a seat so we can start workshop and i will tell you what we are going to do today
okay girls are you all done seat we are going to break off into workshops today independent today
to so in this case 65 hundredths is blank than 32 hundredths greater than so you can think of it as your alligator eating the bigger number or i like to think of it as the bigger number has 2 points the smaller number has one and you connect them that helps me instead of the alligator
me any other in 1st grade my teacher whenever we did that she made us put the teeth inside okay
so that is one activity for independent and also independent you are going to be given a list of numbers and you are going to do exactly what you did but just by yourself and independent you are going to do by yourself and it is going to tell you directions this 1st group of numbers it says to put it in order from least to greatest but look the 2nd group it says greatest to least
so you have to pay attention to the wording and directions
go game group today you can play either make a whole or you can play the game that we just learned where you are going to need a whiteboard and you use your game cards so you can play with a partner and you are going to try to make the biggest number
remember you go to the hundredths place and the 100s place and you draw a number and you can put it anywhere you want but do not let your partner see where you are putting it then when you are done filling in your blanks you show your board to see who has the biggest number
game for my group today whiteboards and markers and we will be talking about decimals questions because of our time we will probably get to 2 groups today and we will finish a 3rd one later j does group 3 go to you right now group one comes to me group 2 goes to game and group 3 does independent work
just like normal yeah just like normal just how we always start
go i will give you guys time later
easy today i want us to use the base 10 blocks to represent numbers i am going to put some everybody i need you in your groups i want you to just write down this number that i am putting please write it as a decimal and a fraction
now why have you yet to get started do so show your boards job 66 hundredths what about this one
write this one as a decimal and a fraction
let us see everybody show your board
board looks like all of you got the decimal correct well almost have remember we talked about what the base 10 blocks represent how many wholes i have 3 wholes i am going to put that in my ones place
88 tenths how many hundredths 4 so we all did a good job with the decimal part 3 wholes 8 tenths 4 hundredths so 3 and 84 hundredths now as a fraction remember decimals and fractions they represent the same thing part of a number
if you do not have a whole number it is going to be fractions and decimals how many wholes do you have no we are going to have 3 wholes and then what is our fraction
3 then we have 84 hundredths does everybody see this represents our whole number and then this is our fraction amount yes
now just curious why did that confuse you you did excellent with your decimal why did the fraction confuse you i thought you were supposed to put like what put i put that too this represents how many wholes we have leftover let us try another one do the same thing where you write the decimal where is my eraser
one they took yours thank you
right your mistake was you have to make sure you count one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 it is 8 hundredths excellent it is 5 wholes and 48 hundredths what about this number
sorry okay write this number for me
yes my nose itches sick show your boards
okay so you all did the decimal correct you said you have 2 wholes and i like yeah 2 wholes did we have any tenths no no but we still have to hold the place and how many hundredths 5 excellent correctly as a fraction you all told me there is 2 wholes there is 5
10 you told me that is 5 tenths this is what you are showing me instead of 5 hundredths you showed me 5 one 2 3 4 55 tenths
look at the difference if i just had tenths then i would do tenths but if it goes to the hundredths place then you are going to do hundredths look this is 5 hundredths look at how much bigger this is 5 tenths
what if i did this 5 tenths how could you put this over 100 numerator not 550 this could be 5 tenths or 50 hundredths remember we talked about this the other day
same show me one 2 3 4 show me what you need to do me what do you have to do to that is 5 tenths what do you have to do to make it 50 hundredths you are all doing something but you are not talking to me
what do you have to do to make that 50 hundredths we need to make 5 of these 5 of those then just break them apart remember we said that this represented a 100th tenths excellent all right i want to go ahead and rotate because i want to get to the other group how do you feel
impressed we have only been talking about this 3 days and i feel like you are doing an excellent job how do you feel with decimals do you feel comfortable yes
okay let us rotate who else is in this group
okay 1st of all aint that aint yours correctly that is not yours thank you and this is not an appropriate time
group here are some base 10 okay are we ready yes
blocks based on what we know about base 10 blocks and decimals and fractions please write what is this modeling show me the decimal and the fraction write this as a decimal and a fraction okay
let us go ahead and show it
excellent we all did okay complete you have 6 tenths excellent i saw you looking on
fraction this fraction that is your decimal 0 i did not know how to do that who can explain the fraction to me i took the 6 and put it over 100
yep so you have 66 hundredths and then how do you explain the 22 yeah you just put that in front b sorry excellent this is 2 wholes and 66 hundredths any questions about this
yes you put 5 wholes 0 tenths and 9 hundredths excellent excellent that is okay there any questions about that
challenge instead of me giving you the base 10 blocks i want you to use the base 10 blocks okay
board so if i give you this number show me 3 and 4 sevenths with base 10 blocks
line that is okay just a brief sketch i am still confused as to why you are walking around
work 3 and 4 sevenths excellent show your boards excellent all right
how do you feel with decimals good okay how do you feel about comparing decimals good all right what about rounding decimals good excellent job you guys did a good job today clear your boards boys and girls everybody clean up please and head to your seats
up you guys you have not done independent have you
no i want you to go to independent clean your boards grab your sheets and go to independent markers put the board up
seats can you put this box over on top of this one heavy thank you summary boys i need you to clean quickly
sheets who did not get one not right now who else did not get one who else did not get one of these clean your boards
so boys and girls how do you compare decimals what was your strategy today when you were looking at decimals at the batting averages strategy you know what you should be at your seat because you are not even in that group
give me my marker please next time instead of whiteboard you guys can use paper and pencil because you can not handle the whiteboard markers me what was your strategy today when you were doing the batting averages and putting them in order
m comparing fractions comparing fractions comparing fractions from a decimal dividing decimals that is what you guys did today with your batting averages
when i gave you this assignment and after you cut all the pieces what was yours and is strategy to put in order compare the baseball scores how did you go about doing that
right underneath we put them in different categories all the wholes the 1st numbers we put them into different groups so and their strategy was put it based on the tenths place so all of the numbers that start with a 4 in the tenths place they put in a group
all the numbers that start with a 3 they put in a group all the numbers that start with a 2 in the tenths place and a one they put in a group 1st what is going to be the bigger number 4 tenths or 110th tenths so they compared that and then within the group what did you do next
at then we looked at the so then you looked at the tenths place then the hundredths place compare yes so this was easy yes okay me excellent job today
work it is almost lunch time
make sure you have those 3 books let me tell you what we re going to do b let me tell you what we re going to do today we re going to finish the fraction activity that we did yesterday
i know you need to sit up and listen journal i m talking right now we re going to finish the fraction activity that we did yesterday and then we re going to do another new activity we re working comparing fractions because they re not all the same size right right okay so if you guys could not take anything out yet
just look up at the board for a minute and i just want you for a 2nd just try and think about try to remember what we were doing yesterday place so we were talking about what s really important when you talk there s something that s really important when you re talking about fractions and it starts with a w
no okay so what can you tell me about don t don t i m going to give you another hint and then you can guess again you can t call out you can you take your seat now okay so when you were looking at this yesterday when you were looking at these were all of your answers the same no but a lot of the questions were the same weren t they
yes okay why were the answers different even though a lot of the questions were the same j the fractions what changed the whole ah
little when we talked about if you used the if you re touching things before it s time we won t get to touch them when it s time because these are tools not toys okay so one of the 1st things we did is we used how would you describe raise your hand okay and that was what we called the smaller hexagon cause this is a hexagon too right
yes and remember we did that example with the big pizza and the small pizza so you could think who remembers right well let s say this was a pizza and this was a pizza and i told you that i wanted half i m going to share with you and i wanted half the pizza and i was going to give you half
so i ll take half of this pizza and you can have half of this pizza who would take that deal sh i m going to take half of this pizza and i m going to give you half of this pizza okay who would not take that deal sh
k because that one s smaller i want a big yeah because i m saying half but if it s not the same well use your word word okay
so we re just going to review really quickly and then we re going to when we look at this small hexagon and let s see maybe you should remember because it s kind of i bet you guys would be better if i moved it up yes that s better okay
so how would you describe what one hexagon what is the fraction that i m sorry what rhombus rhombus what is one rhombus of that whole 13rd beautiful what is 2 rhombuses of that 2 thirds 2 thirds okay what about when we move to triangles decide how many triangles made up the whole
6 great so if the whole is 6 triangles then one triangle is what here so if the whole is 6 triangles then what would one of those triangles be t 16th say it louder 16th so let s show
so 16th 2 sixths help me out 3 sixths one half 4 sixths do not call out 4 sixths we re talking about sixths now then i ll let you answer 5 sixths 5 sixths 6 sixths sh
okay when i got to 3 sixths yelled something out okay so that brings me to so you guys said it was 3 sixths and he said it was one half
why because well half of 6 is 3 and half of 6 is a half half of 6 is 3 so it s a half of that there is a lot of ways to explain that but that is a good way so we didn t do the trapezoids and that would help because she wasn t here so can you tell me one trapezoid is what fraction of that shape
use how many did i use to fill in the shape us how many like numbers in between do you need some help how many groups or parts so how many trapezoids did i use to make this up
what i don t know how to pronounce it 2 though 12nd half half can you say that half it s not 12nd it s one half okay so told us that one half is the same as 3 sixths can i use those fractions as to prove that
would you argue with me that one half but it has to be what one half of this whole whole okay so now we can take over from where we ve been so you should be with the same partner there you should have this paper and that s all you need to take out right now
one of these should be on your table already
i just want to tell you something not to make you feel but for you to understand yesterday my other group finished all 3 pages in here we did not finish 2 thirds we did not finish 2 thirds have a seat right now lap put your hands in your lap
i need everyone to think about how and and and and copy when i ask for your attention they get it right away them you re wasting a lot of time so let me repeat my directions take your everyday math book
197 now you may move near i said be quiet you are going to go put your seat no no right here quickly sh up so we re going to do a little bit we re going to go over this page
now you don t need any who can finish number 7 checking so i m going to ask you and you re going to answer me what shape are we working on for this page could someone raise their hand what shape are we working on yeah and how would you describe that shape they called it what
book they called it a a double hexagon and one of the mistakes or one of the misconceptions that a lot of people have is they count this as 2 like 2 wholes because it is 2 hexagons
one anything that s smaller than this double hexagon is less than one which would make it a fraction okay one it said and you re going to get to do the next page right now we re checking and i might ask some of you to come up here or i want you to check and make sure you have the right answer from yesterday
questions remember what i said if we don t get through what we re supposed to it has a lot to do with time that you re wasting
a loud how with trapezoids good that was loud which fraction of the shape is covered by one trapezoid 2 trapezoids and 3 trapezoids so i covered shape b with trapezoids okay
no so we covered shape b with trapezoids and it took how many trapezoids question what fraction of this shape is covered by one trapezoid 14th 14th is there anyone that doesn t understand that
t yeah okay what part of this shape is covered by 2 trapezoids and you already told me you didn t tell us that now what part of this whole is covered by 2 trapezoids one good one half what part is covered by 3 trapezoids
3rd is that 13rd watch just count 14th 2 fourths say it it s okay yeah if this is a 4th then if this is a 4th of this shape and there s 123 right we can go on to the harder one all right
what 2 trapezoids no wait who s with us y go ahead 3 rhombuses 3 you know what up i got all these sorted the fat ones and the skinny ones and now i m mixing em up so i appreciate when you put em back you try to do that
okay so it says to cover the shape 0 my goodness okay with rhombuses right okay so what part of each shape is one rhombus 2 rhombus one rhombus we said how many did it take all together
everyone 6 okay what fraction is one rhombus 16th 16th what does the next question say this is one of my favorites what fraction is 3 rhombuses one half one half anyone write down a different answer sh
b you wrote 3 sixths and you wrote one half
why because one is a half because 3 sixths count them 123 is the same as a whole no it s not a whole look what is it of yeah picture can you see in that picture that it s covering half
raise your hand if you can see from this picture that those rhombuses are covering half of that shape okay 5 rhombuses who haven t i picked on yet b 5 fourths no
k 05 sixths b try and think before you raise your hand because you could have had that answer okay covering the shape with triangles
we re not going to go through the whole thing because i think is there anyone in here that didn t finish 12 so if it takes 12 of something if it takes 12 of something to fill up a whole how could you describe that as a fraction
h a 12th a 12th or let s just use a number of math 112th great okay so i just want most of you are finished with this page and i m going to let you work in groups and go around and help you because some of you are ready to go ahead now because the last page is hard so i want to show it to you before we do it
and i don t want to show you the answers all right so could you just turn to the last page so that we can talk about it and then i m going to let you work in groups and ask for help from me when you need it we re going to take 15 minutes to do that and then we re going to do another activity focused okay so on page 198 what has changed again what s changed
what s changed the hexagon group so what thing has changed that we re doing no has the size of the triangle changed no
what s changed the sides of the trapezoid well the sides of the the hexagon is bigger but we re working with what s that word i wanted you to have you need to stop i asked you to think about before up come here what has changed the whole the whole
okay when the whole changes if this triangle is 16th of this hexagon do you think it s also going to be 16th of this hexagon
that i really appreciated that most of you half of you have not picked up your pencil yet have not picked up pattern blocks because if you listen now you won t be confused in a minute
all right so i want you to look at the shape we re working now a big hexagon and you re going to answer the same questions but as we just saw the answers are not going to be the same when you get to the bottom 16 read question 16 really loudly and slowly cover shape c completely stop stop
confusing cover shape c completely using one or more trapezoids or triangles or hexagons okay stop there so you re going to use one or more you have to use at least one triangle one trapezoid one rhombus and one hexagon that s the rule but then how you fill in the rest of it that s up to you
so is everyone going to have the same picture no so keep reading but slowly the hexagon below label it with the okay so you re going to use either your straight edge or somebody found that it was easier just to use the pattern block to trace to do the same thing that you ve done
some of you have not quite finished with the 2nd one so you re going to show the pattern blocks that you ve used and then you re going to write the fraction this when you re on the page before you re writing the fraction of shape b whole okay all right so are there any questions about that
okay what s the 1st thing you should do if you kind of feel like you re fuzzy and you don t quite understand the directions j ask before you even did that no there s something that because you re in 4th grade and you re so smart what could you do
it because just cause someone read it to you it doesn t mean that reading it again isn t going to help you so i m going to walk around
good so you guys was that a fraction no
it yes yes yes
explain it to me read it no no no
i hear a lot of good math talk and now i m hearing a little bit of talk that doesn t sound like math
and you know math is the only talk i want i m coming around if you have a question
so okay so if 6 of these make up this whole shape then what would one be
sh but i m still waiting that means you re ready to listen it s the 70th day of school and it s taken me 510 seconds to get your attention
i m giving you about a 5 minutes more maybe i ll give you 6 or 7 stop if you don t finish the 3rd page that s okay
how many rhombuses is this sh
okay everyone everyone stand everyone turn to page 197 lap and look at the label at the top everyone me so that whole thing
this this this is one up take a seat away from the please step away please right there thank you this is 11 so if this is one what is this
k one half one half one even if you look at the work that you did yesterday above you did all this work
you have all the fractions written down so that you can label those shapes
16 a lot of you i see are working on 16 when you didn t do 13 14 and 15 and 13 14 and 15 help you to figure out what part of that shape each one of those pattern blocks is
you got to put something on top of it so you don t even okay
on i think we may have to extend this one more day at least you tell me do of these make up this
i have to say i know some of you are playing games i m talking now to your voice sh i see a lot of improvement this is a hard concept especially when you re talking about different wholes
this is hard do you understand this yes
when i 1st said what is a whole so this is the whole sh
nothing so i m going to put on a timer when that timer goes off i really need you to do 2 things clean up and take out your math composition book and we re going to keep working with these patterns and we ll do some more tomorrow
not bad nice not bad
i think you need to i am
okay we re going to do one more fraction activity and i want you to clean up now open your books so you guys are going to have a part in this
so the 1st thing you re going to do is open your book and quickly write your date and time write it the short way 128 quickly whoops you re getting better at this guys but not great sh
what does that look like what does that look like a fraction a fraction and what part is this
this the word up there you can look at if you need it a denominator the denominator okay so you re going to have to listen otherwise you re going to have not enough room on your on your 0 you re using paper so what you re going to do is you re going to draw a little diagram that looks like this also draw extra boxes and this is going to be the discard box
trash so you re going to get a choice you re going to get to s going to roll the die and i m going to give you a number the number that he rolls
answer so let s just do it once and you ll see what s going on one so i want you to pick whether you want to put your one and i will tell you this is not who gets the biggest so if you want to put your one in the numerator the denominator or the discard
there so put it in wherever you want sh box sorry i didn t say that draw the box or just write the numerator or the denominator repeat rolled a one
you get to pick whether you re going to put that one in the numerator box the denominator box or the trash and once you put it in there you can t take it out put it in now waiting i need to see everyone with that number in a box
now write a number in the i m going to say it again who knows what to do okay so i m thinking i think i gave pretty good directions so i m thinking if you don t know what to do at this point you need to be a better listener and i ll say it one more time choose either in the numerator box the denominator box or the discard trash can
again and i rolled a 4 now i put the 4 in one of the 2 boxes that remain
now i know but what if we want to put the 4 you can t them whoops now i rolled a 3
dang guys what are you danging do you even know what we re doing no activity i m going to follow directions there s no good or bad
now using this shape a circle as the whole draw your fraction hah go ahead you should each have a fraction you should each have something written in the numerator sh
so i repeat my instructions doing you should have one number up here and one number down here sh i can t you can
and if you can t we ll help you okay i m going to go to a new page so that i promise you someone said we can t me yes ma m would you believe me if i promised you that everyone can draw their fraction
good i m glad would you believe me if i told you i was having problems with my smart board yes me okay 30 more seconds and then we ll see what we can do i m just going to write up here the numbers that we rolled we rolled a one
13 a 3 and 4 and 4 so some of you have one in the numerator some of you have 3 in the numerator some of you have 4 okay all right who has drawn their fraction okay it s wrong how do you know it s wrong that s not a great attitude 0 you do
well why would that be wrong wrong what makes it wrong hold on you if you re too far away to pay attention you really need to come up i m letting you sit back there cause i know you can see and you guys are focused but if you re not you need to move up
okay so we re going to start with because said i did a fraction but it s wrong so okay see so what did you put in the numerator i put in the numerator 4 okay and what did you put in the denominator 3 okay so how many circles did you have to draw 34 or more really
us 4 circles does that mean 4 wholes you would draw 3 circles why because that s the denominator and okay hold on put your hands down i want to put your hands down please i want to look at the denominator and i m going to do was says it i don t think we you know what i want you to work on
i m not going to call on you if you raise your hand i want you to work on not calling out so i think this is not quite even but i m going to divide that in thirds okay because i know that keeps telling us that that s what that denominator means it and i m going to color in 13rd 2 thirds 3 thirds did i shop my fraction
need i need one more what circle one more what though one more 3rd how will i show one more 3rd absolutely does that picture show that fraction yes no i know what you mean by wrong though what could you call it
mixed fraction no it s not mixed wait it s not a mixed number what do we call a number if the numerator is bigger and you haven t turned it into a okay so it s improper but that doesn t mean wrong in math
in who took them and but and are fine yeah so you told you told and to go where tell them to go to teacher w s class teacher w
not teacher b fine just tell them don t come back to this door okay we ll come get them what are you talking about the no we re not doing over you can go when we walk out for you didn t get to go okay we ll go we ll do it on our way out
stop all right put it on his desk no please take out your calendar math school 66th
school what multiple do we need to add or what shape do we need to add do we need to add any shapes to 66 no heart a heart anything else
no just a heart are you saying stuff to just say it just to be talking why do we what do we when do we put stars on numbers when you have to be able to explain it okay before you just say it
d heart and a triangle heart and a triangle why because the heart huh 60 okay a triangle because okay is absolutely right and he discovered something new said because it s even
it s a heart and a triangle okay so add the heart and the triangle to your 66 on your paper we have today is the 66th day of school then we should have 66 pennies correct yeah so go ahead and add a penny
look at the clock we said that the hour will stay at 12 but how does the numbers change
date so the date is i mean so the time is yes put that in your book bag and daily reviews calendar math okay we also need to add a piece of pie and a decimeter to our length and a piece of pie to our pie
pie looking at our pie how many fifths do we have d how many fifths on this pie on this pie together yes pies how many fifths pieces
one no yes how many fifths how many pieces of pie how many pieces of pie
what i just asked how many 14 fifths 14 fifths yes
22 and then this will be considered what 22 and 4 fifths 4 fifths because we have 1234 fifths and the pie is divided into fifths did we tell them not to come back okay
how many okay so today we added one decimeter to our length meters how many meters do we have one.4 one.4 one.4 does anyone remember and we talked about this briefly does anyone remember what the place value is directly behind the decimal
no i mean hundredths huh something with a th at the end 100th not hundredths but close tenths tenths yes because each of these is 110th of a meter so we have one whole meter and then we have 1234 tenths
so we say it one.4 meters but really it s one whole meter and then 4 tenths of a meter okay that s how that goes then if each one of these is 10 centimeters or represents 10 centimeters 140
140 centimeters and how many decimeters good okay we need to multiply the date times what for our daily depositor
the date times multiple students 20 it what is it 14 times 20
280 okay let s think about this without the paper and pencil 10 times 20 put your stuff in your book bag 10 if we re looking at 14 we can break 14 down into expanded form
200 and then so we got we handled the 10 now 4 times 20 would be what
200 then we add 80 or 8 tenths to our 3 who thinks we have enough to add to change the 10s in for 100 count 123456789 10
okay that leaves us with 110 and we ll put our 100 up which will make our the ones the ones what do you mean the ones the ones place 0 i m sure we will one day
tomorrow we are we do the same thing
it says toby mowed lawns for 3 summers in a row $1289 the 2nd summer he earned $2098
summer the 3rd summer he earned $984 $984 question asking how much money did he earn in all rounded to the nearest 1000 so we could say how could we re state this to answer it
yes toby earned blank dollars in all okay all right now how do we solve it
it add every summer up the 1st 2nd and 3rd summers
$4371 have we answered the question it so it says round rounded to the nearest 1000s place place 44 yes your bag
get out your daily review okay so the 4 is the number we underlined same everything behind the 4 becomes a 00 have we answered the question yes yes toby earned we can say about $4000
number 2 sue bought a pair of pants for $98 and a shirt for $36
spend how can we re state the question yes ubtract how can we re state the question so that we make sure that we re answering it
asking about how much money did she spend okay so sue yes
okay about right all right now we need to figure out how to solve it the pants shirt the pants were $98
$36 but what do we need to do to the nearest 10s the nearest 10s why the nearest 10s because that s the yes that s the highest place value that they both have in common
so the 9 is in the 10s place and the 8 is the helper up go up to a 10 10 and everything after that 9 10 becomes a what 0 so 98 rounds up to 100
to 44 everything behind the 3 turned 4 becomes a 0 spend what do we need to do to these 2 numbers add them add them 100 +40 is 140 $140 so we go back and we say sue spent about $140 correct yes all right next one
there s some paper back there that i need laminated on the overhead now sue pete and joe collected marbles together so sue had 1463 pete had 2932 joe had 4632
they decided to give 1561 marbles to their teacher how many marbles do that s supposed to say how many marbles do they have now question everything number that they have how can we re state the question yes they have they have blank marbles now
all right now we need to figure out what we need to do does this look like one are we going to be doing a lot to solve this do we said they decided to put all their marbles together do add up the marbles add up and see how many marbles they had all together okay
so sue had 1463 pete had 2932 and joe 4632
up and this out here is their total total number of marbles okay 2 +2 multiple students 44 +373 +366 +6 121 +677 +9 16
22 +466 +288 +one
9 okay so the total number of marbles that sue pete and joe had all together is 9027 does that answer our question no okay all right then what part of the question do we need to be looking at read the next part that we need to be focusing on
they decided to give 1561 marbles to their teacher okay so what does that mean we need to do 9027 exactly right away from the total that they have because this is how many they re giving away
162 -6 can t do it okay he needs to borrow from whom the 9 becomes a 8 the one the 0 becomes a 10 yes the 10 becomes a 9 the 2 becomes a 12
12 12 -669 -548 -177 does this answer our question yes yes it says how many marbles do they have now after giving their teacher some they have 7466 marbles now were left
number 4 the school auditorium has 68 rows of seats and there are 46 seats in each row seat okay add it up
how many rows how many seats mark how many can be seated
yes how can we re state it says how many students can the auditorium seat how can we re state that so that we make sure we answer the question yes
can be what seated can be seated okay so now we need to set the problem up 68 and how many seats
okay we want to know how many people can be seated or how many students can be seated what how many students are how many how many rows how many seats there are in there total right out
right yes all right 6 times 8886 times 6 36 40 what do we need to do next 04 times 8 32 24 24 +3 27
8 +080 +224 +7 111 +23 does that answer our question right so we have 3128 students can be seated in the auditorium
true 35 and 5 times 7 is 35 it all right please put your daily reviews away
and your desks should be clear of everything except your pencil at this point
make sure that your writing is in your writing folder
yeah yeah because some of the kids that weren t supposed to be on the tape were walking in from somewhere else yeah yeah just yeah
okay take a look at the problem up there from yesterday or similar to the one from yesterday it divisor quotient dividend
think 2 people
0 before you flip them can you write down like so social studies because i haven t written it down yet i just checked them while i was eating dinner social studies here okay
ooh okay the 300 is a product the 300 is a product yes
is a factor also yes it s a factor also because we know that multiplication is the opposite of division so if we re looking at factors and factors how will we set up an equation for multiplication using these 3 numbers only
a 6 equals 300 300 is that right yes so have you figured out a way to check your division problems to make sure that they re right yep take the factor and the factor or the divisor and the quotient and multiply them and you should get this number
so if your quotient is not right then you won t get this number let s say we felt that 5 or 300 divided by 5 was 50 instead of 60 250 what would it be
250 so if i said if i had this as 50 and i said something doesn t look right about that it so i take my factor and my factor and i multiply it and i get 250
300 so then i know that this is wrong right all right good all right i m going to put some problems on the board some division problems and i want you to show me how you would solve them using the beans that i m going to give you okay just let me know or ask to borrow some from your partner if you don t have quite enough
but you should have quite enough of them i m not going to give you really big numbers yet
maybe i should do
finished okay so who can tell me how what was your thought process for what how did you get to group your beans what did you to do show 27 divided by 4 yes 27 groups okay
so then what would be your quotient or what would your answer your quotient
okay anyone else want to tell me how you grouped your beans and what the quotient is okay
but it wouldn t so i did 6 times 4 is 24 +and the remainder of it is okay so how did you group your beans okay did you count out 27 beans 1st or did like how did you get those 4 groups
because i did i put 4 i put 6 i put 6 beans in one in one place and i put another 6 beans in another place i do it how did you come up with 66 because i know that 6 times 4 is 24 and then that was the closest you could get to 27 without going over
okay so used her factors and she said i know i m going to have 4 groups because i m dividing by 4 could he go to guidance or the office
okay so she says she knows her multiplication facts and she looked at she knew that 4 was going to be a factor in this division problem and she knew that her quotient is basically a factor
so she said what 2 factors will come out to 27 or close to 27 without going over and she figured 4 times 6 was 24 and she did 4 times 54 times 7 that would be 28 and 28 is too much right so then she says 6 is going to be a factor so she made 4 groups of 6 and she said that she had how many left over
over who else wants to explain how they got theirs k 9 times 29 times 2
groups is 2 huh where does the 9 or the 2 go up here nowhere right so how could you take 27 beans what are we doing
how do you 2 groups of 9 is not correct +2 times 9 is 18 anyway that one just doesn t work out at all anyone else want to explain person the quotient is 29
29 so then how do we check our answer wait just 9 okay answer multiply the 44 times 9 is multiple students 36
no then that s not right yes it s 7 okay but how did you group your beans because i m looking at your desk and it has one big pile
answer it s 7 times 44 times 7 28 no that means it s not right yes have huh guys we re trying to figure out this number
you one way you could have done it was to make sure that you only had 27 beans right okay so if i m taking 20 eyes up front hands off the beans this under your desk
front if i m doing 27 divided by 4 right how many groups should i have either i m going to have 27 or i m going to have 44 how many groups should i have 44 okay so i give it s just like saying i have 27 pieces of candy and i want to divide it between 4 people like we were doing yesterday with the word problems
okay one group one person 2 persons 34 people there is my 4 groups so i have 1234 what if i give this person one
now 556789 10 11 12
27 do i have enough to give him one no so then do i need to take these back
okay so now i have 4 groups and i ve used 27 beans okay so now in order for me to find my quotient or my other factor i would need to count how many beans are in each group count 123456 so my quotient is 6
a 4 times 64 times 6 equals 24 24 doesn t match but there s my 4 groups of 6 and i have 3 left over
right so what can i do i can put the remainder up here remainder of 3 and that s fine but this still doesn t match yes you can add the 3 to the 4 if i add 3 to the 24 it is 27
match yes so that s the correct answer so when you have a remainder and you re checking it you check it with the 2 factors or the divisor and the quotient you check it by multiplying them and if you have a remainder you have to add the remainder
this okay so you have 123456 groups because 5 times 6 equals 34 okay
it seems like a few of you are finished so let s go ahead and explain this have what are you thinking i was thinking it was 6 okay you re thinking the answer is 6 but just looking at 34 and 5 how would you show that with your beans
r 555 groups right okay we re going to let work on that and we ll let we ll let explain is explain what he did to get his groups 5 of the groups they got 6 you had how many groups
6 why 6 groups groups you should have 5 groups how many beans are in each group
okay okay so thought about multiplication facts in his head here i know that 5 times 6 is 30 if i do 5 times 7 that s going to be 35 and that s going to be too much right yes so you did 5 times 6 you got 30 right did you have a remainder
i got 4 as the remainder okay remainder 4 yes 5 times 5 times 65 times 6 which is 30
30 30 doesn t match but we have 4 what do we do to the 4 groups so i say one group 2 groups 3 groups 4 and 5 groups and then i m just going to divide these equally until i can t divide any more
i don t have enough for everyone to get another one so i m going to call this a remainder and that s 4 and then in each group i have 6
okay all right let s i m going to come around and get your beans and we re going to try this paper and pencil without the groups because some of you seem as though you don t you don t need the beans to help you
it when i come around please have your beans in your hand so that you can drop them in the bag
that can you go and give out dry erase boards over there yeah yeah that s okay
it is anybody allergic to beans no i don t have any allergies in here except for peanut except for that you have allergies so you give them all here
shh guys come on why are you guys still having the beans on the desk i said when i come to you what are you doing
huh no you re playing around desk thank you for being i owe you a ticket
you if you want to eat it no
over okay so go check it i have a problem with this right here you see
do 8 okay how did you get 8 because i see some people drew pictures pictures so what did you do what 7 okay you circled every 7
huh 777 until you got close to 59 yep okay so how many circles did you have okay so you thought that 8 would be a good factor so you put the 8 up here and then you multiplied to check
all right so everyone please take out your 3 ring binders
day does anybody need lined paper paper oops
back to word problems yeah we are going to be working on a couple of different word problems today fine go ahead yeah i do not know where they are
your 3 ring binder needs to be out right yeah take it out please table of contents
okay i want to pass out i am going to pass out these word problems we are going to go over them one by one but we are not going to do all of them we are going to do some of them so just look at them for a minute while i pass them out
down yes do you need to move here because you are not paying attention yet you want this sh
are these the answers of what no
so they say percents okay so again did everybody write this down the 1st problem we are going to look at is this one
okay so this is okay this is the same problem as number one on your paper okay let me read this and i want you to think about it was i read it and you can read along too it says neli and anthony went to dinner at the olive garden
good they had good service and want to leave a 15% tip hand go ahead like a little extra cash a little extra cash service good service means that your waitress or waiter came over and helped you out got you new stuff and brought out the food in time
percent the meal cost $22.50 altogether okay so how do we figure that out when you have $22.50 okay and they want to leave 15% okay
out how do you figure out 15% of something if i said what is 12nd if i asked this just save it okay
what is 15% of one what is 15% of one.15 ¢15 excellent how do you know that
22.65 well that is the other problem how about just this problem something costs one i mean 115 one.15 so we have been kind of doing that with this problem okay what is 15% as a decimal 100 no as a decimal it is 15 over 100 as a fraction excellent
150.5 no 0.05515 yeah excellent so look up here fraction write this information down on that worksheet that i gave you because this will help you
excuse me yeah i did not need no paper i have got a bunch of paper right here okay great but write this down on that worksheet i gave you with a couple problems on it
how much money will they need to pay i know there what i am doing is i am trying to make you understand how decimals work when you are dealing with money
example the way we do it we go one times how much one times how much 5 150.15 up not when you are multiplying but i will show you how
here so this is multiplication with decimals and the way you do this it is $15 is this
multiplication so we go $15 hold on a 2nd 5 times 0 is 05 times 0 is 05 times one is 5 okay for the next one we have to put the 0 down and then it is one times 0 is 01 times 0 is 0 and one times one okay
15000051 but is that the answer no because you did not bring down your decimals do you bring them down work but the answer comes up to this
i am confused when you are multiplying decimals $15 actually why do not you move up here for this move because you guys are talking the whole time we are talking about math i will not you to not talk about math
now all right so you look up here look up here okay you guys have to pay attention for this there is 1234 spots with the decimals spots 1234
excuse me teacher come on excuse me $327.50 all right we will see
it okay 12nd 12nd okay just tell me how you did it
this so this problem is asking you what is 15% of $22.50 that this is yours i think from yesterday is that yours
yeah thank you okay so good job
d so if we use the same technique as we did before you have to count how many spaces there are to the right of the decimal point so there is 12341234 and let me just did everybody get this
here okay copy this down real quick please what what did you get
346 you need to do this 0 5 2 10 12 carry the one 11 yep 0 5 22 0 5 7 3 it so the tip so 15% of $22.50 is $3.50
¢37 and a half cent to so if we round this up to the nearest penny that would $3.38 okay now what do we do with this i do not know
what do we do with that number to find the total number what number what do we do to find the total number you need to sit back here and you can not be roaming around okay then you need to set up here and put your head down
okay so to find the total amount we have to add 22.50 plus $3.38
we are adding them why because this is what the meal cost right and this is the tip we want to give the waitress or waiter so altogether it would be added together 25.88885 and 2 and the decimal is right there okay
but teacher why are they do the math and then like the people they have to show the money what do you mean when you go to a restaurant you do not have to do the math the waiter shows you how much it will be do if you go with a big like a lot of people sometimes they add in the tip already
bill next time you go to a restaurant with your parents look at the bill so you kind of take a look at it and ask them how they figure out the tip because a lot of people do it kind of like that head okay if i said yeah sometimes people are just like 0 they really good job so i am just going to give them a $20 tip
tips so we have let us do this one real quick if i wanted to give someone a 10% tip on $10 how much would that be 10% of $10
so you know come up with $10 and you are going to tip 10% what is 10% of $10
$12 what is that $2 $2 what is 10% as a fraction again
fraction that is $100 no yeah 110th that is a fraction but like altogether it is a 100 does that make sense
no okay well let us try it over here so 10 and then 10% okay and we could do it the same way but if you think about this what is 110th of $10 if you break $10 into 10 pieces how would that be
dollar and if you did the math right here that would come out to be one okay good the next problem i want you to look at is this one right here it is problem number 2 not problem number yeah actually it is problem number 2 take a few minutes and do that one right there
write they gave you the decimal right there 0 yeah okay do it as a it should be as a percent as a fraction as a fraction and a percent you are right no that is what it is saying ou put decimal in parentheses
on i do not mind if you work together a little bit on this teacher if i have 0.8 as the decimal and the percentage would be 80 or just be 8 that it would be 80% but i want you to know why
go so it says write 80.80 as a decimal and a percent so instead of as a decimal you can put it as a fraction
that it just says that okay so if we did this as a fraction what would the fraction be
so if we add like we did that last problem we have point equals one over 10 okay equals 10% it is 100 over 80 be 100 over 80
the percent 80% it would be 80% okay said this would equal 80% and he is correct
be 8 tenths 100 over 80 80 over 100 it would not be 8 tenths it would be 8 over 10 that is what i said okay but you know something you said something that is interesting too and you are correct that would also equal 80 over 100 because that is the same thing
stuff 80% of something is the same as 8 tenths of that something that 81 hundredths of that something because with this the difference is how much of this whole candy bar or whole whatever we are talking about is being eaten
so if 80% is right about here somewhere and if all the if i said well i ate 8 tenths of that candy bar it would be the same as is saying i ate 80 over 100 80 hundredths of that okay no you have to wait a few minutes
okay one problem i want to do on this form this worksheet i gave you is the stop shop problem board you can read it and then i will put it up and i will read it again
why i know why you might know this this is called how to find out like what the best deal is when you are going shopping if you see something for like $2 and something 2 for $4.50 the $2.50 might actually be cheaper in the long run and this is a problem like that again it says at stop shop a pack of oreos with 30 cookies is $3.50
here is $3 yeah one tends to have more cookies but it says at shaw is a pack of 25 oreos is $3 i thought shaw is had an n but 0 no that would be shawn is okay
and a pack of 25 oreos is $3 using unit rate determine where you get the best price when they talk about unit rate that means how much is it per item
so how much is this is stop shop and this is shaw is okay divide we divide 3 300 by yep into 25
12 and then we have to do the other one too 350 into 30 3 this is actually $3 here 0 see how much each of those oreos cost i want you to do this problem
yeah okay good what is that you okay you okay fell okay now let us continue with this
here so what did you say over here d this comes out to be ¢12 what does it mean it comes out to be ¢12
j subtraction but what does the ¢12 represent anyone where you get the best price of oreos at what is the price of the oreos at shaw is $3 but it is like no price per oreo
01 oreo is ¢12 is getting all the answers she is getting everything right cents so one oreo at shaw is is how much cents ¢12 now how about over at stop shop it ¢11 it is a little bit over ¢11
like ¢30 because i got remainder 20 deal stop shop stop shop is a better deal
it looks like it is more money but it is actually cheaper in the long run when you go to the stores they have these things if you look they ask you per unit but i have a question go ahead you know how you get catsup what is that you know how you get catsup yeah and it can be like $4
the small you pay $4 and the big one is 5 something exactly yeah you know how it has ounces what if it was 16 ounces how much would one ounce cost very good
example she said what if you have a big bottle of catsup and a small one
$3 this is $4 deal well you could how many ounces does it have how many ounces so this could have 12 and the other one have like 36
36 so this one looks like 0 this one is more expensive than that one but would probably come out this would be cheaper per ounce okay unit it does yeah on all the shelves unit price
there now they put that there and they put the unit price on the shelves to help the people that are buying find the best deal
one the cheapest one okay okay yes yeah we are going to do an order of operations
here what would be the $3 one
go ahead pemdas the brackets around you are right not brackets braces brace something like that parentheses exponentials multiplication division addition and subtraction okay so if we are doing these order of operations and they are important because we see them all the time
board can you put the other ones teacher what is that
the other ones no wait the other ones like this it looks like yeah it looks like yeah like that what is those called brackets what is the difference yeah brackets it is the same as a parentheses brackets what is the difference then we will talk about it
okay write these 2 problems down
paper write this down and we will go how we solve this
this last problem does not have any parentheses or any brackets in it paper lined piece of paper please give me that piece of paper what piece right there this one there you go
why do it have like that these are brackets and we saw them a little while ago teacher 12 times 8 is 96 right where would you get 12 from you did it different okay when you see these things look up here here when you do this that means you have to work on the inside outward so you start on the inside
so this is a 1st parentheses so you do that 1st 2 then we have to do it times 3 bracket okay but teacher why you do it like that what do you mean can i show you how i do it
right yeah i think so doing yeah come over here and just write that right beside it
and that is basically what i am doing over here things what is 3 times 2 excellent then you go 6 +9 equals how much
okay how about this one up here i want to do that one this one is a little bit straightforward okayay come on up here this one we have to go by this order of operations
you have to go multiply divided add or subtract multiplications yes which ones 1st what is 4 times 8 32 then we have 3 +32 take away 2
do wait what this is the problem 3 +4 times 8 -2 i did it different okay let us see if it comes up with the same answer you have to do it in this order
you have to do the multiplication 1st division 2nd addition 3rd and lastly subtraction 94 okay let us see if it is right okay then we are going to do 3 +35 because addition is next
35 then we are going to take away the 2 35 take away 2 equals 33 okay you have to use this order
you have to go multiply divided add and subtract more you guys have to sit down please
that let us do one more problem and it is going to be like this one this okay
right teacher just do it write this down okay down what is the 1st thing we have to do
did you write this down what is the 1st thing 3 times 2 do 3 times 21st so 3 times 2 is 6
then we can okay what is next after that next 7 +6 is 13 6 plus oops 6 +4 is how much not
huh 6 +4 6 +4 is 10 okay 13 take away 10 is how much
33 so your answer is 3 okay all right any questions the answer is 3 correct the answer is 3 did anybody get 3 as an answer did you get it
this okay
one you can copy is can you see that far here i am throwing it away then write this down
it where that 14 times 9 take away 3 times 5 do the ones in parentheses 1st so that would 4 times 9 is 36
take away 3 what is 36 take away 3 33 then we have 33 times 5 okay what is 33 times 9 165 i mean 33 times 5
165 okay okay any questions any concerns
yep teacher so if they had like 12 times 12 +6 take away 6 how are you going to figure that whole thing out 12 times 12 equals 144 +6 yeah you have to go down you have to go down the whole line and you have to do it in that order you just keep that pemdas or please excuse my dear aunt sally yeah my dear aunt sally
you have to go down that yeah but you have to go down that order messed like if i did this one actually that one would come out like if i did another problem like this and i did not go in the right order i would not get the right answer
why watch because i go 7 +6 is 13 take away 3 is 10 times 2 is 20 -4 is 16 so if i went straight down this one the answer would be 16 but the answer is really 3 because when you do it the orders of operation this changes it okay okay
one question can everybody in here multiply and divide by 10
yes easy to multiply and divide by groups of 10 is very simple not 10 20 30 but 10s 100s 1000s etcetera today we re going to be talking about the metric system
yes ma am yeah so this is going to be really an extra easy day for us because we ve already spent some time working with the metric system
take one and pass it down turn it over to the back and write your name
0 you have to move yes
8 from the bottom i want you to count up to the 4th flap
i want you to write on the 4th flap base
bottom so one 2 3 4 write base unit then flip it all the way back and open up your foldable
there what do you see raise your hand on your page c yes and there s a bunch of letters
everybody needs to be on the 4th page of their foldable where it says base unit and fold it back
with your highlighter i want you to highlight the m on your stamp that s what we re dealing with is the middle
board in the metric system let s see if we remember our problem last week at star base what s the metric measurement for a length what do we use
c i forgot mister b meter length was meters
measure what else can we measure we can measure how long something is what else how much water in what s that called volume what do we measure volume in in the metric system does anybody know capacity what s it called mister
m volume what s it called mister m liter liters see you thought i had a soda in here just because i was being greedy
capacity length l e n g you for your t
if i want to find out how much matter was in 0 i don t know thing how much matter does thing have
unit well 1st of all what s that called called is what are we measuring i want to find out how much matter is in this what s it called
weight no weight is the measurement of the force of gravity on an object pulling it down that s weight mass what do we measure mass in
pounds not in the metric system grams grams like graham crackers right no i like graham crackers
mass anything else temperature but in temperature we don t talk about kilo degrees or millidegrees those are the prefixes
degrees so we re not going to put temperature in this why don t you have the words base unit written like you were asked to write
the really cool thing about the metric system once you learn all your prefixes and how to work them it s the same thing for whatever you re measuring
not like in the english system where what do we measure length in in every day life in inches inches and what do we measure capacity in in everyday life
m gallons and cups and quarters and what do we measure weight in or mass in in the english system pounds so you don t have to learn 3 different systems and get all confused did you know the united states is one of the only countries that does not use the metric system
it makes so much more sense to use the metric system but people were afraid that the world would end when i was growing up in the 70s we were supposed to go to the metric system and people freaked out why i don t know but there was a major freak out when i was a kid
0 my gosh we re going to have to go to the metric system and it s so confusing and we would not know if it s going to snow because it s like 0 degrees and 0 degrees is actually warmer than fahrenheit 0 degrees everybody was freaking out so we never did it
yes are lazy they are because people don t want to change anything stubborn stubborn more like 3 year olds 2.5 year olds all right now we re going to go bigger 1st and then move smaller
don t squish m so whether or not we re measuring length capacity or mass our base unit is always a base unit and it s always one
11
flip go up one flap on this flap up one
on this flap i want you to highlight dam
now this is a decameter and capitalize this one
decameter deciliter decagram do we have to write all of those yes you are going to have enough room just don t write like a giant
across if you write it up underneath the stamp how are you going to be able to read what it is flap look look
line you write it right here see hold yours up so your tablemates can see job good job
good all right multiplying and dividing by 10
how many base units do you think are going to make a decagram
101010 base units one decagram
10 feels like something else i learned when i was a little girl and we re using the same materials for it what do i use these for in other math
places and what is that called a place value place value because place value is based on what unit 10s if you understand place value you ll have no problem understanding conversions of unit
flap 0 i know i did not just hear someone saying shut up that s incredibly rude
i don t have incredibly rude children
let s see if we can do some extrapolating
there are your hector units
your hector units
awesome all right moving up to our very top flap
km km
and i m sorry i do not have cubes for everybody
we can build one we could but we re not going to
so if i have i m questioning if i have 3 kilograms how many grams do i have
3000 3000 you re right
3000 because kilo means 1000 because kilo means 1000 what made you want to multiply the 3 kilograms times a 1000 because i m assuming that s what you did
yes so i wonder yes on the yes we did you weren t paying attention
yes what can i convert it to i have 10 meters right here decameters how many decameters do i have
a 1000 you need to think before you open your mouth from here to here if i have 10 meters how many decameters do i have a 100 go back to that page
page if i have 10 meters how many decameters do i have 11 thank you now missus
g is going to change what one looks like
this is now a 11 so go all the back to your base unit page
so i want you to hold this in your brain for right now as your one they re not blocks we re not building with them we re not making ramps
unit we re moving small learning turn up your base unit page so then you get on the next blank page down
this is deci but the difference here is it s d e c i
now we re chopping the one up and we re going to chop it into 10 pieces
so now it takes 10 deci units to equal one unit so it s the unit divided by 10
so if i m going to write one divided by 10 what decimal number do i have yesterday what decimal do i have of one divided by 10
m 10th it s this fraction so how do i write that fraction as a decimal 0.01 there are no points 0 decimal one
hold up for me the item on your table if this is one what a deci unit now looks like if this is the one hold up your deci unit
because it takes how many of those to make one of these yes you re positive yes really yes i don t know you don t sound that positive
here why yu for cm centimeters what about them easy easy
10 1000
100 so it takes 100 centi units to one whole unit
what is the fraction for one excuse me not the fraction the decimal for one over 100 one 0 decimal one show me your centi piece
what piece on your desk right now is a centi k that is a centi wrong you look confused are you okay one yes
milli are we on the bottom page multiple students yes you are all messed up you skipped a page somewhere
you may have a new one but not right now so just follow along
i ll give you my all right new page when i was growing up and i was just a dumb kid you re not dumb when i was a dumb kid
dumb i used to think see because back in the dark ages before television was actually in color and we only had 4 channels we had channel 13 channel 10 channel 3 channel 15 that was it
and i being the young child was the remote control what about no it was 3 10 13 15 that s it then how do you know what about 17 espn none of that no cable
school anyhow i used to think that milli meant a 1000000
how many milli units is it going to take to make a base unit 11 what 1000000 it s not a 1000000
10000000 1000 milli units equals one base unit so we ve got one over a 1000 number i haven t heard from you all day
0.001 0.001
please sit down please sit down please sit down we re going to practice now
lucky us we need to convert this will work for you we re going to have to convert in line across the units
open to page 239
so that s why i ve given you this number line so we can do jumps on the number line so we can figure . is giving me this look like i have no idea what you re talking about that s why it s called teaching so we can get there
let s look at number one on page 239 what measurement are we given we are given how many
one we re given one kiloliter what do i have to find find look at number one on page 239 what do i have to convert to
liters liters liters are our base unit yes yes yes
hand your right hand hand with your right hand i want you to point your pointer finger up i want you to take your pointer finger and i want you to push the button behind your ear and turn the thinking brain back on
push the on button i can see everybody turn the on button on now please take your hands off my card it s not there for your personal playing around
if i am going from one kiloliter to one liter what do i have to multiply by to get to the base unit 1000 multiply by 1000
cute cameras you know what
me okay number 2 number 2 says i have what do i have for number 2
1000 well here we don t even need to divide we don t need to even divide because we are uber geniuses how many zeros are in 1003123
put your decimal point between the one and the 5 you have one and 5 tenths liters because we are uber geniuses and you know miss g likes the shortcuts and the easy things
albert einstein said why memorize anything you can look up in a book albert einstein one of the greatest minds of the 20th century how do you even know this stuff i have a brain full of absolutely useless knowledge i have a brain full of trivia
so number 3 why are you not writing anything down
say liters 3000 liters wait a minute i m in the wrong file 3000 liters and what are we converting to
kiloliters one 2 3 jumps one 2 3 zeros have 33 super dupers
your job is to do 4 5 and 6 on your own now listen look at me this is silent math time meaning you can t speak
neighbor when you finish i need a thumb up and once everybody has a thumb up we ll go over the answers
how did you get 5.5 liters from i said 5 liters where are you getting 5 liters from
how many of you are having issues with number 4 okay
this is just moving up and down a decimal number line
i have 4.5 of these am i going to have more than 4 of these or less than 4 of these in here
more more so to get more do i multiply or do i divide multiply i multiply
1000 so 4.5 times 1000 there s 102 zeros 3 zeros 4500
and no freaking out at the number of problems on this page because you re not going to have to do them all has got the bucket
all right your assignment what s today s date today is the 9th of february your assignment is to complete the odd problems only them all of the odd problems
girls we re ready to begin our math lesson so i need all eyes up here quiet that s not important right now so have a seat thank you
all right our ability focus for today is we re going to multiply multi digit numbers by means of 2 methods just like we did earlier in the week with 2 digits times 2 digits today we re going to do 3 digits times 2 digits
and again you can use anyone of those methods over there to help you get your answer that so i want you to name the method and i want you to do it now watch me
problem 574 times 26
ways so i m going to use there was no method so i m going to label it as original this i m going to write this number going vertically
574 times 26 i m going to take the 6 in the ones place and multiply it times 574 time so 6 times 4 i know is 24
i write my 4 down and carry my 2 now i m going to multiply the 6 times the 76 times 7 is 42 +2 more is 44 so i put my 4 down and carry my 4 now i m going to take this 6 times 56 times 5 is 30 +4 more gives me 34
so 574 times 6 equals 3044 now i m going to take 574 times this 2 but this 2 you messed up i did it should be sorry i forgot the 4 thank you this 2 is in the 10s place so it has a value of 20
holder since this is in the 10s place i need to start my in the 10s place so i m going to add a 0 for a place holder that will start my answer in the 10s place so this 2 times this 4 is 8 this 2 times this 7 is 14 put down my 4 and carry my one
this 2 times this 5 is 10 +one more makes 11 these i take my 2 quotient products 3444 +11480 so i add 4 +0 is 44 +8 is 12
carry the 14 +4 is 8 +one more is 91 +3 is 4 and one plus nothing is one 14924 so this is one way method i m going to use the box
method i m going to set my box up i have 3 columns on the top and 2 columns on the side or 2 rows on the side when i do my box method i m just using the place values
so again i need 3 columns on the top 123 and i need 2 columns on the side that so right here this 5 has a value of 500
this 7 has a value of 70 because it s in the 10s place and this 4 has a value of 4 because it s in the ones place this 2 has a value of 20 it s in the 10s place this 6 has a value of 6 because it s in the ones place so these are what i m going to multiply i ll multiply what s on the outside of the boxes
so if i put my finger right here i see 500 on the top and 6 on the outside so i m going to multiply 6 times 500 remember i was teaching you about multiples of 10
here i can just do 6 times 5 and that s 30 so i write 30 right there and i get 3000 box i see 70 on top and 20 on the outside
i know 2 zeros so i see 2 zeros 12 i have 2 zeros and i multiply 7 times 2 and get 14 1400 i m going to pick this box right here see 500 on top 20 on the outside
i m going to count my zeros 123 i see 3 zeros 123 now i can multiply 2 times 5 and i get 10
10000 this box 7 is on top 6 on the bottom i see 10 in the problem my 0 and 7 times 6 gives me 42 so 70 times 6 gives me 420 this box 4 on top 20 on the outside
i see a 0 right here 4 times 2 is 8 so 4 times 20 equals 8 now my last box outside 4 times 6 is 24 and i don t see any zeros
up so when i add them i m going to write my numbers down and it s very important i keep my place values lined up
2000 +3000 +1400 +420 +80 +24
up there s all these zeros plus a 4 so that s a 40002 +8 is 10 +2 more is 12 my 2 and my one let s see 4 +4 is 8 +one more that i carried is 9 and i see one +3 is 4 and one plus nothing is one
and if i did this correctly my 2 products should match let s see 14924 here 14924 here questions all right so we re ready for a redo
book okay so here is your problem
you re going to do 287 times 38
i want to see 2 ways
once you have your product raise your hand and i ll com by and stamp it
i want you to label it both ways 2 different ways 03 how many is in your 2nd number 2 what s 3 times 2
3 times 2 is 99 try again 183 times 203 times 2
see use the original method and maybe use a placeholder if the 3 is in the 10s place you have to start your answer in the 10s place
got your answer yep job since you re waiting make up your own problem and i ll check it
good job i see some really good work i see some lattice some boxes and i see some original methods
job keep going
how did you get 61 do i see 6000 so you need a 0 up here make your numbers clearer
remember your place value if this is your ones place it s in your ones place
place which method works best for you
okay try that when you re done just raise your hand
we have a few seconds remaining
i m going to use equity sticks i m going to call one person to do one way and another person to do another way and because of time we can use the space right here
so someone can do one way on this space right here you can use this board and
she has the correct product
what did you just do
what s 3 times 8 stop
i want you to talk about what you did
8 times 7 was 56
i put down 56
explain what you did
good job product yes any questions about what you did wrong do you have any questions
steps what do you mean these steps
like how do okay with partial products what she s really doing watch i ll draw mine we got 56 doing 8 times 7
56 we did 8 times 7 and get 56
80 she took this 8 times 80 it s in the 10s place then she did this 8 times this 2 this was by 200 so this is 8 times 200 and she got 1600 this this 3 has a value of 30
it s in the 10s place so she did 3 times 7 i m sorry 30 times 7 then she did 30 times 80 place the last one she did she did 30 times 200
place then she added these up her partial products
8 times 7 is 568 times 8 is 640 1600 30 times 7 is 210 30 times 80 is 2400
and then she did 30 times 200 is 6000
down you need to know these words to be successful in today s lesson sum sum sum is the answer to an addition problem quickly we have sum
the next word say whole number whole number whole numbers are your counting numbers and 0 so i say count and you say 1234 and so on the last word is estimate say estimate
estimate and estimate we re going to estimate today and that means to round to the nearest whole number for this lesson number we do it to add numbers quickly and it s a best guess so when i say estimate today s lesson round to the nearest whole number which is one of these numbers
answers i want to hear what the sum is or i want to see a rounded such and such to get this whole number
all right now pay attention this is our attention point for today it says mathematicians use smart estimates before adding decimals what do you think this means
s i think it means good job work so we re going to use estimates to see the way our numbers should be
we estimate numbers it s going to give you when you estimate by decimals you make them into whole numbers sum the sum will be very very close to if you actually add them so it s going to be a best guess so that when you do add it if the number is not close to what your estimate was you know something s wrong
this can someone tell me why this is important
why is it important to learn this skill
t when you have money and like $2 good
so she s talking about money day when i go to the grocery store sometimes it s hard to add all the prices in my head but if i round it to the nearest whole number i have a ballpark figure on how much i m going to spend so when i get to the cash register i should have about that much money i don t want to be surprised that it s a lot more than i thought it was going to be
so this is why we use this skill or one reason why we use this skill watch the problem is jerome went to the store to purchase eggs milk and bread
the cost for the items was one.79 $3.23 and $2
what is the sum of the 3 items so we re going to start we re going to estimate 1st we re going to use smart estimates
 one.79 which whole number is that close to one.79 i know my whole numbers are my 1st whole number is going to be one and my next whole number is going to be 2
2 we re going to estimate this one.79 is close to the whole number 22 i m going to write a 2 right here
now $3.23 it s going to be between 2 whole numbers
we re going to do actual sums i m going to do the actual sum and i m going to add these i want to see if my answer is around $7 wrong my answer should be around $7
this i have one.79 and we re going to follow our steps
remember the steps on the board over there how we add decimals 1st of all we need to make sure each number is a decimal they are decimals then we ve got to make sure we ve got a decimal and write the numbers right up underneath it
the numbers need to line up number the next number is $2
now i m going to add one +7 is 8 +2 more is 10
down one +one is 2 +3 more is 52 more is 7 so we ll add the numbers up and i get the sum of $7.02 $7 yes it s very close to it so this is a good smart estimate
now we re going to use a model i m going to let these represent the tenths place
this is going to represent my hundredths place so hundredths tenths and the ones
for example if i have one.11 this would be the whole number which is one i ll make it one.23
one the 2 longs will be my tenths place 110th 2 tenths this will be one.20 and this will be my hundredths place
pennies in other words these are the pennies which are the hundredths this would be your dimes which is your tenths and these would be your ones or the ones place you understand we re going to use the same numbers
these are ones tenths hundredths one.79 i have one here how many tenths do i need for one.79
them this is 10 20 ¢30 ¢40 ¢60 ¢70 how many hundredths do i need good job i need 9 i need 9 of them
3 this is 456789
 one.79 i have one flat 7 longs and 9 now the 2nd number how many ones do i need for the 2nd value and how many ones do i need 3
3 so 123 how many tenths do i need
i need 2 and i need 31s for the last number how many ones do i need 2 i need 2
do i need any tenths no no so this is all i need i m going to want to start with the one with the least amount the one with the least amount is my hundredths place i m going to get 10 of them if you have 10 or more you trade up to the next value
them 2468 10 so i have to trade these 10 for the next value which what s higher than hundredths tenths is the higher value thousandths is lower
so i m going to take these 10 hundredths and trade them for 110th
that s another one what do we have to do
trade them for a whole or a one
i have 71s and ¢0 so it s $7.02 now what do we do
smart estimate smart estimate model
you should learn them i don t know how to do those
okay we re going to go through and check your homework real quick before we start our lesson for today
yesterday we were talking about decimal patterns in decimal division so what did you get on problem number one for your answer by 5 i m sorry 15 and one and 5 tenths one and 5 tenths very good
l 223rd 22 and 2 tenths good job k 44 and 4 tenths very good
patterns which way is your decimal moving when you divide in this pattern c 2513rd let s look at that again what s the what would have been a 100 divided by 4
i know the answer for okay go ahead it s 25 and 2 and 5 tenths and 25 hundredths very good 252 and 5 tenths and 25 hundredths what about number 5208 good job
u 255 tenths very nice going onto 7 your rule on number 7 was to divide by 20 so what did you get for your answers 17 i can t hear you
550 . 5 tenths good job what about then when you on number 8 when you divided by 90 the output was 40600 and for the i put tenths 60 good very good 9
when you divided by 6 . the output was 5550 and 5 tenths and the input was 30 very good multiplication so they wanted you to write some checked problems for 1011 and 12 what did you put on 10
i didn t do it now look at that 40 divided by 5 equals 8 what would be your multiplication problem that you could check that with 8 times 5 equals 40 j 8 tenths times 5 equals 4 very good
d 40 times 84 is 3200 good and then on the next 170 times 40 equals 70 oop what we re on number 11 we re on the 2nd part on number 111 times 80
equals 32 on 12 what did you get i got 40 times 70 equals 28000 not 28000 it s 2800 and i got 40 times . 40 times 7 tenths equals 28
great 13 it says how long will it take to make all the bows what did you get 720 nope how many minutes 120 nope not 120 it says has to make 120 bows she can make 6 bows in 10 minutes
how long will it take to make all of the bows so she makes 6 bows in 10 minutes now she needs to make all the bows t she makes 6 bows each 36 in 10 minutes
make 12120 so she s trying to make 120 bows ooh i know so if you if 6 bows equals 10 minutes if i said 12 bows 12 bows is going to be 2020
minutes and if i said 181818 bows it s going to be 3030 minutes see
6 times 16 times 26 times 3 if i said 20 what comes next bows 40 minutes 40 minutes but i ve got to get to here s my number
minutes how many times does 6 go into 12120 divided by 62020 so if i jump ahead say i started with 6 times one
times 5552020 because 6 times 2020 times 6 equals 12120 so if i jump ahead and say 6 times 20 i get 120 then how many minutes 20200 minutes
14 sid earned $60 a week week how much does he earn per hour what do you think
okay all right everybody should be on page 172 because we re going to be focusing on decimal division we re going to be focusing on on your models
workbooks making models and . how to understand and read those models read what read where it says in the middle of page 172 your math idea division of decimals okay a model can help you to visualize division of decimals
so our sample problem is going to be who would like to say this number for me
s one and 5 tenths one and 5 tenths divided by 3 this is going to be our sample problem we re going to work with
so if you look at this on your board i want you to make i want you to demonstrate one and 5 tenths actually let s do this
i want you to put one . one white board in the center of your group right now flat on the table listen and we re going to make this actually put 2 white boards together
just put 2 white boards together it doesn t matter back just so you can work together as a group
shh how many strips would you say are in a base 10 block if you have one of those . how many many like how many of these are called your what
j huh columns but they are columns but they are called your tenths tenths strips so there s 10 so you have 10 going across
12345678 there s 10 okay right now i want you so and if you have one completely shaded that s considered what whole if i were to have 3 shaded that would be what 3 tenths if i were to have 7 shaded that would be what
8 if i would have 7 shaded that would be okay we re not drawing it on our boards 0 okay if you have one whole shaded that s what if i have this whole thing shaded that s considered what
whole right now i want you now before i go a step further and if i were going to cut these into little squares these little squares are referred to as your what hundredths hundredths and how many of them how many do you have total on a board
i a 100 a 100 so 2391045678900 got it a little off on that okay what i want you to do
i want you to show and you re going to work on it as a group with your tiles i want you to make one and 5 tenths one and 5 tenths and you can use your book to help you if you need to
group i want that s going to be your 1st step help i need you to stop what you were what are you doing okay okay well put that up but . you got to help put them together
how many are you going to need to make one and 5 tenths huh a 150 how many are you going to need
you need to be 15 just a 100 we re making one and 5 tenths we need 15151515 how many are you going to need me and as you re making it separate look separate your columns like this that s wrong separate them
bit 0 in columns not rows you got some of the i need these who did those come out of a ziploc i found them who got these for your group i did you did separate but you can use them that s fine but i want you to keep them separate
total one whole do i put one whole for 15 because you re going to need 10 and no we re not using our marker 0 boys and girls who can i think this group back here need little tiles are you going to need total
a 150 a 150 because how many of these little tiles make up one of one whole
k a 100 and then we re doing 5 tenths so you re going to need i know
one color yeah make sure you only have 10 in each row one actually here this if we re going to do we have enough no
do we have these 0 well there s some more right here so yeah we have enough where s your all right go back there come on here put these together boys
you got to just we got to put them together 5 tenths and then 13rd you got to make your whole 1st 12345678910 this is 110th you need to make 5 of them well you need to make not well to make a half yes
yeah but we need 5 tenths to well come on why are we all stopped
we already made one whole okay and are you all going to have enough yeah 678910
1112 okay okay we have a bunch of extra hands up
up now this is what you need to do i do have one and 5 tenths made with your tiles i m going to wait until you re all listening you could i want you to take you re going to need to divide those
how many total tiles is that 1st of all one and 5 tenths 50 because look you have that s not a good marker you have this one all shaded as one whole how many how much of this one do you have shaded
55512345 so you have 5 of this one if you had you have 150 little what these would be called your what raise your hand
hundredths hundredths if you had the strips if each of these were considered like as all of your 10 little blocks together considered as one strip how many strips would you have total because your strips are called your what your strips are called your what tenths so if you were dealing just with tenths you would have how many strips
1515 so you have 1510th strips or 150 . hundredths right now what are you dividing them by
what 3 tenths i mean 3 just 3 so now with those tiles i want you take 3 different whit boards and you can use them i m going to wait until you re ready when you divide this group right here is not ready
you re not listening so you re going to take your 150 little 100th tile pieces and you re going to divide them into 3 equal groups 3 equal groups so why don t you take 3 different white boards and then you need to what do you need to do
you re going to need to put the same number in each group right yeah so before you go and mess them all up you need to figure out how many need to be in each group why are you taking this all away because you re not you all need to be working to here
me you need to be working together as a group
12345 so you have that would be like 50 hundredths or 5 tenths 5 tenths we do that okay so now you need if you put together 150 of these how many need to be in each group 5 tenths or 50 so that s what you need to make right now
451234 all right this group has it right here
there 50 or 5 tenths we don t need any more all right hands up job this group really just your whole collaboration and working together job this group right here s doing a nice job
3 so you had like . 3 different groups and they had to have the same number in each group group 5050 you had 50 little squares tiles hundredths hundredths or if we re talking tenths you had how many
55 tenths you either had 5 tenths in each group if you re talking 10th strips or in hundredths you had how many 5050 hundredths since we re working with the little tiles you had 50 hundredths in each group so you had 50 little pieces 6
on so you had 50 little pieces in each group so what would you say your answer is 3 and if we re going to answer it in tenths and not hundredths what would my answer be
m 50 i mean 5 if we re answering it in tenths 0 k 5 tenths 5 tenths is also equal to what
hundredths 50 hundredths it s also equals to 50 hundredths okay one put all of your pieces back together in the same bowl
wait just leave them just where you are and let me just give you a new problem here s your new problem 30 here s your new problem read this new problem for me
100 divided by 2 equals blank n so how many little pieces do you need 230 right 30 hands up
attention boys you need to be listening your question is 30 hundredths divided by 2 so i need to start off with how many altogether how many . how many little hundredths pieces do i need
n 30 i only need 30 of them so i m going to start with only 30 hundredths on one white board away you need to make how many are you making over here 3030 all right let s push these over here for a minute
let s turn around and be a part of your group up
yes okay once you listen how many do you where s you 30 hundredths okay that up how many groups do you have to divide that 30 into
i 2 so you take those 30 hundredths and put them into 2 groups equal groups how many groups are you going to make 22 but they have to have an equal number in each group so you re taking your 30 hundredths so you re going to break them into 2 groups meaning you re going to have here s going to be this is going to go away right here
this is going to be one group this is going to be another group how many are going to be equal in there 3 you have 30 no these are your 30 right please stop put those down you ve got to take this 30 right here and divide it into 2 separate groups
groups to be 15 hundredths okay so then you need to put 15 here and how many go here
how many do you have in each group 1515 hundredths hundredths very good pieces how many did you say are in each group good okay hands up
what hundredths hundredths hundredths are in each group so 30 divided by 230 hundredths divided by 2 equals n to 601515 what hundredths hundredths all right let s try one more
make it big read this problem for me
attention read this hundredths divided by 312 hundredths divided by 3 equals n so you need to figure out what n is equal to with how many little hundredths are you going to start off with
1212 so you only need how many 12 hundredths turn around participating 0 wow
answer listen what s your answer hundredths very good what s your answer i mean 4 but what s your answer 3 i mean 4 if you re dividing by 3 now you ve done you have 12 divided into 4 groups you have to have how many groups do you you only can have 3
no do we measure the same thing with yards what do i have to know about yards in order to figure that out how many yards are in what a foot how many yards in a foot which one is bigger foot yard
yard i have to know how many feet feet in in a yard one yard
yard this is yard
yard how many inches in one foot 36 no that is 36 inches in one yard
32 think of a ruler foot about how big is a ruler 12 very good 12 inches in one foot
so how many groups of 12 are in that yardstick shhh how many 12 is how many groups of 12
3 feet in one yard how many feet in 2 yards now 6 feet 6 feet very good very good now i should remember be able to remember that better by doing that that way having a picture of it and figuring it out teacher i am not talking to people who are just calling out at me
thank you 2 yards is equivalent to 6 feet
that because when you put the ruler you have to see how many 12 is were in the ruler and then it was 33
this an inch no what do we call this yardstick so we wanted to see how many feet were in this yardstick right 12 is the number of 12s to figure it out
yard 33 there are 3 12s in this yard yes so yes for 2 yards yeah one yard is 3 be 99 there you go
yes and then number 5
e while he is doing that i am going to be passing out something do not open them yet
unfortunately i do not know where my other stuff i know some of my other sets are missing
them they are hot potatoes 78 divided by 9
9 times what gives us a number near 78
yeah how much is 9 times 8
71 put that away you need to sit up it and that needed to be corrected
picking on you shhh what is 9 times 8
8 72
72 i think you need to redo this
this and where is this you were with us
61 9 times what gives us a number close to 61 but not more than 61
9 times what gives you 54
away you may now take out your cuisenaire rods and arrange them in order
times you do not need to play with them right now
them 61 take away 54 is 7
see i like those of you that have arranged them in staircase order
flat you have one minute to do this or i will take these from you
as soon as you have put them in a staircase put the rest of them to the side to and then look at the number line that you were given aside thank you
put your number line directly in front of you i got 6 again honey 11 take away 4 is 7
side you are to use them but you need to refer back to your staircase there is one of each in a staircase one of each
them teacher put this away please shhh one each the rest go just in a little pile me this is fine so let us just put it over here now i want you to do this
if you look at your number line find the point that says one
whole one whole now using your orange rod put that on the 0
go now i want you to find out how much more you need to equal one whole
put the orange right here
orange right on that orange line right there it is the red
that how many is that 0 start at the 0
shhh if we know that 10 is equal i mean orange is equal to one whole we are doing differently right now we know orange is equal to one half when we did the orange how many white did the orange equal 10
10 now what else did you have to put at the end of that to get to the whole how many is that equal to 22 now we are doing this so that we can divide this up and get some good fractions
mind here is 12 i want you to find one half of the whole looking at your staircase that is why you have it so you have an idea of which one equals one half
it one half of a one whole yellow one half of that whole yellow yes it is not yellow it is half of one yes green green takes 2 green
so i want you to mark that halfway and write one half mark guys do the marking dark green honey dark green mark
mark underneath dark green good be exact green that is why we are doing this for 12
exact that is why we are basing this on 12 where is your dark green that you made the half mark with half are not you going to put a red in
one where is the half 2 where is the halfway point between these 2 right here yes and then draw the line and write one half shhh and i need everybody is attention
stop if this is one half and we are still thinking about halves how much is this one half no half so now a whole and how many halves equals one whole
right yeah then if i go one more half how many halves do i have 33 halves please find that exact 3 halves point
that shhh between one and 2 find 3 halves no between one and 2 find 3 halves i found it 20
where is the mark between one whole and 2 half right there there is the whole exact we are going to use to mark it exact
go now mark the one half or 3 halves point mark the 3 halves point no no if this is one half you are going to go from the one 2 there with what yes
it 3 halves 3 halves this is 2 halves 3 halves right there it shhh 3 halves 3 halves have you looked up here
whole thank you 3 halves thank you good is this exact right yeah where is 3 halves
0 the half of that one
this is 2 halves i want 3 halves show me 3 halves i do not have any more 33 halves 3 halves is more than one whole no you are not listening to me
this is 2 halves one half 2 halves now where is 3 halves whole where is 3 halves 3 halves why are you putting your purple one did you say you got to go past
0 i was starting i see it there now where is 3 halves put the one half on the end of the 2
go where is 3 halves where is the half where is 2 halves no that is one half
half now show me 2 halves where would 2 halves go one half +one half you do not need this anymore is that 2 halves that is one half shhh is that exact or you just eyeballed that
shhh now where is 3 halves there is 2 halves no no no 2 halves we need to put one more half here
does a fraction have to be part of one whole no no it can be more than one whole can not it wholes and we are showing that right now
box so if i have a whole and a half how would i write that
that one and one half shhh i put one and one half one and one half i am going to put
now we are going to do the same thing with purple wait a minute no wait a minute this is right here half so this would be let me see if i am doing this right
purple it is green green light green light green light green what fraction is light green one half no
14th 14th freeze moment freeze some of you are still playing instead of paying attention you were told to take the light green out
i should not see anything else right now in your hands but the light green
it shhh do not now if i put another light green on there what do i have one half one half or 14th 2 fourths 2 fourths 2 fourths that is our equivalent to 14th are we writing this down
writing no you must be exact on shhh you must mark when we mark some of you are staring up here like you do not have a thing to do
it this is what i should see right now but use your cuisenaire rods to make the lines 14th 4th then 2 fourths put one more light green on
get 33 fourths oops wrong place 3 fourths but i want you to use your green rods
no use your green rods to mark this here we go honey the end is here not there go show me the end of this line
end of this line no the end of this line here there so if it starts right here where is 14th
right here right there let me see what you are doing you got a lot of these stuff 14th 2 fourths 3 fourths how many fourths now
half you are starting from here exact shhh let us put this aside for right now
2 fourths 3 fourths now what is this 14 fourths 4 fourths then what is this 15 fourths continue labeling your fourths all the way to the whole number 2
2 keep going honey i am not sure here we are going from this line here
that is 14th one half 2 fourths you are going to make them exact please shhh finish i finished with the fourths right here no you did not
say then pick them up and do like we do with the ruler go it has to be here
this 14th 2 fourths 3 fourths this is one right here here that is one and then 5 fourths 6 fourths 7 fourths good just fix this this is one right there shhh very good
that 8 fourths 8 fourths where would you put 8 fourths shhh you are just a little off right there
there 8 fourths where are 8 fourths honey which one is fourths yes there is your fourths shhh 4 fourths what is this one
huh no that is improper fraction it is under the whole 14th 2 fourths 2 fourths which is equivalent to one half
3 fourths so this would be how many fourths 4 fourths 4 fourths which is also one so this would be how many fourths this is 4 fourths how many fourths is this 55 fourths fix it
keep going so the answer for this would be 2 wholes honey we are not working with fifths this whole is 2 halves and it is how many fourths 2
it is 14th wait here 14th 2 fourths 3 fourths then it is there is your whole right here
off and then how many fourths one wait 4 this is 4 fourths this is 4 no this is 4 fourths we are doing 41 whole this is 4 fourths or one whole
4th how many fourths do we have in math 4 fourths +14th is how many fourths 55 fourths then we have how many 6
go label those get you an eraser shhh where are your fourths do you have an eraser no where are your fourths freeze freeze i am seeing 2 halves all over the place
what one whole one whole 2 halves one whole 2 halves equivalent to one whole fix it
the fold in your paper is i just lost it there everybody look
shhh the fold in your paper is equivalent to one
no stop being a smart aleck if this is one it is also 2 halves and it is also one whole 4 fourths 4 fourths 4 fourths what do we know about a whole
it takes if it is the same numerator and denominator it is one now we have to keep counting by 4s
if this is 4 fourths this is 5 fourths 5 fourths nobody should have their hands on anything but eyes up here done so then this would be be 7 fourths 7 fourths and then this would be
8 fourths 8 fourths now we do not have the same numerator as denominator but we know that we could divide the numerator by the denominator
be 4 fourths 44 halves what are you doing
there thank you thank you very much shhh where is 14th here is 14th right here write 14th then you would need your fourths here
is want to tell me again cause i heard you the 1st time
it this is 3 fourths right here one is the same as 2 halves it is your eraser thanks where are your 8 fourths i want improper fractions there is a reason for that
honey if this is one then this would be one and 14th right here or 5 fourths fix it
p to practice our mixed numbers and improper fractions right and also why do i have you using the cuisenaire rods to do it so that when we have our homework or a sheet to do and it has these things on it we can at least know what they look like and how much they are and what the good
so you have a visual picture of half 3 fourths 5 fourths so you know what it looks like in relationship to whole number cause some of you are very confused about what it means when we go from improper fractions and mixed number and vice versa
fraction now you have a picture of it card this is why we are doing this so you get an understanding of what we are doing
bag we are continuing to play while i am talking we going to have a worksheet on this for homework yes you are going to have something on this we can take this yes take a seat now
but another reason i chose cuisenaire rods is because you can use them to divide this up a lot i want you to find the rod that is 13rd 13rd
and the other thing is this is 0 but your line goes like this here that is not where we are starting point that is why it is labeled 0 so we know where to start
13rd 13rd of this the other one there 13rd shhh 13rd no
that is not 13rd find 3 of them that will give you the 1st whole whole remember orange is not the 1st whole
what was the 1st whole green yes
shhh and then there was and those 2 are whole so tell me 13rd of one whole
staircase it has to be equal each section must be equal with the same rod
okay so now what i am going to do you have the bingo sheets on your board cubes now i am going to pass out the number sheet where you are going to choose the numbers like i said
you just pick one and write it then check it and keep picking until your whole board is filled up with numbers so this middle one if you look at the n column and you count 3 squares down the one in the middle who can tell me what that space is going to be space so you can write the word free in the middle one
now i am going to pass out these so you can start writing the numbers now if you would rather have my help like last time we played this if you would rather me call out the numbers and then you write it somewhere i will do that too for those that this just confuses you those that know what you are doing you can go ahead and write in the numbers as soon as you get this
those that want to wait just wait and i will call out numbers and you can write them in whatever square you want okay if you know what you are doing you can go ahead and get started and you know who you are wait the quicker we fill in the numbers the quicker we can get to the game
remember there is 30 numbers but you only have 24 squares you are filling in me okay yes what do we need this paper for we are going to work out problems
problems so when i give you a problem and we solve it using your scratch paper that is how we are going to see what number we need to mark on our board i copied this and put it right here you do not have to
would not just pick randomly and then put them anywhere order like i said there is one 2 3 4 5 6 and you only have one 2 3 4 5 okay randomly everybody is board is going to be different and that is the whole point
if you have the same board as somebody else that means there is going to be 2 winners okay you have got to make sure you are using the numbers on here on the sheet that i gave you if you are not you might want to go back and check so you do not have one number twice
that is the whole point of me giving you the sheet with the numbers rather than putting them up here on the projector know you had to keep looking at your board before you wrote a number to see if you already had it now you can cross them out or check them once you know you have got it
it get what you are doing okay
now the quicker you fill in your board the more time we have to play it should be a little easier to fill in your board now since you have all the numbers right there with you rather than having to look up at the projector
so like i said it is very important that you are writing the numbers that are on the sheet if you are writing numbers that are not even on there then you are not going to have any that you are going to be able to put markers on number i see some people are already finished
anywhere do not really have to think about it just pick and write also just a reminder you are not going to use all of the numbers
use can we take out a free space to fill just one more number there i would not space if you put a number where the free space is it is going to be harder for you to get if you get one diagonal it is going to be harder for you to get that number
the chances of you getting that number is very low if you have a free space here all you have to get is 4 numbers in any way i want to put another number no just do a free space if you put a number in a free space your likelihood of winning is going to be very small
now so it looks like almost everybody we are just about finished
the 1st few i will go through and go through with you if i need to refresh some of your brains on how to do this but like i said we have been doing this stuff with challenges and weekly sheets today our 1st one our 1st problem is 17 times 13
all right 17 times 131s we are staring with 3 times 7 is 21 so i put the one and 21 in the ones place
2 3 times one is 3 5 then my big step before i move to this one is i put a 0 one times 7 is 7 and one times one is one so now i add them together to get the answer 7 +5 is 12
221 look on your board to see if you have that 221 yes do we mark the free space you can go ahead and mark the free space now remember the markers remember problems we had last time was that the markers slid sometimes
when somebody says they have bingo sometimes there would be one number i had not done it is very important that you try your best not to make your board move so that those markers do not move okay so that is 17 times 13 221
division it is 464 divided by 8 i am going to make my bar make my house i put the big number under the house and the 8 is our divisor so the big number is our dividend and the 8 is our divisor i look at the 1st number under the house which is a 4
if i have 4 cubes how many groups of 8 can i make if i only have 4 cubes here if you remember our acronym that showed us does mcdonald is serve burgers divided 4 divided by 8 is 0
multiply who can raise their hand and tell me what 2 numbers we are multiplying help when we get to these different steps you do not know what to do remember practice is going to take to fix that so you can remember 8 so the top number on the house times the number on the side of the house
0 times 8 is 0 subtract 4 -0 is 4 now i bring down the 6 which is the next number inside my house 46 now i have 46 cubes 8 times what is going to get us closest to 46
5 okay all right now we divide it 5 now what we are doing is we are going to multiply to see what our remainder is how many cubes we have leftover 5 times 8 is 40 now i subtract i have got 6
now i have one number left that i need to bring all the way down so 64 remainder 8 times what is 64 right i still need to multiply because i am not done until i know for sure that i do not have a remainder
64 so i subtract 0 0 on your board you need to look for the number 58
i need to fix mine i put 582 times you need to pick another number that you have not done
solve all right 12 times 18 is our next one do
16 okay and 8 times one equals 8 +one equals 9 put the 0 under the 6 one times 2 equals 22 remember sometimes it is pretty tricky especially when we are regrouping
you have got to remember to do it with a step when you had to regroup for instance when i move to one one times one is one but i remember i do not need to add this one on top because i did that with when i did 8 times 2 is 16
one just because there is a number on top where you regrouped that does not mean you add it every single time you get to the 10s okay what we did was we crossed out that number if that is going to confuse you it is a good strategy to cross out the number you regrouped once you are done with it
i have got a number right here you have got to erase one and look at one on your sheet to see one you have not used all right we need to i only need one more so we need to add these together 11 so 216 is our answer
216 all right 234 divided by 6
6 before i get somebody to show me how to do this one i am going to show you a different way strategy when our 1st number is smaller than our divisor i know right now the 2 i know if i have 2 cubes i can not make a group of 6
what i am going to do to save time is i am going to skip that process where i put a 0 up here i am going to look at the 2 and the 3 and that is going to save me that time okay so instead of just looking at a 2 i already know i can not make a group of 6 with 2 cubes 3 i am looking at the number 23
so 6 times what will get us closest to 23 3 okay so i am going to go ahead and put a 3 above the ones place in 23 because 3 is a ones number and a 3 in the 23 is in the ones place
3 i am going to multiply who can tell me what i am going to multiply g 3 times 6
18 all right so 18 the strategy i am going to use rather than having to regroup and do all that i am just going to take 18 and count up until i get to 23 23 okay
5 okay are we just supposed to be writing the thing down or are you supposed to solve it by yourself either one me if you do not you can do it on your own and check to see if you are right with me once we are done right now i am going to bring down the 4 because that is our next step in our acronym 54 this one is also going to come out even with no remainder
6 times 9 is 54 but i still need to multiply just to make sure that i am finished so 9 times 6 is 54 done 39 is the answer
board all right 242
low 242 times 8 step we just have that one step where we are multiplying the 81st 8 times 2 then 8 times 4 then 8 times 2 we do not have 2 levels with this one like we usually do with a big step
one we are just multiplying one number by the other there is regrouping so you have got to make sure you are doing that correctly together 8 times 2 is what is 8 +8 16 so i put the 6 in 16 on the bottom
one all right then 8 times 4 you got a question or you want to help me 8 times 4 is 32 but i have got to add the one so 33
regrouping so i am putting the 3 on the bottom and i need to put that other 3 in 33 on the top right 8 times 2 is 16 19 so 16 +3 is 19 that your final answer should be 1936
is there a problem 1936 all right
our next one is 64 times 30 all right so since this one has a 0 it is going to make our 1st multiplying pretty easy
this one remember you do have the big step since our 2nd number has 2 digits
step after you multiply 0 times 4 and 0 times 6 you have got to do that big step before you move to multiplying the 3
who has the answer what is the answer 1920 1920 yeah that is right me 0 times 4 i see you got most of it
i do not know if you got the right answer but i see you were on the right path okay so 0 times 4 is 0 there multiplying the ones place times these 2 now i make sure i do my big step and put that in the place of our ones since we are moving to the 10s all right
12 so my 2 is going to go here but i have got to carry my one over to the next column 18 then i have got to add my one
together since i have 0 here i know my answer is going to be 1920
all right our next one is 280 divided by 81 to save time i know when i have 2 cubes i am not going to be able to make a group of 8
28 now i need to divide if i have 28 cubes how many groups of 8 can i make 3 i can only make 3 then i will have some leftover multiply 3 times 8 is 24
24 okay so now i need to subtract 0 8 -4 is 4 now i need to bring down as my next step b stands for bring down
right this one is also going to come out even there is no remainder 8 times something equals 40 me out we need to follow through to all of our steps
multiply i am going to take that step multiply it by the 8 8 times 5 is 40 i need to subtract because s stands for subtract 0 i do not have any numbers i need to bring down so i am done
boards anybody close to getting bingo
yes all right our next one 218 times 70
digit multiplying a 0 that 1st step using the ones place to multiply should be easy it is always remembering once you finished doing 0 times 8 0 times one and 0 times 2 can not forget that big step
important you get the answer raise your hand and let me know 15760 you are very close digit
15260 yes so we will go through it it is 15260 it 0 times 8 is 0
do the big step i need to put a 0 since i am moving to the 10s i have got to put the 0 to take up the ones place okay if you forget to do that all your numbers are going to be shifted over then you will add them up and get the wrong answer
when you do 100s by 100s do you add 2 zeros after you get the 10s place you will need to do 2 zeros when you get to the 100s so 7 times 8 is 56 5 7 times one is 7 +5 is 12
one 7 times 2 is 14 +one is 15
remember i am not going to look at the 2 and do the whole process when i can just look at 29
it so everybody should be solving this 291 divided by 8 this hold on just a 2nd i am going to give people time to solve it
make 8 times what will get us closest to 29 5 8 times 5 is 40 so that is too big work i am going to put the 3 on top of the 9 because they are both in the ones place
3 times 8 is 24 multiply the next step s means to subtract one 8 times what is closest to 51 6 because 8 times 6 is 48
subtract i am just going to count up rather than regroup because it is very close 51 so the difference is just 3 me do you know what the 3 means if i have something left over
mean what does the 3 mean remainder 3 that is what you are looking for on your boards
i have it 2 times erase it and fill one in that you do not have
all right our next one is 16 times 15 it
can i say it yet wait
marker okay
all right so you did 5 times 6 is 30
one it is 5 number 5 +3 is 8 there do you know what we need to do here before we start multiplying a one times these numbers okay since we are moving to the 10s place we need to put the 0 in the ones place
one times 6 is 6 one okay we already did this so we can cross that out so it will not confuse us
adding all right 0 +0 8 +6
right so the answer is 241 you do not even have to do anything if you remember what i have taught you 16 times 10
what is something we can do where we do not even have to solve this one what do we need to do when we see something when we are multiplying a number by 10 or 100 or 1000 do you can just act like those zeros are not there so 16 times one equals 16 you just add the zeros yeah 16 times one is 16 and you just add however many zeros
bingo all right that one the answer is 160 on so look for 160 on your board yet remember we usually do it where we have a boy and a girl if gets bingo we will keep playing until a girl wins
what if another boy gets bingo no because it is the 1st boy and the 1st girl ahead guys you need to be quiet so i can hear is 58 160 free space 1936 and 35
bingo like i said do not clear your boards boys you can continue to play okay but it is always the 1st boy and the 1st girl who get a credit now we will keep playing until one of our girls gets bingo too all right if you got bingo at the same time then you can get a card
let me check is go ahead 15260 okay 160
okay 1936 240 so she got bingo
221 okay 160 216 okay and 240 game you guys got bingo pretty quick
usually it takes longer than this so maybe we will have time to get some more winners before it is time to line up for lunch
yes all right
start i said already clear your boards you do not erase your board is what quit we are going to go ahead and get started
guys i do not know if i can take away that lap or not because i have had to say get ready several times all right so our 1st one is this one is pretty tough 634 divided by 12
here okay it is very important to know your 12 times tables all right like i said i know if i have a group of 6 i can not make a group of 12
63 12 times what will get us closest to 63 5 5 because 12 times 5 is 60 close 12 times 5 is 60 subtract 6 -6 is 0
3 -0 is 3 down now i have 34 as my new number 12 times what will get us closest to 34 2 because 12 times 3 is 36
24 all right 3 times 2 is one 4 -4 is 0 i do not have any more numbers so this is my remainder 52 remainder 10
okay i know if i look at the 21st i am not going to be able to make a group 23 it will save me a whole step rather than having to go through all the steps twice i can just go through them once
it is okay we may repeat some of the ones we did right who can tell me 6 times what will get us closest to 23
23 6 times 4 6 times 4 is 24 so it is just a little bit over again 6 times 3 18 so 18 19 20 21 22 23
5 so i bring down the 5 even 9 so our answer is 39 if i do not see you working these out you are going to come up here and do it
it is very important that you guys need to be working these out with us i am going to look for those that need to come up on all right
414 times 10 know just add a 0 to this number
4140 it is right here 4140 extra lap for you
yes what if you accidentally put a number that is not there then erase it and put a number that is not there 68 times 46
6 times 8 is she taught me another way how you add 6 times that is what multiplication is
times it is the same way if you know your times tables you do not have to take that time to add it 8 times because that might take a while 48 6 times 6 is 36 +4 is 40
step 4 times 8 is 32 so 32 i have got to cross this out and put a 3 there
4 times 6 is 24 +3 is 27
up i am just going to call out the answers to save time all right everyone needs to be in their seat 216 we are not solving anymore
i am just calling out answers so we can get some winners because it is almost time to line up
33 i got bingo 36 he got bingo girl so you may go get a credit
here we go 8 bingo i need a girl now so guys you are kind of out since somebody won
266 36 remainder 3 bingo okay go ahead 41 if it is not quiet i am adding another lap
41 36 remainder 3 free space 41 remainder 8 and 33
yes all right so what i need to be done is if you will go out and get the cubes so take your sheets take your bingo sheets and put it in your folder
like i said to save time we might use these later you can take your number sheet and put it in the recycling bin along with your scratch paper
up once your trash your number sheet and your scratch paper are in the recycling bin you can line up
all right today we re going to be working on adding decimals grid we have been working on comparing decimals which are larger which are smaller
decimals so by the end of today you should know how to add decimals up on the board +ones that go to the hundredths we re starting with tenths
okay hands down if you ve finished if you went ahead as soon as you saw me and copied it on the board earlier that s great everybody should be working on this right now s if you re at the table over there you still need to be doing this breakfast time is done
this yes i need paper where s your math notebook i don t have it there go sit at the far desk over there s desk i suppose
already answered that question once i ll get situated over here and help you guys out and then i ll circulate to the other groups we don t need that right now
now how s it going get to work please so far i ve seen 12345 different answers
all right 30 more seconds
volunteers if you have different answers come up and show us how you got them then as a class we ll take a look and say what we think up let s get to it
up you were the 1st one to say you were done up ooh that s good all the more reason to bring it up to the board so we can discuss that
pencil we re working on a problem on the board later somebody s already got that one on the board
us you guys were a little bit late i know there were some problems this morning on the bus let s just curb those for now and we ll address them later okay you guys i ll be walking around checking on you so make sure you re paying attention to this and you ve got a different answer than other people
wonderful all right so i see a lot of .16
what s the difference between make sure you re facing the board the entire time how many people at your seats got .16 seats all right so walk us through this how did you get your answer
i did .2 plus .2 plus .2 plus .7 and .3 equals .9 plus one equals okay in trying to assess the 3 groups you took the 2 the 2 and the 2 the 6 and the 3 so you created smaller problems in that one
different can you step behind this and get this out of the way so you can point to it as you go seat just point right at this from the side stand more sideways so the camera can you see the camera between it
okay i know we re supposed to ignore the camera but we want the camera to be able to see what we re talking about
are you on your best behavior as always
begun it seems we re having a much easier time with this 2nd problem
thing if you still have one of my markers hold it up so i can grab it as i m walking around here
up 26312 and 2 show of hands did anyone line it up like this use okay similar so you did you piece it
here please stop the tapping you have to read nice and loud okay so you took combinations here 6 and 3 and one is 10 +6 all right the reason i want you to look at this is because we re all getting 16
for this 12 +6 +3 +one +2 +2 equals 16 16 you re right now tell me how to write 161 and 6 okay so i start with a one and a 6
silly the one is in the 10s place and the 6 that makes a lot of sense place yes no we usually write it from right to left right we normally say put the 6 carry the ones into the 10s place right why is it that when you guys reached 10 with a decimal point you didn t carry
did anyone notice when you went to .16 except for over here and i m going to make s larger
distracting we added these up and we got .16 anywhere on here do we see a hundredths place in our math problem no but somehow we ended up with a hundredths place in our answer sense if we re adding big pieces tenths pieces does it make sense in our answer we get hundredths pieces
there all right so some people regrouped this 10 so if you have .6 .3 and one what should this equal
.10 now right here one is a 10th this does this make sense when we re adding the numbers that our final answer is the same as one of our pieces no what would you normally do if these decimals weren t here do you would put a 0 and carry the one and add the one right
yes it s as simple as that you re doing the exact same math decimals work on the base 10 so when you get 10 tenths you create what create no a fraction that has the same numerator and denominator is creating what
10 tenths equals i know you know this 10 tenths equals what the fraction 10 over 10 10 tenths because we read this as 10 tenths right
when we added 6 tenths and 3 tenths and 110th we ended up with 10 tenths there one whole whole when you get to 10 you carry it over whole so the answer is not one whole because we still have our .2 .2 and .2
up .2 .2 and .2 is equal to what what 60.2 .2 and .2 is not going to be 60 tenths let s think back to when we were comparing decimals
let s do a quick review here of place value what is this place value everyone 100s say that again what s this place value 10s
10s what s this place value table let s try this again everyone please what value is this 10s 10th in other words it takes 0 of these to equal one of these
how many ones does it take to make a 10 this how many hundredths does it take to make a 10th
a 1000 a 100 if it takes 11s to make a 10 and 10 tenths to make a one how many hundredths to make a 10 pattern how many does it take
a 100 it does not take a 100 to make a 10th whole it would take 100 of these to make a 100th but the question is how many hundredths make a 10th
we said a row is equal or a column is equal to what and entire column is equal to what that what is that value 10th this whole thing is equal to a 10th
to not 11.0 no though 0 one so this is our 100th our 100th is one little square
our 10th is an entire column of those squares how many hundredths does it take to equal 110th
how many hundredths does it take to equal a 10th 10th 10 so this is a bonus
one you guys only need to have a solid solid tenths hundredths they say a 1000th in our standards is above and beyond attention 1000th 1000th bonus question how many thousandths equal a 100th the pattern continues
10s 1010101010 if we kept going it would be 10 of these to make one of these thing so when you get a 10 what do you need to do numbers what did we do when we get 11s or we get 1010s do if i have 1010s am i going to write i ve got 11s like this in this place
do what s that
one.0 nope you got to you got to you got to make it go what do you call it when it makes it regroup no
if you end up with 1010s we don t have i ve got 1010s if you say i ve got 1010s what do you say regroup we talked about money have one one if you had 10 pennies you could turn it into what into a dollar that would be an amazing trick
bank 10 pennies can be turn into what equal a whole dollar right all right so that s what we re going to be working on today
we re going to be working on adding these decimals not only in the traditional way but also looking at them on a number line
line it s really hard to picture decimals because up until now we ve only worked with whole numbers
there i m really expecting everyone to be on their best behavior today if i m dividing this into tenths when we did this with fractions how many pieces did i have to cut into if i wanted to show tenths on here right yeah a fraction over this we call this 10th
it s the same thing as 110th is the same thing as this 10 i ll try to make it as even as possible
tenths let s start by adding .2 .2 volunteer come up and show me where .2 would be no 0.20.2 is the same thing really 2 tenths
is all right thank you very much
down thumbs up if you agree thumbs down if you disagree why because you don t count the 0 she s right do you count the 0
yes if this is a 0 it would be 0 tenths right nothing so we ve got one space and we re at 110th at 2 tenths except we re not working with fractions
today one.2 all right we re at .2 add what are we adding to 2 tenths me we re at 2 tenths
tenths come on up together come point to where we re going to be 2 tenths +6 is it +6 or +6 tenths it s 0.6 0.6 so where are we going to go
i want everyone s best listening lips right now t 0.8 or how can we say that instead of 0.88 tenths
tenths plus one or 110th +2 tenths +3 tenths +4 tenths +5 tenths sense +2 plus .6 gets us to .8 all right now who can show us plus .3
tenths come on up begging i ll help you through promise pencil down tenths you think right here
there what do we have to do to this section 1st how many tenths do we have before we get to one here but what do i need to put on this line 1st so everyone can see it
that all right so if we jump 3 i m not going to draw one at a time i m just going to draw the 3 at we re at 11 tenths we re at 11 tenths
no he s claiming this is 11 tenths down i like the thumbs up because in fractions we learn this is equal to what 11 tenths is we call this a mixed number or sorry an improper number which we can change to a mixed number
m okay it would be one one and as a fraction we would change it to one one 10 absolutely all right now we have our .2 and .2
does anybody want to show those come on up
jumps there you go
good all right do we see where our answer is here i m going to show you where some of your answers were when you had .16 here s one here s .2
here because when we get to the one tells us how many pieces we break each spot into
morning tenths tenths if we re using 2 numbers what s our place value looking at 10 now it would take me forever to draw this but here would be 10 11 12 13 14 15 166 it would be between one and .2 would it make sense to have .16 as an answer
no all right so let s see how we do on this i did want to get to the hundredths today we haven t but we still have at least half the class left so no worries yet tomorrow i m going to come around and help if you get stuck
though i m not here to give you the answer but i definitely want to help you get the answer yes do we have to draw a number line you re lining them up top to bottom one or the other best i m glad you decided to join us
that can you speak a little louder because you re saying some genius stuff right now
and i know that 4 tenths +2 tenths equals 6 tenths and 6 tenths +8 tenths is one.40
one.50 then i know one.50 plus another one.50 it s interesting that you switched from tenths to hundredths but you re absolutely correct
that i might come back and ask you how come you were able to go from tenths to say without changing your answer here i added them up and then so you re answer s right but i m seeing still that .14
.6 plus .8 is .14 become write the fraction 10 tenths what does that equal
one whole right so as soon as you get to 10 tenths you come up with one whole so you ve had 14 tenths right so that s the same as saying one whole and 4 tenths the key to doing it is when you get that group of 10 you carry it over you don t just move the decimal you carry it into the next place value what s the place value to the left of 10 tenths
see what s the place value to the left one whole place so when you come up with your 10 tenths you carry into your whole got it job i m seeing a lot of people using the traditional way
up 4 tenths +2 tenths is 6 tenths 6 tenths +8 tenths is 14 tenths but that one gets carried over so it becomes one and 4 tenths one and 4 tenths +110th is one and 5 tenths right one and 5 tenths +5 tenths is
is 2 and no 5 tenths +5 tenths is what s 5 and 510 okay so 5 tenths and 5 tenths is equals one whole all right so now you add your one whole from earlier plus this one whole to give you a total of how much 2 all right so you re at 2 and 2 tenths makes sense
right correct i ll be right back with you know that s what i like seeing i like seeing the diagrams there i can see that you re making those groups of 10 tenths or one wholes
yes can it wait 15 minutes
it s a pretty all encompassing camera there so just hurry up and come right back in do added them okay you added them all up and you got 20 right
so if you were just to add up these numbers and you got 20 would you put something here right we re doing the same thing when we re adding this way
place when you got your 20 same as always you put your 0 and you carried the number into the next greater place value value since these are tenths we carry it to the next largest place value which is your ones
hallway let s for a moment ignore the decimals everyone count with me
is 152020 what would i say to do next this would i write my 20 like this the 2 in the ones place and the 0 somewhere over there
place because right 21 is the same as 210s and 01s right in that s as simple as the decimal i m waiting until i see all eyes on me
a lot of us are making this mistake regrouping once we reach 10 of these we need to move it over into the next place value it might help some of you to look at it this way
exist we are dealing with zeros in our ones place this he saw this as 10 tenths which means this right here is equal to one whole one.0 or one whole as just called out 0.6 and 0.4 made another one whole
groups all right so if this equals 2 what am i going to get if i added an extra number in here what if i added i want to add an extra number
beginning 0.05 know good
in good no add it in
work some of you are getting this really quickly it i promise we re all going to get this but i need you all sitting up with best listening lips on
and that s the same reason we can t add we cannot get 2.5 out of this this what place value is this 5 in no
0 tenths we have to add our 100th to the hundredths so how can we line this up to make more sense that does that line up our place values no
what do we need to do to line up our place values okay so we have 01s 0 tenths and 5 hundredths okay we need the decimal this is lining it up
yes what do we treat this empty space as a 0 a 0 this is saying i ve got 2 and 0 tenths and 0 hundredths i still only have 2 from the hundredths the hundredths 5 hundredths +0 hundredths is
50 tenths and 0 tenths is 00 tenths and is that tenths 01s +21s is 21s 21s very good who can show me where this is going to be on our number line
g tell the class what you re doing right now
there s a 5 in the hundredths place and you have to divide the 10s into you have to divide each 10 into
tenths each 10 into tenths so he s dividing it up right now is that right is that right
here he has his 2 one his 2.2 he s cut each one up into 10 pieces it what do we know about the number 5 as far as 10s go it s in the hundredths place it s in the hundredths place so is that going to be between these 2 numbers or between these 2 numbers
is it between 2 and 2 one or 2 one and 2.2 no how far do you think it s going to be between the .0 and the one a quarter do you think a quarter half why half
because you re absolutely right clicking why is your brain telling you it s going to go halfway in between
right so you have the last problem before i collect them right let s see who s got this and who again it s the 1st day you have the test tomorrow but we still have another lesson in between there i m going to give everyone a piece of paper to solve this on
please put your name date i am but it s not a quiz worth a lot we ll see where people are can i get you to cut these into thirds and halves and give everyone a piece
it actually i m going to do 2 problems the 1st is just tenths the 2nd one is tenths and hundredths if you get the 1st one done you re on a great track there if you can t get it right should you just give up
no keep trying and i ll see where you are if i find you staring at a blank paper i m going to have no idea where you re making a mistake out this is problem one
please no talking or distracting the people next to you board i m putting it that way so i can see are you doing it the traditional way
line if you still have to draw the cubes like you did the other day to show these you can draw the cubes
way i like what you re thinking what you ve got going on there
remember it s the 712 so if you get the 1st one and you re not sure about the 2nd one give it a try
paper hands down
minutes it is not a race so go back and double check remember i d hate to see you get it wrong because you made a simple mistake in just adding the numbers together today is the 10th april 10 problems this one is across and this one is down
why the change this one gotcha eyes on your work interesting give it a shot give it a shot and see what you come up with okay
we ve got a half hour intervention later and this is what i m going to focus on the problems i see with this we re going to revisit it right before lunch for another half hour to go over some of the confusion still is this the same thing as one person makes the mistake of calling out one i ll collect them in a couple of minutes 1st and last names and the date
today is april 12 more minutes and 2 more minutes the answers on these pages are making me very happy
you guys are doing a great job on this you didn t need my help that s the right answer it s amazing what we can accomplish when we try it easier than you thought yes
give it a shot for me okay me i see some people breaking into smaller pieces that they re more able to work with
up do you want me to put so you went from i need help to put another one up there
right yay
minute once we understand the idea of place value once we realize that 10 hundredths equals 10 tenths and 10 tenths equals one whole we can start adding decimals of any size so as long as we keep in mind once you get 10 of one place value it creates one over in the next greater place value
one i would like you to try
interesting interesting i m sorry but you do awesome nice job
so we went from not being able to do tenths to doing the bonus where some of us are getting to the thousandths here close so you think this is the real answer or it s close to the real answer
see 2.9964 so you moved that to a 3 and then you put that .01 back later thinking so the only problem is i think there s a number missing here somewhere but 123333 right here 3 +3 +3 is
one and 2 is 3 +3 is perfect close you got the thousandths and that s what i thought would trick people
is that s what i m going to need the moment for to turn off the cameras and take off
equipment i m sure they will appreciate it and get a giggle out of hearing this conversation right now
so the last few days we ve been talking about area and perimeter today we re going to be switching it up
here last week before vacation and this week we ve been talking about area and perimeter and today we re going to start talking about a different area of measurement we measure things differently we re talking about area and perimeter what kind of shapes are we talking about when we find the length and the width
2 dimensional 2 dimensional shapes today we re going to be getting into we re going to talk about volume what do you know about volume already
what is it that you know about volume did you study volume in 4th grade at all volume it s length times width volume has to do with length times width times height
volume you look like you re thinking there about you don t know how to say it okay well think about it a volume fills 3 dimensions you re absolutely right
whereas area and perimeter deal with 2 dimensional shapes we re just talking about length and width like in the example from yesterday up on the board dimensions we re talking about length we re talking about width and we re talking about what s left height so for instance here i have this rectangular prism that i built it s different from the shapes we ve worked with previously
we ve been working with polygons rectangles squares that kind of thing 2 dimensional shapes length and width 2 dimensions shapes these shapes have length they have width and they also have height so they have 3 dimensions to them
sense so these are our objectives for today this is what i want you to by the end of the day i want you to feel comfortable with
volume if you already know volume a little bit we re going to explore it a little bit more and again just like with area and perimeter we re not just going to be finding the volume of different rectangles we re going to be expanding it to higher level thinking beyond what you did last year we re going to construct a strategy for determining the volume of rectangular prisms and it sounds to me like some of you may already have a strategy
we re going to explore that a little bit more in depth to figure out why exactly so up here i want you to pretend you work at a factory
do if you worked in a factory what kind of job would you have what would you be doing what would you do if you worked in a factory usually factories have to do with machinery and different things right
m a factory is also a place where you build or make something yep usually you build or you re making something
stuff did anybody go to staples or to ups or anything with your parents who had packages to ship before the holidays or anything and you ve got to go and make sure that if it s something that s breakable it s packed right and that it s cushioned and nothing will break
figures they re like these little toy figures about this big each toy figure is the same size and it s packaged in one of these little cubes so it s a really tiny little toy figure and they re packed in one of these tiny cubes we re going to pretend so they fit inside a little box that s this big
each toy figure is the same size it s packaged in a little cube and you often need to ship more than one toy figure at a time so this is the little toy figure packed in the cube and you have to ship more than one at a time bulk do you know what it means by in bulk what do i mean by in bulk more than one right a whole bunch at the same time
so over the next few days today tomorrow and monday we re really going to be determining how many cubes will fit in these different shipping boxes and we re going to decide whether there s a way that we can figure this out without actually having to build or construct the boxes
we re going to come up with a strategy of how to put these in here
this is one of your toys these are the boxes we re going to be packing them into
to make different shipping boxes this is the way that we have to do them because do you think boxes just come all folded up like this this they usually go and buy a box you have to fold it correctly and put it together come so we have these shapes here that look like this
we have the bottom which is the base and then we have to fold the sides up and we have to put it together like that to make it into our box m i did that as a project in 4th grade you did this in 4th grade review we ll skip all the taping and cutting and all that stuff and we ll go right into the harder stuff
we ll use these cubes as the unit to find the volume of the box so the paper says how many cubes fit in each box 1st turn in the number of cubes while building the box then build the box and use cubes to check
check your 1st answer with you actual answer before going on to the next block think about a way you could find the number of cubes that would fit into a box while building it what i want you to do right now is we re going to estimate 1st on both sides of this paper
we re going to see if we can figure up just by looking at it how many cubes we think will fit in each box guess you re going to look at the box and decide how many cubes you think will fit in there for instance on number one you have the box there
paper how many cubes do you think will fit in that box and write it down next to the 1st answer on number one
box remember each one is a little cube we re going to estimate the whole thing before we go on
what you re going to do next you can see that everybody has a box of snap cubes on your desk snap cubes can be fun to work with or they can sometimes be a little bit frustrating because they re hard to snap together and to get them to stay together you can work together on this because this is the kind of thing where maybe you and someone else at your table you want to work together to construct box one
together so what you re going to do is you have to you re going to construct each box like how do i know i did this correctly because you have yeah i looked at how it could be folded it i noticed there s a face that s facing me
there s 3 across the bottom and there s 2 going up to the top right so the length is 3 the height is 2 and if i count along the side i can see the width 1234 is 4 so that would look like box one one so that s why it s a good idea to work with someone else because you can check that together
so get your partner to help you check your box once you ve finished 12 and 3 you put down your actual answers and call me over so i can check it before you go on to 45 and 6
make sure you re working together and you share we don t have enough for everybody to build their own boxes either so that s why you need to work in pairs
them like this
patterns if you need to i can give you paper and you can cut them out but it will take a really long time and since you already know so much i m not interested in you cutting them out in the shapes and everything so right now if you need to you can but right now i think a lot of you are going to be okay just with building
how many boxes do you know go on the bottom the length there s 3 boxes here so how many 3 and how many don t take them apart you re okay
so that s at the bottom and how many are going to go up
here i did 4
so that s we have the length we have the width we have the height how many are going to go here 33 again right
3 so you make a whole box
yeah you re going to have to work with it s hard to make these right
now i d say hey can we combine some of these instead of taking time to build our own that s the important part of this lesson it s doing it right not so much the pretty colors i know it s fun to make pretty colors but has that there
0 don t take that apart great we can add yours right on there then by working together you have the whole shape the whole box
because we re supposed to add these that s okay we ll use s so we ll take s and take s and put them together
done you re just building it s too big side it s not supposed to have a big space in the middle let s look at the picture and why this is correct box look at the front of the box and in the picture
front 33123 on the bottom row because that s our length of the box here we have 3123 by 2 then what do you notice about the width
back 41234 we have 3 by 2 by 1234 right so you see how built one layer and built the other layer and now you put the other and now look at how much time that saves so now you have to figure out how many cubes are actually in this box
it 4 times 126 +12 is 18 and then 18 +62424 do you think so you did 6 here and then you did 12 here and then you did 6 more over here
these i would count so show me exactly what we re doing here
6 so you re going to look at this and you re going to say all right there s 4 going across there s 4 here in the width there s 3 on the length and then there s 2 on the height you re thinking if you multiply this together you get 3 times 2 is 6 and then times 4 here would be 24
c i d count them by 2 s 2468 and how about the ones in the middle you d have to count them by 3 s because now what did you notice
doing and he was saying like 1234 but is that the same cube right there no cube 24 is this the same cube once once right so this would be like 2468 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
see the difference there what if you had 10 by 10 or 10 by 8 or something crazy like that so that s another way you can count it that way
m okay so there s 2 on the height and you get 24
24 so i think that s a good actual answer so why don t you write that down experience so see how working together it s easier and having the conversation about it next maybe and build the next box together and you build the same box at the same time as they are
you can use that and take it apart and then come together and talk about it box what are the dimensions of the next box 3 by 5 by 3 what are the dimensions of the next box 3 by 5 by 3 awesome good job
so you build that one like you built the 1st one so now you re going to come together and talk about em here i think you used a lot more than 9 cubes here huh so it s tough getting those in right yes
okay as long as it s close enough so why don t you start so what do you notice about this 1st box here
are count them okay go ahead and count them 2424 go ahead and count them check right
you want to make sure you re right it s confusing isn t it
middle so what i would do what i like to think of when i think of the side is i think of it just the way you built it you have 3 for your length right 123 what was your height 2 and what s your width 44 so you have 3 by 2 by 4 in your prism so that means there s 3 here there s 3 on each side
here you have layers of 2 and here you have 4 so you have 3 times 2 times 43 times 2 is 6 and that means that this whole part here is 6 this part here is 6 and this part here is 6 i have 4 groups of 6 so how many are here altogether
too so actually and the other way is you could take it all apart to check it out if you ve finished box 2 check that one have you finished box one yet goodness they re already on box 3 just about
they each one built number one and one built number 31 of the things that works really well is if you work in a way that you can build together so that way you re not all taking your time but yours are getting way too big big it made like a square not quite a square right
box 1234 there s 8 on this side so how many more does she need to make going in one direction
right one more row so we can easily take this like this and go like this and just add on another so hands up
one we have 3 for the length 2 for the height and 1234 for the width you guys are getting really big there so how are you going to go about figuring how many cubes are in there how are you going to count them
we ll do it together where do you want to start
you want to start on this side okay count okay and now what do we have to count did you count them all yet
what else do you have to count that side there s 24 so see if you count the ones up here you have 24 and down here you have 24 way how would you do it
how would you count them
since there s 2 blocks on each one i counted like 2468 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 so you got 24 as well so what s the answer 24 i think it s 28
it i would look at this and i d say okay the length is 33 tiles long it 2 right so there s 6 here there s 6 here that means there s 6 here there s 6 here and there s 6 here so 3 by 2 is 6 and i count up the side and get 1234 there s 4 groups of 6 here
that 12346 times 4 is what 2424 so what i did is i looked at the length i looked at the width and i looked at the height and i put them all together and i got 24 now since you already have box 3 built right here why don t you do box 3
i think you have to add one more layer for box 3 because it s a 2 by 4 by 5 so what i would do maybe 2 of you work on doing box 3 and maybe 3 of you work on box 2
it how did you do here can i see wow your estimates are right on your estimates are right on and your estimates were pretty close what strategy are you using here because you all seemed to be right on when you did this so you kind of used a pattern here that way
i counted them like that and once i calculated that i doubled it that because i did 2 layers okay so you came up with the count of the base here you have the base of the box right here and you counted them and then you said okay there s going to be 2 layers of them so you counted the base kinda like you did the length times the width and you said they were going to be 2 high and you multiplied it that way
strategy i want to hear one other strategy
so you did the same thing so you guys used the pattern to figure out out did you use the same thing or did you use something different you did something different what did you do
i just counted that and turned all that and then i canceled the top 3 and i times them this is confusing to me so i see 3 and 3 and 3 times 3 okay how are we doing here
that s fine you re doing the last one right now
one how come i see some are almost done and some people are on the 2nd is by herself
there i want everyone building so look now you have 3 wide 3 high and 3 wide
why would you use 4
53 times 3 is 9
9 times 3 is 27 right maybe you and can work together to get the last one
job that s number what number 3
if i think of this as 3 times 2 and then 6 times 5 that s 30
no there s 6 in the picture no look at the picture you re not even looking you re playing with 8 right
layers look at the length on the side what i want you to do is build that extra layer on here one i did the 3rd one
now aren t we doing the 3rd one
did you finish number 2 you re working on number 3 number 2 let s look at it
apart yeah let s put all the extra cubes inside so we don t get confused you have 2 and 3 built already so put them in here did you build number 2
right 9 times 3 is is where do you see 4 show me 4
you re saying that you re going to be adding 2 more groups of 6
thing you all got the same thing i thought it was 27 because you just told me it was the same thing as everyone else
how many are on this bottom layer if we just looked at this if we were just going to think about this bottom layer here how many here
4 times 5 is what 40 so we have 4 times 5 times 2 and that gave us 40 i was doing something do you see how you re rushing and not listening to anybody else
do you see how important it is to work together and listen to other people and look at what other people are coming up with and listen to their thoughts it s really important to listen to everybody s ideas and for everybody to contribute because you have important ideas too
number 4 is a little bit trickier number 4 is just giving you the pattern but if it was in a box what would it be
so i m going to give you a trick on figuring out number 4 because we re getting short on time here
so we have boys and girls just to give you a last minute check we have about another 5 minutes then i m going to give you a sheet to kind of wrap up your thinking here
box what that means is that this is one bottom part here this is going to give me my length and my width it s kind of like layer across layer remember on the other side
how many layers tall is it going to be it s going to be how many layers tall
actually this one isn t too far off
it s 6 by 3 so you have 12345
we have 123456 by 3 and then how many layers tall is it going to be
did you even add onto this one
before you were talking about how this was you have a row of 8
how many rows of 8 do you have there 5 layers of 8 right
is how many layers of 2 do you have 5 so 8 times 5 is what
40 right look at it this way 4 times 1234 times 4 times 5 is 20 and 4 times 2 is
then this here is the bottom layer and then it doesn t go as high as this one high so 3 and 3 here and 123456
place what i want to do is check in with everybody and see what you re thinking up to this point about how you came up with your answers because i have some different thoughts here cubes i shouldn t hear anybody touching snap cubes
so how did you go about coming up with your answers here your cubes here room what were some of the different strategies people came up with
i noticed that you noticed that it s actually your thinking is exactly right on here that s what we call does anybody know the word that we call this the same thing
base length times width length times width so came up with the length and the width here what was the length
3 what was the width 6 what so that is 18
18 what did you do after that 18 times what and if you counted these here what did you get when you did that i got 18
total you got 54 for that one m i have a different way what did you do i counted i did like from the top
then you figured out the length and width of this one and the length and width of this one way on number 2 we re still on number 4
a on number 4 i which was
54 so what i m hearing you say is that you added 18 +18 +18 yes so what did you get the 3 you did here we call that the height don t we
high so our base it s telling us that our base is 18 and then we have 3 layers probably 183 times you ve got your base of 18 and then you multiplied that times your height which we said is how high is it 33 layers and you got 54 right so you came up with a volume of 54
so what i m hearing here i m hearing lots of different strategies that people are coming up with the answers here lots of different ways that people are coming up with different answers mostly everybody is arriving at the same answer did you find that you all could work together and talk about it and build together
i also noticed that a couple of people at this one table everybody thought the answer to number 2 was 54 and one person held strong and said no it s not it s 27 and she convinced the rest of the table that the answer was 27 and she was absolutely correct
strong she didn t just join the group and say the answer is 54 like everybody else said she held strong and said nope it s 27 and this is why it s 27 and she told everybody else exactly why she did that it was m so tomorrow we re going to continue with this and look at the length the width and the height we re going to develop more of an algorithm and look at how we can do this quickly without having to build these boxes
we re going to come up with that tomorrow
using equations to find okay equivalent fractions
equations today what we re going to do is an exemplar and in this exemplar you re going to use numbers words pictures to solve the problem i don t just want if you just decide you re going to do it in numbers
that i want numbers words and pictures ways you will work in a group
work come on over here
could you push that out of the way please get started on it sorry but yesterday s group didn t want you in their group

so what is your group doing trying to figure out how many slices will his friend get a fair share of pizza and how many friends are there 6 count them
i was just asking because i think that s something you need to think about
have 18 pizzas not pizzas pieces 3 pizzas okay figure it out
are all those pieces the same size
no then how many it s harder if you cut it the same size but they re not going to get the same size
would you like to be the person that only gets one of those when it comes to yes
there 6
share 6 12 18
think about it
how are you going to do that i m expecting each one of you to be working on this at 1st we were work with your group
yes at 1st we were arguing but now we good good all right i want to know how much pizza each person gets
one slice for each person the question is about fair shares
shares this is our picture does this also count the numbers well the numbers would be how much each person gets right
work with your group please
there there s some up there on top of the filing cabinet what are fair shares
would you rather have one of these pieces or one of these pieces if it was cheese what about the other people in your group
i figured out that we can make 6 because the friends have to have equal pieces right so maybe you can divide all the pieces into 8
group sit down it s over there explain to me what you did group 1st okay
and then sit down
you need to come here because you re not talking about what you re supposed to be talking about
this one they can all get a piece of pizza and from this one they can also all get a piece of pizza and there will be 2 leftover we can t have any leftover
all 6 of them need to get that come here
i m going to ask you to go over by the computers sorry can he look at one of yours did you find that one
excuse me this not really tell me what you did
and divided it by 8 and then each person got 4 pieces of pizza okay so as a group though you have to come to a decision
they have to have a fair share of pizza that s not the question
if you got one of these pieces this is only for 4 people we have to have it for 6 people give me 5
you must come to a decision as a group i m going to give you one marker and one piece of large chart paper
sit down who s going to do yours
down yes and you ve come up with some way to decide who is going to do it
group you may sit with and work with him
group this is what you re recording on
decided that s what we did group when i looked over there you were not talking about this
you may go back to your group and contribute but this is what you re talking about else you re listening you may go put your head down somewhere you have 5 minutes to do this
group pictures words and numbers
what happened is people didn t want you in their group
so you divided each pizza into 8 pieces then divided 24 by 6 wait we had 3 okay good you re doing a nice job of sharing very nice job
job wow
are you telling me that each person gets half of this one half of this one and half of this one
each one will get a half of a 4th that s the only thing they ll get a half of
okay if i divided it into 82 sixths of an 8 i have to divide those 2 pieces into 6
okay tell me what we re doing here making our chart drawing the pizza under or the side
either all right now do you agree with this
is there a way you can get them to yes divide them by 3 and they get equal shares but they want the same piece of pizza the same size
3 slices are they all 3 the same size no
so what do you need the bigger the number gets the smaller the pizza slices get okay 5 this group has only been talking to this group
this group has only been talking to that group
how many in your group so describe say that in words
group by now you should have it done the idea was to make sure all 6 people in the group got a fair share
so we ll find out if our groups solved this after we re done presenting it then we can think if we didn t think so then what could we do see now you get in your group you did not get your way so you decided to just leave
good audience we re listening see what we think it i m not doing that right now
group all right explain it to us
24 do you need some help explaining it from your group
her you divided every pizza by 8 okay it didn t say you couldn t do that did it
start so when you divided every pizza by 8 did everybody get the same sized pizza same sized piece did everybody agree with them that everybody had a fair share disagree why do you disagree
1st of all they only had 3 pizzas they have 3 pizzas do you have 6 pizzas no
okay divide 6 by 18 and 18 by 6
it they don t have 18 slices have we have 24 slices how did you get 24 slices
because what they went back and decided instead of dividing one by 4 am i telling this right
one by 6 and one by 8 they went back and divided every pizza by 8 right so then they would have 24 pieces in all and could divide that evenly by 6 questions all right
you you can just stick that thank you
right next piece group rather s group all right explain it to us
we divided them into 8 equal slices then we divided 24 by 6 4 okay
so you kind of decided to do what the other group did went back and divided each pizza by 8 in 8 pieces
4 we checked because 4 times 6 equals 24 very nice thank you very much is this group ready okay good all right okay i am talking about math right now
all tell us what you did okay
get explain it because you re explaining that other part to me okay thank you for sharing with
for the division what am i doing wrong we did 4 +6 +8 all at once and got 18
for the division we got to the we had the 6 but for our answer down here for 18 we put it over here and then we got like the 6 is the children okay
they would get 3 pieces of pizza but they have to be the same size so they have to be the same size so then how did you do that part
all right how many people have questions agree disagree all right just a 2nd we re not done does anybody need anything clearer did you get how they were dividing the leftover pieces
what is your problem with that
they would get 2 normal size pieces and 2 tiny pieces we divided the tiny pieces out of 4 all right let s go
me be polite explain you know what
interesting explain how you divided one into 4 the other into 6 but they weren t all equal why did you do it that way tell us
interesting go ahead she s going to explain it right now
so now each one she s got each one of these so each one of these is the same size then she s got this half she divided into 4 and each one of those was the same size as each one of these so if you do this and this together how did the 6 people get the same size there
i asked her honey come here so i can see it then if you have something different you can say something thank you the rest of you for being polite staying not asking to go somewhere
excellent very nice thank you why don t you put yours over on one of those doors i m going to move them all but just put yours over there
tomorrow last group you stay and you listen politely to theirs
wait go ahead all right so now tell us how much each person got
how about that 4th person 18th then another 8th and 16th so did they all get the same amount no
can someone help them j it s not hard
go so we should be good with this right here we go kiddos mountain math we did 12 and we re going to do 3 this week
up let s see if you guys know the 3 angles we ve been discussing down we re not worried about our shoes right now and make sure we get in a spot we don t kick anybody go over there on that side or this spot right there beside
his perfect right there angle give me i m not going to give you a number
angle very good give me right angle again straight right angle keep them straight come on it s straight
time give me 90 degrees give me 45 degrees come on again come on one give me 135
180 all right everybody to your seat very good right now i ask you get your mountain math out
a 90 degree angle what s the term for a 90 degree angle angle 45 degree angle what s the term for that angle
acute give me the definition for an acute angle less than 90 degrees if i say 135 degrees give me the term for this angle obtuse someone give me the definition for an obtuse angle
p more than 90 degrees more than or greater than 90 degrees very good angle very very very good
ahead greater than 135 135 what tool do we use when measuring angles e protractor
protractors we talked about what the numbers around the top represent like it s some tool you use we use regularly your parents or dad may use like
ruler we talked about the scales and how the scales differ how you have a scale going from 0 10 in this direction then 0 180 and then you have 0 180 here you look at number 3 what would that angle be classified as
e acute it s an acute angle because it is less than 90 degrees all right
for when we re measuring angles sometimes the rays the way the angles are drawn when you have examples sometimes the rays are short so you use this as your marker to place on the ray so you know precisely what the degree of your angle will be
for example say for instance if i did an angle like this and i began to measure it 0 and my ray is not long enough so i can use the string to make sure i get a precise measurement see that
ms k put that on there so she could get a precise measurement that all right this was just an example of another type of protractor and it was just our way it was just for me to show you guys the ones you ll be using once we start measuring angles
calendars i didn t tell anybody to move
calendars s group go ahead and go back
started the next group let s go and s group you guys have about 5 minutes maybe
paper i know you have great things in that brain of yours paper whatever it is i want to see it on your paper okay guys i m going to step over you started today is thursday november 15th 2012
j okay me i did 5 fifteenths and got 10 thirtieths 5 fifteenths times 2 over 2 and what did you get
correct these are equivalent fractions definition
about when you multiply them and divide them an even or equal number that they can still go into each other i know where you re going but i m looking for a clear definition
when you multiply them or divide the fraction yes that s the those are the operations you use when finding equivalent fractions but who can help her clear that up
a an equivalent fraction is a fraction that has the same amount but it s put into different sized pieces different pieces yes when you multiply the number of pieces are getting what
smaller when you divide the number of pieces are getting bigger very good asked a very good question yesterday during our centers about equivalent fractions missus l i m not quite sure how to find them the example that we used was a half and 2 fourths was that the example that we used
this we said if i have a model actually 2 models and i want to show that the fractions are equal i want to represent a half here and 2 fourths here all i do look at my denominator and see how many pieces i m supposed to have here pieces in this model i m supposed to have 4
so my numerator one is being manipulated correct so i have a half here and i have 2 fourths here if i go ahead and shade those 2 fourths in and that half in this model shows that they are equal what s another way to show that these 2 fractions are equal
one 15 divided by 5 equals 3 do what did he divide by here to get his fraction in simplest form
he divided it by 5 over 5 but why 5 because it is the greatest common factor gcf very good he got a 3rd now why is a 3rd considered a fraction in it s simplest form
why do we say that s in its simplest form and that isn t because it can t be divided by anything what s the greatest common factor between one and 3
one you can keep dividing by one and you re going to keep getting what a 3rd you re going to keep getting the same numbers so i go back to here a half and 2 fourths i showed you guys that they re equal with the use of a model
2 you can multiply a half times 2 over 2 and you end up getting 2 fourths excellent computation let s look at the 3rd for a 2nd what s another way to write that what s another way to show that amount 13rd one out of 3
that while you re pondering on that anybody else care to share anything they learned in calendar a i actually have something else what else if you multiply it by 5 over 5 you would get 2570 fifths very good
k i got something for okay talk to me 15 is odd and composite and i can put that into hold on composite she said she has evidence to support this number being composite
i want you to go to the board and show me that evidence and i would like for to go help her evidence what else can you tell me from calendar
then let them do their evidence and we re going to see if your array matches up with what they have up there for their evidence j i have a fraction 71 hundredths where did you get that from
c he said that this model represents what 71 hundredths 71 of 100 what s another way to write that or show that or represent that percent what s another way to write that or show that or represent that
711 hundredths come and show me what you mean because we said there is another way to show 711 hundredths come show me very good in the form of a decimal 711 hundredths in 71 hundredths how many tenths do i have
7 how many hundredths do i have 71 in 71 hundredths 70 i mean 7
out we have tenths how many hundredths think about hundredths put your hands down for a 2nd okay a 10th is one of these columns this is the 10th unit right here 10 okay
now if i m just looking at the individual units what are those called the units what are they also called here pick somebody to help you ones what else p units what else
units i believe it s what would one of these equal here
okay 100th so pretty much what we re saying here in 71 hundredths we have 7 tenths
that s almost saying how much money do you have if you have 7 tenths of a dollar ¢70 if you have 100th of a dollar how much money do you have if you have 100th of a dollar how much money do you have
cent so you put that ¢70 and one together and how much money is 71 hundredths ¢71 take your calendars and go to your seats and i didn t forget about the 3rd either
tomorrow say that again sweetie have i done my calendar today
better very good children
right last night for homework you guys were doing problem solving but this time we decided to mix it up a bit before we get into that i want to see what and did up here to prove that 15 was composite
kiddos get out a red pen you know what kiddos what typically happens
time because our computer is froze up and it s not working right now that your dad s computer can t help me right now
end so fun how that always messes up at inappropriate times now for the past 23 weeks we have been discussing long division correct correct we ve been talking about the division algorithm right
we ve been talking about how with division all you re doing is you re sharing and you re sharing amongst groups again there we go
okay so we re going to do an example 1st then after we do that example you guys are going to do practice on your own quick review so say for instance we have 316 and we want to divide 316 by 3
dividend your dividend is the amount you are what dividing raise your hand help yeah you re dividing it but what does that mean sharing you re sharing 316 amongst how many
people or 3 who said groups groups very good so i look at 316 and remember i told you guys we don t go 3 goes into 3 number we think about the place value okay
c 3 i have 3 hundredths there so i m thinking of 300 what s the max amount i can put in each of those groups groups
one i can put one in each group and if i have 3 groups and i put one of those hundredths in each group 3 groups of one gives me how many 300 it gives you 300 or 3 very good so how many hundredths do i have now
0 so i bring down my 10 right yeah can i take that rod and it s me and and can i actually give each one of us a rod
raise your hand and tell me what i need to do to that 10 10 come on
as regroup or rename it as something i need to divide it up into something where i can split it amongst 3
to i need to change it to something smaller so i can break it up yes so a 10 is equal to how many ones 10 so now i have 11s or 10 units
up i have not split those up yet because let me go back rod i determined that my rod wasn t going to fit i put my 0 here because i couldn t split it up i still have my rod that s when i regrouped it or renamed it to make it 10 units
down now i have 16 units split up in 3 groups
eyes i have 16 units to split up in 3 groups pretty much what they re saying is i have 16 of these to split up in 3 groups what
5 5 times 3 or 3 groups of 5 will give me what 15 now i have a unit left hand i have one single unit left up what do i need to do next
remainder meaning i have one leftover but check this out not only have i i have to turn that off for a 2nd not only have you guys been doing that but we ve been working on another strategy correct yes i ve been noticing that some of you guys have been using that in your work but you re not using it correct
we have 316 divided by 3 what strategy have we been using besides common division i m going to call on random students okay m partial quotient partial quotient strategy
316 what s the max amount that i can put in 3 groups or share in 3 groups come on amount you re doing a great job paying attention
going 100 times 3 and i want you to talk for 16 you can fit 5 in 3 groups after that and it will equal 15 then it equals one and you put one as your remainder then what do i do you add the together okay then you have to check to see if it s right very good then what do you do
you have to you want to see if you got the dividend very good
what s one thing that he did one thing he did that you know ms l is like you ve got to do it like this so we make sure we have our it s correct it s accurate 0 my god 010s 5 units one leftover
job line up your numbers bud this is what we re going to do
pencil you don t need notebook paper
it my paper passer outer i need you to pass these out for me and when you get your paper you re going to put your name and today s date which is the 15th
actually put one on s name and today s date today is the 15th
r can we start no because you have not heard my directions yet ms l is going to tell you what i m looking for ready all right this is what you see
let me see if i i just messed up my focus hold on l hold on
right i think i might have to use a marker okay ms l is going to zoom in on this 1st problem so bear with me because i want you to follow my directions because you get points for following directions we know that we re doing basic long division correct
yes now there are 3 things that i need to see with each problem you guys get to use whatever strategy you want to use column division or partial quotient okay but after you use your strategy you have to check it for me the same way did when he came up on the board
okay then after you check it you have to answer the question in the form of a complete sentence one the park s sprinkler s can spray 280 gallons on the grass in 7 minutes how many gallons can they spray in one minute
so i m looking at this and thinking 7 minutes equals 280 gallons what i m trying to find out is how many of those gallons are in one minutes
that what operation can i use to determine that r division so i m going to come down and i m going to write my strategy
ms l is going to use i m going to use partial quotient you pick the strategy that you want to use and ms
after i use my strategy i m going to go ahead and check my work how many gallons can they spray in one minute
my answer they can spray this is my work
that s fine okay so where is my quotient there you need it 3 very good
i want you to write strategy check answer now for those of you that are done yours may not look exactly like mine but you should have a strategy
work we should have the same answer regardless of the strategy that you used and some of you guys your check even looks different from mind because you chose to use partial product lattice some of you guys chose to use crash boxes
very good i like to see that you guys are using the different strategies that we learned you may now finish
yes ma am yes okay relax let s go this way
down hey you have all that information in your head is you re saying it and losing that information that you re saying
down you can put your here but that s what you were thinking i want to see your thinking 7 times this 7 times that show your work
i want to see what you re thinking just like you did with this problem right here sweetie okay do you need paper no you need to go back and check okay
okay what s up multiplying are you multiplying in your head right now
a so what do you do
just wait
it does
move several of you have scrap paper i want you to put your name on your scrap paper and your actual sheet your work
now i want you to put them together this sheet on top okay now everybody look at me once you have your name written on all of your sheets of paper and stacked on your desk then put your pencil down so i know you re finished or that you re done
okay tonight for homework don t forget our division test is tomorrow so tonight for homework you re going to be doing the review page in your textbook them i want you to go to page 225 and do the even problems only okay
even problems only and use the strategies that we ve learned in class nobody this should be written pencils should be down in your composition books your math composition books
ms l you didn t tell us i m going to put it right here in math composition book because i want to see your work
also your drops are due tomorrow i will be here of course all day tomorrow we re checking everything and i m even going to try to check your test before you leave so you ll know your grade before the break
up all right so yes i ll be checking homework of course drops and we ll be taking our test tomorrow sir are we going to do the centers well we ran out of time because we were waiting on mister s to fix the camera so that took our calendar time 1st part of the morning but centers i m sorry we didn t get to do those today
we re going to do our test 1st tomorrow and right after everybody s done with their test we ll go right into centers that we ll start the test 1st thing start we ll go over the homework make sure there weren t any questions then we ll start the test as soon as the test is over with we ll go straight into our centers
right i m going to come around and once i take your work from today up you can go ahead to the bathroom to the restroom
board okay we re going to work on practicing some division remember we re working on dividing whole numbers
the 1st thing i want you to work on is we re going to be focusing on how do i divide numbers using 2 digit divisors so we re going to be working on models working with arrays and making models the 1st thing i want you to work on and this is going to be on your quiz you can draw this on your white boards
array so we re going to figure out this is what divided by what is going to equal something so these right here are your rows this going across are your rows
i m going to give you some little colored tiles for your table fill in each row with a different color
focused you need to look at your board and figure out what the division problem is right now i want you to draw this array on your board and i want you to put a different color in for each row
remember you want to make each row the same color color this one needs to be a different color
so in this particular problem how many rows should you have going across 5 rows 0 15 how many rows how many different colors do you have
rows in order for you to take the total divided by rows equals your columns so how many different colored rows should you have for this particular problem
have 4 how many should you have 5 i mean 33 you should only have how many rows only 3 rows
difference how many rows so if i was going to put this array up on the board look at my formula over here you have the total divided by rows is going to equal your columns
so what s my total number of squares on this board 1515 so i have 15
have how many different colored rows do i have 3 so 15 divided by 3 is going to equal 5 how many different columns do i have
5 remember rows go across did you make your different colored rows here how many different colored rows do they have
squares 15 then how many rows do they have
3 then the rest are columns it equals 5 columns we re going to do another one
boards heads up
have how many rows do i have
rows who can explain to me what rows are t they re the blocks that run across across so when you make your grid on your white board how many rows are you going to make
55 look here you have 12345
how many different colored rows should you have
across how many total squares do you have on this whole grid if you were going to come up with a division problem for this what would be my total number of squares 25
2020 remember you re counting your total number of square rows so 20 divided by the number of rows have you have 5 equals what 4 how many columns do you have
5 columns 04 remember your columns go this way up and down so if you were going to come up with your division problem you would say 20 total number so 20 divided by the number of rows that you have equals the number of columns do you see that
take your math journal and your math folder out
here the total number of squares divided by the rows equals columns
remember when you re looking at a division array instead of total number of squares you divide by your rows your rows go across equals the number of what
good now we re going to be working with making a model with your division problems
boards on this next one we re going to be working with making models you re going to take your total and divide them into an equal number of groups
so if i gave you the problem 12 divided by 6 how many pieces do you need to take right now
pieces it doesn t really matter what colors
if you want to get all the same color that s fine but it doesn t matter
once you have 12 pieces how many groups are you going to have to have with those 12 pieces you re going to need to have what does my problem say on the board 2 how many groups am i saying to have on the board
6 so you need to take those 12 pieces and make 6 equal number groups out of those if you want to look at what did on his board he wrote out the problem over here
he has 12 pieces and he made 6 groups with the 12 pieces how many did he put in each show them yours
good how many pieces should be in each group 212 divided by 6 is 2
when you re working with these models like this you can t have your total divided by your number of groups so if you re going to see a problem like that presented to i gave you the problem you made the model right
but if i had if i gave you a problem and it had 2 little pieces in each one and i said what is this division problem
if i didn t give you this if i gave you the picture 1st and i said what division problem is this m with how many pieces there are no
i have 2 pieces if i gave you the division problem 1st and i said i want to know what division problem this is problem what are you going to have to do 1st
you re supposed to see how many rows there are arrays we switched from arrays now we re doing models how many pieces how many pieces because remember the total
if i said tell me what division problem this is i need to go count the total number of pieces in all the groups do i m going to do 123456789 10 11 12 so that s 12 then how many groups do i have 6 good i have 6 groups
how many are in each group
2 let s do another one
we have a total of 24 if you want to partner up why don t you i don t know if you ll have enough pieces but if you need to partner up with somebody like your neighbor that s fine
clear your board how many pieces do you need all together pieces what s the total number of pieces
pieces is that 24 now how many groups do you need
3 so you ve got a total of 24 pieces and you have to make 3 different groups you re going to have 8 different groups how many groups are you going to have you re saying it backwards 8 you ll have 3 groups
group 8 look up here on the board your total number of pieces you need to have how many total pieces do you need to have
look how many total number of pieces should you have number 24 how many groups should you have have i have 0 you have 8 groups of 3
need 3 groups of 8 how many need to be in each group
3 and how many need to be in each group
bowls slide them off to the side and clear your boards
on your white board i want you to tell me what division problem is this
up but tell me what is this division problem what is this division problem
you need to go back if you were struggling with this go back and look at this total divided by your number of groups okay
up you re right blue are you ready good yellow now look here
you have 32 divided by how many groups do we have groups orange not yet 4 how many are in each group 88 let s turn it around orange
look at yours you have 32 how many groups do we have up here 5 how many groups did you say on your paper 8 so your problem is how many total pieces are there
32 there s 32 divided by how many groups do i have 4 then how many are in each group 8 questions very good
okay stop touching that i was going to give you no be helpful they re too helpful okay okay remember what you guys have been talking about congruency and non congruent the other day we did something with the geometric figures
today i want to talk about i m noticing people are having issues with the prefixes like what does penta mean
okay so what s going to happen today is you are going to be putting together a prefix booklet okay prefix booklet something kind of sort of like when you do sometimes when you re in reading class they talk about suffixes and prefixes and roots right
okay and what you re going to do is and then you going to help me define the prefixes and suffixes we ve been talking about of the polygons up you don t need that why you up i ll tell you exactly what you do when we get started
back i just said you didn t need it so put it back over there i ll be back over there in a 2nd okay the 1st thing i want you to do on the front side of your book just like a regular book you open up excuse me
do this is what you need to write on that 1st of all at the bottom i want you to write your name and then i want you to write the block we re in which is block 3
looking i can t see what s to see 0 i thought okay you re going to write your name at the bottom and the block we re in block 3
me that s what you need to write on the front right where you are
you should have your name at the bottom our block which is block 3 and the name of the book on the front
me who s still writing are we nope i can only see em
you what are they taking the video for just to see if they give me professional development will it make me a better math teacher there s a program called math solutions i go out of the building ever so often and do professional development
that means other people are teaching me to do all the different activities and then they see if i bring the math solution things back to them and teach it in the class and see does it help my teaching 0 and then at the end of the year you guys take like a test and stuff and they see how that s affected my teaching
that it s just a test to see how well i can teach and does it help the professional development that i get there in the right hand corner so that means when you get your 1st page you will go to the right hand side of it right
yes you re going to write t r i which means what 3 no well actually the right of that the right right side right side no right side means okay this is the paper yeah i write on the right side of it okay okay right yes cause this is the left side right yeah so this will be the right side
it huh yes ma am and you re going to put a little dash right yes in reading you learned about prefixes suffixes and rules right okay so this is a prefix and we re going to just go through it and write our prefixes 1st yes the next prefix i want you to write on the next page what do you think is going to come next
right so on your next page on the right side you re going to write quad cause that s the next prefix good got that this next page that s fine this could be the back or the side space where s your 1st one
right yes right yes we re going to put each one of these prefixes on a separate page boys and girls and when you put it on your separate page you re going to put it on the right side s what does that mean that we re going to put the picture on the left side no no doesn t mean that that s not how we re going to do that
that s going to go over here just to the right side of the paper yeah this is the left side of the paper 0 this is the right side of the paper okay yes yes corner of the paper right side yep right side of the paper each time yeah i put it in what huh that should have been in the right side the top right hand side i m on that s what i mean
huh top right hand side you know when i was coming up when we went to school our name could only be in the top right hand corner of our paper our name and our date and our bell or the block only that side and if we didn t do it guess what they do sometimes threw our papers in the trash 0 no because that s on the left side of the paper this is the right side of the paper you said corner you see that boys and girls i m writing on the right end of the smart board that s where your word need to be
no teacher s i use my hand because i m left handed so i just go on the opposite okay you thank you for that so what do you think comes after quad
who knows think about our polygons anybody back there what do you think come after quad
it trap trapezoid nope what do you think is next
0 cir cir in a circle cinco you guys can t think
suffix i know that i know that i m reading class yep like this penta what did i say okay come on
sit right over there sit beside is with her cause she need her seat back sit beside so she can sit there in her own seat just sit beside her for that and i need to give you a book
on okay page not quite doesn t hex hexa i know hexa teacher s are we going to do the whole we re going to do the whole book and then we re going to come back and then we re going to start doing our what s a name
the definition the definition you all are going to help me write the definition as well as the definition of it as well as actually drawing yeah okay yeah you all are you writing it down yes teacher s isn t pod it means something cause i learned it
here 0 because in 3rd grade my gifted teacher taught us about that it yeah pod means huh hexagon is 6
60 i got the test right because of what the hexagon i forgot it was a hexagon but i still excuse me j i think it is a what do you think the next one is
a non still that is already 9 j octa not quite nonagon what nonagon not quite that s 9 what do you think it s going to be yes octagon octa is not next that s not next
6 octo not that s 8 i just said that i said that we need 7 clue it begins with an h
hepta hex huh i don t know pet that s what the no you didn t you said octagon hepta hey excuse me
this they have that one h e p t a heptagon this is heptagon 1234 what s the next one octagon octa octa yeah 0 yeah octa octa okay you already said that hey still going to be on the right side it s octa i think non now nono nono nono i m telling him i ll deal with him he know what i told him to do
he will just have to redo it
teacher s you said i was wrong for what you said i was wrong about what i asked you where that this was wrong i did the rest what is that i want well this is the left side of the page
page right here on this page this is the right side what is that let s move on nona i got a mama excuse me
give me 54321 me yes that s your next one okay that s a decagon this is your last one we re doing on this decta deca hega deca deca that s deca i thought it was that s not deck 0
that s not the last page i know it s not you just have the extra sheets in there okay
tri sit down here s quad penta hepta hecta octa yeah right here is the hecta okay all right now now cause we got the prefix in there now we re going to go back and actually give definitions for em
tri go back to t r i teacher s i know bless you shh could you wait for 12nd up 1st of all what did we say that means triangle 3 sides so it needs to be what
3 sides so we said 3 sided on what page you could put it underneath it paper ah yes don t you yes 0 yeah you could put it this way you have plenty of writing space on your paper yeah 3 sides
cause i m hearing a lot of small talking and i m trying to teach up there and i hear small small talking back here clear yes so what can we say
a triangle what is what what did we say all of well all of the figures are called what what polygon what else could we say about it what polygon what else it has 3 sides thank you it has 3 sides it ll be you already said 0
where this what tri mean yeah 0 what else 3 angles anything else
3 vertices 3 does it have 3 vertices yes that means corners i know what it is else so that would be vertexes vertices no vertex is one
yes it already has acute angles yeah go one right angle it doesn t always have to have at least one right angle but it does
angle it does have one right angle okay do let me i just drew a line under it
see we are not even at that part yet cause we going to do that down here okay huh we going to do that in a 2nd one the one that we draw this 1st one we re going to draw is going to be called a regular triangle or a regular polygon
every day you yes i like it right was that necessary every day 0 why do you have to say it like that okay
got that everybody got the tri dash 3 sided
that yes because i want to put the irregular triangle over here
it i m going to take care of that too that will be your score to get your regular one that s up there now 0
i m going to take care of that i said i m going to take care of that i said i m going to take care of that teacher s do we have to put the minus thing up there no
that s just an arrow you re going to write irregular irregular yeah okay bless you go ahead and get a tissue teacher s she ll be all right is there any on that thing no i get it for you i think i put some at the top
yes what okay
doing quad quad quad so what could we say a definition for that prefix see what could we say a definition for that 4 sides we just said a definition for this right here 4 sides 4 sides right
huh okay and now we need to do the so what could we do sides so what could we do as far as writing the definition for the polygon we could either do a square or a rectangle okay or a so we could just say or we could say what now we don t want to say quadrilateral cause that means it s going to be equal on all sides right
yeah but it can be equal on all sides but not necessarily it it has 4 sides you could say it s a polygon and it has 4 sides i like that good you all are thinking alike a polygon that has how many sides 4 anything else
ooh this thing is not writing good yeah let me see s i d e s s i d e s what else could we say about it
usually they have 4 angles it anything else
4 vertices 0 i got to realign this board again else 4 angles so you can easily do that one right yes when you draw your example of a regular one would be a square right yes okay or a rectangle or a rectangle so that ll be one that you want to draw up there is a regular one
can we draw both huh can we draw both but you still need to have your irregular ones too if you draw 2 of those as the regular one you need to have an irregular one too okay teacher s what do you huh what is irregular irregular would be one that would not be equal around right i know the one it s like a what
the one that starts off when they re not parallel right here yeah right here this one huh that one wouldn t be like that what about this one that s not a rectangle what what about this one what is that right there trapezoid trapezoid hey
go that s your trapezoid right there that one that we was talking about it was a rhombus on yesterday on the dmr when we were saying that you thought it was a trapezoid this is your trapezoid right here
teacher s you said to be correct we can draw a 3 d trapezoid and this huh to be incorrect we can draw a you can draw one with 4 sides but don t look like this like i think we did something with my little cards today
let me see before can we put a square and then draw another one on top of it and make it look like 3 d 4 teacher s can i draw a rectangle for irregulars okay so you draw one this time i m going to let you draw one inside your book that s irregular and then we will look at it
okay go ahead go ahead you already know how to do a regular one right huh that s just basically let s see
here that s teacher s mine look like trees what you got to draw one for the no
okay square okay so that will be regular right yes cause that s so that s a regular what square polygon or square right cause a polygon is the same thing
you it went back to the some of them probably just break that looks like a square that s kind of in black it s like a rectangle like that teacher b has a touchscreens smartphone well we lost it y all i think i took it off no let s see
okay don t worry about that little thing that s in the corner you already know it s supposed to be a regular polygon right yes or a square a regular square i know what could be and the regular square huh you could draw teacher s water you know we don t do that not during my math class you show sorry absolutely not
you guys back there sit up polygon or it can be square everybody got that how would a irregular one look a rectangle like a rectangle wouldn t that still be a polygon it s still 4 sides yes it wouldn t be like that would be a regular rectangle right yes what did you draw
i drew a trapezoid that one right there yeah this one that that s 1234 i like that one i think it look like this you wait a minute yours is upside down that s it
does that make 1234 don t make no difference whether it s upside down i did that would be your irregular one right
it it looks like it looks like a heart upside down me penta huh penta
huh 55 so we are ready for that no
up cause let me tell you something just because your permission slips i don t have to have you in here you got that yes i don t have to have you in here cause apparently you re trying to show off for that cause that s what you re doing and that s not going to work for me
penta huh how many sides we didn t have penta we do quad 5 yes we are it what didn t we just do that and we just did it problem you got 2 of the same don t you yeah yeah 5 sided that s what you guys say
yes what could we say for a definition for a pentagon z a pentagon 0 what we could say
it s a polygon huh and it has 5 sides what else 6 and it has no it doesn t have 6 sides it has 4 so is a polygon with what
how many sides 5 definition of anything else it has 4 don t say 4 cause we re talking about 5 sweetie it has 5 angles huh what else
and it has 5 vertices vertices when there s more than one it s vertices that s pretty good it s a polygon and we could also say a pentagon right 0 cause a pentagon and a that s what a polygon is is a pentagon 0
it yeah what happened did you get shocked just a little pain in my arm but i m okay shock a shot shock what 0 a shock no huh feel better feel better i do feel better i m not sick i just had caught a little pain in my arm
shocked you just i get cramps in my foot you probably just gave me some growing pains going on with you tall so that s why y all get cramps in y all foot all that stuff cause you re growing yes it has 5 sides and angles we got that don t we
sides it has 5 angles and vertices everything that this is classwork 0 cause she decorated she made it into a i want to use a reminder 0 i don t care about that so if you don t have i don t care if she reminded herself as long as she know what the shape is huh i would i never yeah see
he was just waiting for me to say no you better not do it so now he s ready for it pentagon polygon so make sure you draw your what s the name your shape you all draw your shape for the pentagon how does it look i think it s already up here so i can get one i don t right this one right here yes
what i did hold it huh no you triangle want to stay you can t let it win you got to fight go away it wants to stay open it okay wait a minute let me try to take it off show him who s boss you getting excited ain t you yep
it looks like a cupcake it looks like a okay there you go
pentagon and that s a regular or irregular one it regular pentagon that s a regular pentagon you got that regular pentagon
no yeah how do you think a irregular one will look we re talking about a shape with 5 sides but not like that 0
all these sides are what regular well 2 sides of it look like they could equal yeah those 2 sides are equal like the downward side is uneven right they how do you think it s going to look doesn t a pentagon look like something on a house see it looks like this and a house that look like a house to you
yes that house come in like that at the bottom what i m just saying maybe this part of it house yeah i ain t seen no house come here like that that would be the irregular polygon that s definitely irregular house that that s the regular polygon yeah but it could be why why
because that s still 5 sides so you have that done back there right right yes cause it s still what cause it s still 5 sides but still 5 sides okay polygon we re going to do our listen up hey we going to do our irregular polygon and then we re going to stop here okay 0 i m going to have to turn to another page for that huh teacher s
why you whining cause now you don t want to teacher s come on it we already did the pentagon we got to do the irregular 1012345 did one already no you didn t 45 this is your irregular one
remember a pentagon is a closed in shape that has 5 sides polygon so this is our irregular one
remembers let me hear it from everybody factors factors and what kinds of things did we learn about factors factors what do we know about factors anything you know about factors yes if you have 2 factors you get a product okay
that anybody else know what do factors come in factors they re composite say it louder so they can hear you prime and composite prime numbers and composite numbers composite what do i mean by a prime number come on folks prime numbers that s a 5th grade sol em what s a prime number
when you can only multiply by one and itself to get to get what to get itself to get the number the number you re looking do you agree with her
g it has 2 factors and times itself will equal only one number all right it sounds like similar to it
d it can have only 2 multiples 2 multiples no no more than 2 like 2 products 2 products all right
what answer answer to that multiplication problem we don t want those numbers to have more than one what product product cause that s the what i didn t mean answer he started out good that all prime numbers have what itself it has what yes
2 multiples 2 multiples do we mean multiples what it only has 2 factors it will only have 2 factors factors one and itself one and itself
brain all right prime number say it prime number will only have will only have 2 factors 2 factors one the number one the number one and itself and itself and that s it folks prime numbers one and itself
numbers 0 god louder they have 2 or more factors it will have 2 or more more sometimes it s no it s not will it only have 2
2 more than 2 if it doesn t have more than 2 factors it s not a okay now that s what we learned now we started looking for some patterns yesterday the boys wrote down the boys what were you doing odd a couple of odd numbers from one to 25 26 and we were trying to see if there were any patterns
what did you notice about those odd numbers again real quick boys they re mostly prime most of these numbers are prime numbers factors here are most of our prime numbers you 357 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23
all right so we can say most odd numbers are prime numbers prime numbers but we can t say all of them all of them
girls they re mostly what most of them are composite most of them most yes all right what did you notice that wasn t a composite number a prime prime why is it a prime number because it only has one and itself it has 2 factors
it well there s another number up there that i don t see anything factor yes you multiply one times one times one no what s that definition for prime number
how many factors 2 what s that definition for a composite number 2 i didn t composite the word was who s saying composite what is composite number
no does it have 2 factors like a prime yes tell me the definition of a prime number one all right is it a prime number does it fit the definition for prime
number it has more than 2 more than more than 2 no is it a composite number no nor composite it s special it s special okay but it s neither composite or prime
that number one say it number one is neither is neither prime nor okay all right after we did the odd even we started looking at some we were doubling some numbers just to see what they were okay and each group did certain numbers
then what i want you to do you turn to whatever your group is look at your numbers make sure you ve got all the factors cause there was some missing we put them in order yesterday after the taping me we put them in order because i figured you could see the pattern better cause we had em all spaced out
so we took care of that after the taping putting them in order from what you least to greatest least to greatest now what i m concerned about is i want you next to your number write down how many factors you see for each number and then see if we can recognize these patterns
factors some of you had some missing that check and see if there are any missing and check to see listen so like for number 5 how many factors do you see here
there i don t want to say equal but box it maybe so that you can tell number 8 has how many factors here 44 so i just want you to box it so you won t get it mixed up with being a what
for put how many you see how many factors after each number now see if there s a pattern make sure you check where are those 5 people the people that have 5 the 1st one you definitely had some factors missing
them i don t know if it was just you or both of them you need to check with your group see if they have the same factors as you and look up here cause there s some missing okay up there you have a chance to go fix them copying all right where is 2
2456 we missed one you all are missing well go up there and fix it okay it doesn t have to be on the end
it i have did you find it anywhere else that it was missing here anything missing i don t know i got the 12 what group are you guys group 7 right here and over there what number are you
what s missing right there 0 you see it out you re missing something what number are you guys missing the 4 and the 20 and and what else
we re still going and she forgot to put prime up there all right go up there and fix it guys 6 we re 66 yes i was behind the board 6 is that was the wrong one
0 well we had red yeah you see it here 6 people 6 people remember i asked you to put it in what order where do you see order do you see any order 0 you forgot to put that there and then that okay
quick yes ma am so we have time to we can see the pattern better if it s in order that it s just but we can see a pattern better 0 okay if you do it that way numbers okay do it as quickly as you you did fix it on your no no no
it okay cause made a mistake up at the board all right thank you 0 here they are
44s 0 wow 4s all right
factors you re missing one of them see if you can find out what it is yeah that s supposed to is it up there on which number 48 48 nope go up there you 3 go up there
missing all right you find it okay all right okay now did you put how many were in each now will you guys go back and box how many you found in each one did you find your mistake
do and that s the only place you need a 2 really 140 you put a 2 in 28 56 yeah think about this me why would you know that 56 i got a 2 i got a 2 why do you know 56 has a 2 cause it s a even number there look at all the even numbers
this put it up there they can go with excuse me it now will you box how many factors you found
him make sure girls that you box how many factors where where we missed 12 on 24
okay sweetie if you put it up here it s going up where the 12 is 48 there you go came to the rescue
box you re counting your i thought they were missing one of them your things all right now okay box the amount that you you all have got to stand this way cause they ve got to come through all right i need how many
no i don t want it where it s jumbled in with the factors because then it ll be confusing i was going to see that s 2 this that now you all have to do it on your paper 1st no 66 okay and 12 go do it on your paper 1st and then come up
on okay you girls did do that on your paper okay all right why don t you look on your but you re not correcting i m telling you this is wrong you re missing something you re missing there s some more factors in 80 is it 4 i m not going to tell you do you have a calculator
yes can you divide 4 into 80 and see if it comes out evenly that eraser 4 you re missing i m surprised at you guys them all right when you re done raise your hand so i can check it there was only one group that didn t have any missing factors can you be sure that the you they re all they re okay
group no i ll take you took care of those 2 okay
fine sloppy handwriting okay you guys 0 hold on
it s hard to read somebody can be writing the erase that word factors
through i know but we don t have a can i borrow the eraser here excuse me okay no that s right use the sponge that s all right it ll 0 it s dry but it ll take it off all right you got one more minute and then we have to stop
marks a lot or no please don t use this yesterday 0 yeah i don t see but 2 boxes up here boys
up where s the permanent marker we re good to go
10246810 see you all should have put all right this is you ll be all day with this hey this one is fine okay all right we need to stop i ll put this one up yeah huh wait okay thank you here teacher w
it go back up and look again okay see that s what they re trying to discover counting correct excuse me
one box them see if you see any pattern you re going to report now make sure you ve boxed how many factors you found discovering and then see if you see where it might have been a mistake
see if there s a pattern excuse me me take care of your pattern do you see a pattern them adding one no
i m just putting up the number of numbers 0 i m wondering do you guys have all the numbers here the factors here this okay divide that into that and see if that s a fact okay there s a factor
it me too the 4 see and how come you know 2 should be there you missed that in all of them you guys missed that we just got i had been here and told somebody told me why is 2 always even numbers what are those numbers 2 will go into what are these numbers here
even they re what you all missed that whole thing number i gave you guys the easiest one and i shouldn t have done that
i don t know how i ended up giving you the you re some of the best ones in the math and i give you all the easiest one through you re missing something you guys figure out what s missing on and there are 224 wrong find the factors of 224 cause they don t have all of them
we fixed all our mistakes we definitely think but we re not sure all right something is still how do you figure this is 8 factors where do you see 8 where do you see 8 it s 4 you wrote that i didn t write this you wrote it me whoever wrote it the whole group is what
these 12345678 okay can i make a pattern out of no other has anyone come up with their pattern
if their particular number has a pattern up okay okay all right make sure you get a little thing for being kind to her 12 that was can you go put that up there for them cause they didn t do it in red
nope did i give you guys a fair chance to find all your factors didn t you don t think i gave you a fair enough chance to we got no color wouldn t it here pink ouch that hurt they re missing another one there s another one missing
there s another one missing on that last you re not getting okay group find the other number one well sweetie that s not right you did something wrong what did you divide by did i did 16 divided by why would you divide excuse me
you re going to divide 16 by the number number divide divide 200 into that excuse me i asked you to see if 16 goes into 224 so how would you write it 224 divided how would you write it
224 224 divided by divided by what 16 that do you have the number 14 up there 0 do you see 14 up there anywhere 14 if you said the numbers are wrong you put it in and so all the that s what didn t i say that
down now this changes me hey somebody this changes so 123 okay
changes now if you don t get it up and get it changed i m going to count it against you talking i m going to wait did anyone find a pattern in their numbers
j 3 you doubled 3 yes you doubled the number 3 what did you discover 3 a multiple what kind of number is 3
the number 3 they come in 2 kinds of numbers 3 a composite prime why is it a prime number
cause no other number can get 3 because it can only go into itself or one okay prime numbers only have what 2 factors 2 factors and the number 3 only has 2 factors what are the factors
one and itself and 3 okay well we keep doubling 3 what other kinds now i m asking everybody to stop and we re looking at the number 3 everybody is looking at the number 3 the number 3 starts out as a prime
when i add another 3 to it i get a what kind of number 6 a composite a composite a composite when i double the 12 i get a composite when i get a double 40 24 i get a
composite now why do i know these are composite numbers j it has more than 2 numbers it multiplying can somebody help her out
something is there a difference with factors and multiples yes yes the multiples of 6 are 6 12 18 when you re counting by 6s factors factors and if you say multiples instead of factors you have made
yeah there s some kind of relationship in there cause they both have to deal with multiplying same you cannot say multiples when you mean factors factors that yes composite numbers will have more than 2
what factors factors the numbers that you do what with specific factors are numbers we multiply with they come in pairs we multiply with them
all right so what s happening even though it started out as a prime number if we kept doubling it what does it end up being 44 is what kind of number
composite composite did anything change here in terms of prime composite no they stayed the same stayed what
5 who had 5 prime because it only has 2 factors 2 factors 2 factors it you have a composite composite and look at the factors what 33 all right
look at 7 what does 7 start off as composite there s one more number up here that did the same thing started out as prime we kept doubling it and they became composite who knows what it is 2 the number what 22 the number 2 even though it s an even number is a prime prime number
that s why we know all even no except for 22 is not a composite number group talk to them so somebody else can report
baby but i didn t have to go through all the numbers did i you you got the patterns pattern it s counting by 2 what it s counting by 2 what s counting by 2s the pattern the pattern
you can see as you as you double look at this
factors 4 factors 64 factors 6 factors 8 factors and 10 factors 12 number see and this way he knew he had made the mistake that something was what
pattern what number did you miss good i like it that you found your mistake so you guys get an a okay because you found your mistake pattern it added a factor every every time you doubled it what happened
here 33456789 so if i doubled 246 to anybody know it real quick 512 no it couldn t be 400 maybe 5 no 492 is that it
okay if i 492 it s probably going to have how many factors good okay let me look at number 6 this was a number that we didn t look at here number composite composite and when we doubled it any pattern you guys saw
d we saw that all the numbers that we kept on like doubling they were all composite yeah we already said that
composite what did you learn about the pattern yeah i m talking about that what the 2 the numbers on the side like 4680 well what s here we all noticed that it was composite but because the 1st 3 that we re adding to but then we noticed that it didn t add anything on there are we sure we got all the numbers here
what would make this the minute it was going 46810 and you got 10 again what do you think what would you have done tried it again make no you re not going to add something that doesn t make what sense but i no i m going to go and what
8 all right we might have all of them could everybody please try 96 and see if there s more than 10 factors just in case 0 i see one that s missing one they ve got one 96 2 48 4 24 6 16 8 and 12
i see one already i missed one what s one you missed 2 i don t know they have 12 what about 3 yeah we forgot 3
one yeah yeah i asked well you didn t put it up here babe fix it
12 highlighter 0 but at least the highlighter will come off okay now what about this if this was 4 6 8 10 12 what do you think might be right here 14 so you think maybe they didn t what
see one 2 3 4 5 6 7 i see 8 pattern yes so if a pattern is going on and you don t see it the next time that makes you that s a red flag to say let me go back and check it check it out
tomorrow and what we re going to do with these numbers tomorrow listen we re going to make a prime factorization tree do we re going to take these numbers and do something with them okay and that ll be the end of the lesson tomorrow so those numbers these are the ones today i want everybody to figure out 192 cause they didn t do it right so fix 192 that s what everybody is finding now
14 so see if you find 14 of em okay we re this is math reading okay do we need to put that down it s that one what did he miss
what 2 okay would have known 2 would have been on 192
step 6 is the denominator does not change
down are you guys playing appropriately yeah did you guys finish at least one division problem
working now i want all of you to go and do number 2 all on your own you never finished solving number one on your paper yes write a number one up here so you know that was number one or circle it now do 2 a underneath of it following those steps solve that problem
it well solve it did why did you write it there sweetheart you erased the 20 that was under the 5
that draw a line and put a plus sign so you know you are adding it sweetie you draw your line and your plus sign is up here cause you are adding these 2 fractions right shhh shhh we would add 12 and 20
paper where did you get 12 and 10 right here 20 17 you did not i still do not get it
go miss c i know what to do no trade her places let us go
now i am right in front of you now here is not each one have different numbers they got multiplied by here 5 times what gives you 20
bottom 3 times what gives you 12 4 can i see this for a 2nd thank you now you did your multiplication sign here
4 what did we find our common denominator 0 20 so we are at the 20 here 20 5 here so what are we going to multiply the numerator by
5 so do that now add the problem up with it 5 just try it
no no you use the same number until you can not use it anymore and they have to end in zeros the only one that should not end in zeros is your very last number you use
do number 3 shhh i got 1720th boy and girls shhh do not turn around cause it is going to get you started
shhh get a new piece of paper and attempt it over answer shhh you have to set your problem up right
when your lines are not in the right place all your fraction bars should be in the same place for this row and then all your fraction bars in the same place for this row and then over here you put your line and your plus sign we are good keep going
so find the multiples of 9 and 8 shhh no boys and girls we are going to have some math stations today
the students that work with me we are going to go over how to do our fraction homework that we were supposed to do last night to review that well the rest of you are going to be reviewing simple skills that you were need to be able to do which is multiplication solve yes
table shhh this table over here is going to be wrestling multiplication shhh just the top that one right there sweetie this table here is going to be problem solving and you are going to start with problem number one
and these problems are really neat because it tells you that it is guess and check use but you must listen everybody pay attention cause when you come to this table you are going to need to know what to do you need to be able to use the 4 step method what is it asking
work now when you are doing this one and you pick up card number one the answers are on the bottom on the back of the card but you are not allowed to check the answer till everybody solved it so the answer to number one is going to be on the back of card one at the bottom
after you solve card one you are going to go to card 3 cause you do not want to do card 2 when the answer is right there bottom there is over 50 so you are not going to get to that many but you are going to do as many as you can and you are going to do the strategies that are listed at the top of them so are there any questions about this one
in fact i am going to shuffle them up a little bit so this way you get to use different strategies at is table you guys are going to be doing it is called 6 card division
exactly over at who is talking i am going to be going over fractions and how to play fraction fish now before each group is to begin doing any of their activities everybody in the group has to have their daily math review finished
so that means if you already have it done for thursday you are going to help the rest of your group get it done everybody you just need one copy obviously at your table because you can work it out on the paper you have
down shhh sit down i need you sitting down questions there should be absolutely no talking about your table unless it is about math
talking can you please go get a stack of the newsprint for your table because that is what you are going to work out your word problems on again so you will be able to put 4 problems on the one sheet front and back shhh you guys are comparing your answers for now
on the front page and if one of you do not have the same answer everybody has to work it out to help each other get it answers if one person does not have the right answer you are helping them get it because it is important that we make sure everybody understands it you and quit taking those pens get rid of the pen
ever shhh can you put another desk at the end right there from over there so that is where you guys can put your stuff on it shhh i can not find my miss c says you need one copy per table because the questions are right here
started you remember how to do the chunking division game not really i think i do stuff raise your hand if you remember how to do the chunking division game
leader and what you are going to do is you are going to use these cards instead of the other number cards put these over there on the counter behind you
ones and what you are going to do it is 6 card division numbers so you would flip over 6 problem it has to have 4 on the inside and 2 on the outside
to the goal is you want to have the smallest answer up here so everybody will make a division problem out of it and they have to chunk it so you are going to have to probably be the 1st time you guys do it you will all to do the same number to teach them how to re chunk so you understand shhh i really hate to break up that group back there but i see not doing anything
shhh sweetie it is right in front of you so you might want to pull a chair over by
let me grab fraction fish no sweetie just use 6 cards
it you only use 6 cards because you are all using the same 6 numbers but everybody can rearrange them differently 1st guys you should not have all this on your desk you just in case you need that
put that stuff down on the floor beside you for now shhh go grab my purple math book off the back table please i said you are never allowed to have any pens in my class i need them for correction no
no we are now in miss c is till the end of the day please stack these on my desk back there i have no life without them well you will have no pens in my class i need the noise level in a few of your groups to go way down especially is group before i split you up at individual desks last warning
shhh let us look at the 1st one you got it did not you because all you can do is add them i know she did not get it
i understand that we are not how did she get 72 that it does not tell you to multiply these 2 numbers together it tells no multiples
from i know mine that is what i got mine yes we can not do them that way ever because that is not the proper way to do it w miss w did not show you to cross multiply right cross multiply yes it is
fractions she did tell us to cross multiply no i already shhh no d can you grab a couple dry erase markers stop what you are doing that is not how we are going to do it
me where is your notes in here on fractions that we have been doing in order to compare and subtract and add they are right here our steps right
yes you do not have all of them written down cause we had a lot more than that you are not taking notes in class right i do but then i do not why it sometimes i leave it at home sometimes you need to keep it in class only going to spend a few minutes and then is going to go work out her math problems and show me all of her work
you are not using the dry erase board cause you are taking all these notes in here cause you do not have them so hand me your marker marker ready this is what you are writing down go boys and girls we are going to look at row b because we did not have to do row b
so row b was 2 thirds and 2 sevenths that is a big number but that is a big number look at row b sweetheart step one one and if you guys need to review your steps you might want to write these in your notebook step one shhh
i need your voice to come way down for me please shhh step one you have to find the common denominator
find the lcm the lowest remember we took these notes the lowest common denominator the lcd why did we just write that why did we just write that because you have to write it and that is going to be the lcd
it step 2 in order to do that we have to write the multiples while i am helping with this you guys need to start doing row b of each denominator
what if you already know that look at my closet towards the bottom right there should be a box with some tissues or a container of tissues in it what if you already know that well you do not cause you do not have them written down
no you have to show me your work sweetheart i require it so you are going to do b over you are going to do b down here here 2 thirds +2 sevenths start it right here at this little mark
board not until you have it down it i do know how to do it sweetie you came in today with all of your homework incorrect now we have to write the multiples of 3 and 7 so up here write the number 3 like this and then right below it write the number 7
and now i want you to write the multiples of 3 and i want you to go out 8 places shhh you should not be talking to any other group bye now do the same thing to 7
places shhh you make sure they are all doing it correctly and
you need to be doing it correctly like she is showing you now now you need to circle the lowest number they have in common
step 3 circle the lcd lowest common denominator show me the lowest common denominator
it did you explain to mom that we can not or dad that you can not multiply the numbers know did you tell him we have to that is good and he was okay with that so 21
good can i see your eraser sweetie now step 4
now 3 times what equals 21 7 so if you are going to multiply the denominator by 7 what are you multiplying the top by 3 so now write your new problems
step 5 would be find your new numerators and that is what you just did
the new numerators step 6 is add or subtract the numerators whatever the sign is
921s is not reduced neither is 621 simplest terms reduce add or subtract the numerators
same the denominator how do you reduce answers 2521 that is an improper fraction
number the denominator stays the same right so go ahead and do that
add your numerators shhh are you getting the chunking division are you chunking the division
division miss c what do i do for this one 20 over 21 they do not have anything in common right so then it is done i see 621 i did not realize where your answer was so you added it and you got 20 over 21 now in order to find and then step 7 would be simplify if you can
simplify if you can pretty easy right but i understand it reason so when mom comes in today you know we have our conference right and that is okay to tell her this
happy i was hoping to be able to tell her some really good stuff cause you really have been doing better since i talked to her the other day feelings do you think my feelings should be hurt no you do not think my feelings should be hurt when you did not to your homework right no no if you were the teacher and your students just did what they wanted to and not what they were supposed you would not be upset
it would be their grade it would be their grade me i want you to pull that b back up in math and i want you to make honor roll and you can get an a because you can do it but you are being lazy about it so i do not want you to deserve a c
a just think of how proud you would be if you earned that a be go do your problem the 2nd one in b on some paper yeah you can do it on a sheet of paper correctly i will let you go to a board
b what did you get for this one
54321 shhh put your thumb up if your table has completed at least one activity
that means you have completed at least one round of wrestling multiplication one word problem one wrestling division problem shhh you are now off limits to talking because the wrestling multiplication should not be talking well now i want you to go to the wrestling multiplication without talking
has your group started the word problem and you are now each solving it individually without talking and then you will compare your answers and discuss how you each got your answer shhh you and will draw 6 cards
use the same 6 numbers but rearrange them however you want to and you are each going to make your own division problem you have to have 2 numbers on the outside 4 on the inside done if you can work with and on the same problem and why do not you have them start at take that same problem turn their papers over and you help them do it step by step
here let me see your work 7 what is your common denominator
420 you skipped so look when you were counting you did 6 12 6 is because i thought it was the same thing no
start it over for me cause i want you to get it right cause i know you can do this but is this a correct fraction 25 over 21
this what is the name of that fraction when your numerator is larger than your denominator improper improper and what do you need to change that to
me go from improper to mixed yes sweetie and you can actually check all your answers
they are right here for 57 mean 25 over 21 symbol divide 25 divided by 21
so what number goes inside remember we say it and write it just like we say it and if you got all of b right where is all your answers for b at sweetie 0 it is right here in the book 0 can you write them on your paper
okay did you get them right did you get them right yes i did can you write them on your paper
do you have all of b done yet can you write the answers on your paper and then compare with is cause he has it become the numerator the numerator i mean the denominator no
what number is your denominator on your problem this so what does this become number so now when we look at this problem what do you notice about 4 and 12
do write that down and then start the next one form one and 4 twelfths what do you notice about 4 and i am sorry it is 421 huh write that answer down for which one is that number 2
down number 2 sweetie for this one which one did you do next i just did this one well go ahead and write that answer down and i want you to go do number 2 in your notebook i want you to do one more for me in your notebook and then you can go to a board
just cause you got a little confused on that step do this number 2 for me
i just asked how many you started that is all so now everybody should do the very 1st one and then see who is the winner of the 1st one
out of the whole group out of the whole group how many word problems 1st one
yet we are working it out right if you are completely done go ahead and check it and see if you got the answer right you can flip it over and look at it but do not tell anybody else
no now that you know what the correct is you should go back and rework it anybody i hate my allergies really i have been sneezing my head off all morning
work i had to take an advil advil that is for headaches i had a headache but it has gone shhh but you are not done what do you notice about that problem
21 it is an right and is it allowed to be no keep going until you find one in common what comes after 56 there you go
shhh are you getting it you understand the chunking after you are done check your answer on a calculator
and if your whole number is right you should be okay cause the remainder will be different cause they are making it a decimal do you understand why you got it wrong you understand what you did wrong now do you understand what you should have done
shhh and you did the 4 square one what are you working on now there she can just pick up with the 2nd one
finish can we play fraction fish now and can go ahead and pull the next card and start it comes back what is your answer
72 you are good can we play fraction fish well how many on your homework did you get right
page so i am going to need you sweetie to take your paper you can take the whiteboard and i need you to work out all of a c and e for me and get the right answers go miss c is this too long no
long i always do it this way down the paper so this way i have enough room ready i am going to read the answers to the 1st page and then we can hopefully pull out fraction fish i want you to check rows a c and d with me
a ready a is 17 over 20 number 2 under a is 61 over 72 out and number 3 under a is 13 over 15
and c for 3 is the whole number is one and the fraction is one over 20 e number one is 3 fourths 3 over 4
number 2 is one is the whole and then 7 over 12 is your fraction sweetie i am going to want you to work these out on paper cause that is too many in a row those and then the very last one under e the whole number is one and the fraction is 47 over 63
d please rework those out on your board to show me you know how to get to the right answer shhh how many did you miss 0 good job
69 you guys can go to page 69 too i am going to read the answers so that we can see how many you missed hold on do i did this well then you just keep working on the 1st page 69 shhh we have to bring our voices down cause some of us should not be talking
did you get your whole number right we both got it wrong you did not get the whole number right redo it it was 3 zeros and 1371 1371 did you get that part right the whole number 0 and your remainder huh
check can you check their division problem and make sure they put in the calculator right please ready one one a is 14th one b 5 is the whole number 40 i am reading the wrong one
4th b number one b is one half one c is one half one d is 25 over 56 and one e is 2 ninths you need to go back to your 1st page and work them all out in here
home i forgot all the directions were right up here d and she did the same thing so i started doing that no you need to follow like miss c 45 here put it on the table sweetie so i can see what you are doing
what 6 done you only did 6 it and the only one you got wrong is
it and you need to finish working on the others that you have not done one none i got my answers right but i just need a remainder so can you help her show her what her remainder would be
shhh can you show her on her problem where her remainder would be
what was the 1st one the 1st one was 15th you just did not simplify it so you need to you just need to take it back and simplify it no you have 6 and 30 what do you notice about both of those numbers they are both what yeah but you got to keep doing it till you can not do it anymore
if you would have did it again 0 i would have got if you factor 6 and you factor out 30 do the factors how do you multiply to get 6 no we need to go over the factors
can i see your whiteboard when you simplify give me your eraser here and your marker when you simplify you have to remember do it on your board 30 when you simplify you have to factor out
multiples simplifying means factors not multiples 18 factors are the numbers that you multiply to get 6
next 2 times to get 6 2 times what 2 2 times 15 2 4 times what comes after 2 on a number line
no add up 3 +0 is 3 right 3 can go into 3 right so it goes 10 what comes next 6 what is the greatest common factor 6 teacher 6
so that means just like the other one you do backwards instead of multiplying you are going to divide by the same number 6 6 divided by 6 if you have 6 friends and you have $6 and you are dividing that $6 between your friends how much does each friend get
one it is the opposite because remember one times 6 equals 6 5 so when you are simplifying you have to find the factors so work out the other one that you need to simplify up there
your 3 sixths got the right answer shhh after you guys check your answer did anybody get the wrong answer yeah did they work it with you to show you how to get the right answer
c shhh please restack the word problems can you please do me a favor together you guys are not moving but we are going to move your activities yes please put all the numbers back in the baggies all the game sheets together
is group shhh did and do a problem it you have to simplify it sweetie listen one group is moving cause you can do other stuff on the back
boys and girls 543 all eyes on me shhh pencils down now moving i am going to pull is group back here is group is going to go there and do the division the chunking division
pick up your cards take them to multiplication leave those on the table i will have come over explain the game to you and then she will go back to her own table cause you are only using 6 cards number i should have no talking if you would like recess
you and you guys are going to have extra homework tonight correcting and fixing and finishing what you did not do please stop and go back to your group now quickly come on
you shhh come on sweetie please put the marker down shhh i really like how quietly is group is you are part of that group so let us keep that group quiet sweetie
job you understand it now division shhh your group is very quiet cause there should be no talking please go over and explain the word problem cards
quickly and then go back to your seats boys and girls are you ready to go over your fraction packets one did you fix yours page one
in order for your group to and look at miss c in order for your groups to have recess today they have to be very quietly working that group also in order for your group to have any recess i need you very quiet
whispering if i hear you over here that is too loud shhh you are only no no no listen you guys are not getting 6 cards a piece it is cards for the whole group
0 you use the same 6 cards and everybody makes their numbers different the way you arrange them so spread them out sweetie so everybody can see ready going over row one a look at your paper put those markers away
away you need your pencil because you need to mark next to them if they are right or wrong packet cap those markers tight please and then we are redoing the ones that are wrong so you can rearrange them any way you want to what i suggest the 1st time you guys do it everybody do the same problem
compare your answers and then if you all get them right then you guys can move them around so everybody do the same problem 1st ready and you are just going to put a little x beside it if it is wrong 20 put an x beside it if it is wrong
yet i need to be able to see it so please unfold your paper 72 you just added that is all you did you did not do them either right
a 3 13 over 15 i have 13 over 15 right here no this one you got and this one is wrong too sweetie change it
wrong number c ready 35 2 c the whole number one
the whole number is one and the fraction is 430 fifths c 3 the whole number is one the fraction is one over 20 at this point in time we need to work these out one at a time
and i believe we need to do these in our journals because we do not have enough to use the whiteboard so please pass all the whiteboards to who will put them on the counter behind us
and you need to open your journals so we can go over please put these on the counter behind you thank you very much open your journal go go get some lined paper so let us say we can keep them with our packets
we can staple them to em close your journal we will just go ahead and do it on some lined papers i believe all you did was add the denominators and the numerators together right you did not follow any of the steps that we did in class yesterday the same with so you did not try your hardest if you did not try the steps we did in class
sweetie that is not true because what did miss c go over how to do these right we do not add the denominators ever shhh is group needs to quiet down a little bit you are solving them individually using the strategy that is on the 1st card shhh everybody is doing the same card why are you going through the cards i am not going through the cards
you do the 1st one on top sweetheart i am doing the 1st one on top no we are not having excuses today paper we are going to write one a and we are following the steps at the top of the paper
out 3 fifths over 14th just like this now we notice that there is no common denominator right each denominator is different so for our 1st step come over halfway on your paper you are going to write down step one
step one you have to find the least common or lowest same thing denominator and that is your lcd
lcd step 2 right underneath of that
it to find the lcd you must write the multiples do you know what skip counting means
multiple learning how to count by that number like count by 3 is count by 2 is you know what that means that is what multiples means write the multiples of each denominator no the denominator
so now underneath of step one or underneath of problem one come back over here and i want you to write a 5 and a 4 just like this
it no other the very 1st card on top is the card you are solving i am asking you to stack them up nicely please
shhh there are a few members of your group that are not working up to expectations today so now i want you to write the multiples of 5 and go out at least 6 or 7 places and do the same thing for 4
28 what is the least common denominator
them now you come over here to your problem and we are going to set it up to find our new fractions
so step 3 is write the new denominators so the new denominator is what 20 so we write 20 over here just like this
5 times what will give you 20 4 so if we multiply 5 by 4 what are we going to multiply the 3 by 4 and that would make it 12 12 come on get your problem set up like miss c is up there right beside it
show her yours it needs to be set up just like this now one times 4 4 times what gives you 20 5 and if i multiply the denominator by 5 what am i going to multiply the numerator by
20 what is one times 5 5 step 4 was find your new numerator which we did already right
get well which ones do you think you are adding to find your answer the new ones right cause that is our new problem adding enominator where did you get a 4 from
12 you are adding everything on this side of the equal sign here find the new numerator which is 16 really what is 5 +12 5 +12 is 17
up 5 +2 is 7 and bring down your one and now what do we do with our denominator you does not change so what is our denominator
20 we just bring it down down did you get all these steps
right can i pause it for a minute okay teacher d
all right so i want to review with you fraction pieces and what each piece represents right so the last time we talked about the yellow piece green i want you to label what each piece represents
whole what s one half and so forth
up okay one whole is the yellow hexagon okay what s this one half one half is the trapezoid what s this 13rd 13rd 13rd is the rhombus
is 16th 16th okay 16th is the triangle okay now today i m going to show you how to divide fractions using these pattern blocks okay
you so if we wanted to divide one half divided by 3 which equals 16th how would we show that using pattern blocks
one half divided by . 3 . which equals 16th one half this is a half right
now we may have to share some pieces together because we might not have enough but one half divided by 3 . is 16th so if we have one half and how many of these do we need
01 half divided by 3 equals 16th see i m telling you the answer because i want you to think to see if you can figure out how they got that answer using pattern blocks 0 do you need do you change that to a times sign huh and 2 times 3 equals 6 and that equals one okay all right you think that s what they did
all right so 3 or 16th you think that they put a one up under here and like you said they cross multiplied is what we call it right you well let s do it the way that we know how to do it algebraically
so if we do one half and we change that which is the reciprocal the opposite of the division is going to be multiplication right times the same thing of 3 is the same thing as 3 over what one switch those around but you have to flip it right so that ends up being 13rd 3rd which equals 16th very good
so let s see how they get 16th how many halves go into 3 wholes . 66 right 2466 of them go into one half how many of these equal a half 111 what one half no
how many of these equal a half good so 16th of these look at this that and then if i lay that . and then that
okay so that the same so this is 16th so it says one half divided by 3 is going to equal 16th 16th you see that
yes because half is a 6th and 6 of these equal one whole okay
all right so let s see if we can model the same thing if we drew one half let s draw a fraction bar that has a half
and then we draw another fraction bar and it has 6s so you divide it into sixths does it equal 3
does 6 . equal 3 of these yes let s say i get my fraction bars out and you guys can use these too
so if we get out . get out the halves we re going to try you re going to use fraction bars as well so get out the half and then get out the 6th okay so we have one half
right which also equals 16th you see that and i told you something wrong these if we want to do one half divided by 3 how many of these equal a half 3 of these right
so that s one half divided by 3 and we know that these make a 6th which is 16th you see that okay so i want you to see explain to me how this one half equals a 6th on the fraction bar
again 333 of them right which make 16th right yes now tell me which one of these do you prefer to use better to understand one half divided by 3 the fraction bars the fraction bars you like the fraction bars or you like the pattern blocks bars all right so let s try one and you use either the fraction bars to show me the answer or the pattern blocks to show me the answer
whichever one you feel most comfortable with okay so let s see where s my eraser eraser we re going to erase and we ll do another i only found one go this time i want you to do figure out the answer 2 thirds divided by 2
2 thirds divided by 2 you can either use your fraction bars or your pattern blocks
and you re going to model it using the pattern blocks and the fraction bars
yes 2 thirds if you re using fraction bars then what pieces do you need to get out the thirds the thirds pieces right
2 now when we do the reciprocal of 2 thirds and we do times is it going to be 2 over one or one over 221 half so which fraction bar do you need to get out
now what happens if you put this because you wanted to find the answer
3 times 3 you get 3 sixths +16th equals what what 22 thirds 2 thirds let me see if i m explaining this right i might not be explaining this right what s the answer to this
2 what s going to be the answer 2 sixths 2 sixths it s simplified 2 sixths 2 sixths simplifies down to what 13rd now let s try it using the thirds this is my 1st time doing it this way and i m kind of having a hard time a little bit too all right so 2 thirds and then 13rd
which is the same thing as this and that equals the same thing right but our answer is 13rd which is equivalent so that equals the same right you see that can you model it using your pattern blocks let s see our pattern blocks if we do we re modeling it thirds the rhombus the rhombus right
so we have 2 thirds and then we have what
i think the pattern blocks are a little confusing aren t they yes yes and i think the fraction bars are a little easier to understand i think so okay so 2 thirds divided by 2 we re modeling
we ve got the fraction bars and we said 2 thirds divide by 2 which is one . 13rd which is one of these
it let s try it another way
so let s say that 14th let s try another problem 14th divided by 3
and let s say that if we were using the pattern blocks let s say that 2 of these represent one whole . instead of one
and one of these represent what if 2 of these represent a whole then one of these would represent what out 2 of these represent a whole one of these represent a half
that i just multiplied everything times 2
how many of these . how many of these twelfths equals a 4th 333 so there s our answer for when we figure out these fraction bars we re looking for this answer okay so we re looking for we go ahead and work it out 14th times 13rd equals 112th but we at the end if we re right we should get 3
which 3 of these make 14th you see that 3 so use 14th with your fraction bars one and how many twelfths do you need
111 now how many of these twelfths do you need to make 14th 3 of them 3 of them very good
did let s try that one again let s go . let s go back to the last one to see bar so remember we ve had let s go back to the very 1st one
one half divided by 3 equals 16th we want our answer to be 3 in the end right so we re going to pull out a half fraction bar and how many sixths does it take to make a half 6 how many sixths 033 does it take to make a half
3 we re getting the hang of this now it s not it s getting together this is something new that i m trying yes so how many sixths does it take to make a half
yes yes now let s try the pattern blocks if we have a half and we have a 6th how many sixths does it take to make a half 33 awesome now we re on a roll all right let s go back to 2 thirds
3rd 13rd right okay so when you multiply 2 thirds times one half you get 22 sixths which reduces to 13rd so we want our answer to be how many
22 so use your fraction bars 1st since you guys like those 1st
what 2 thirds and then sixths 2 sixths now how many of these does it take to fill up 42 thirds 44 sixths did we get 2 here
no umm 4 we got 4 sixths right 16th 2 sixths 3 sixths 4 sixths why is that ah . we didn t reduce it one so do you think that we should do 2 thirds and 13rd is that going to change
2 thirds and 13rd how many thirds . you should you guys should be seeing this how many thirds equals 2 thirds one
it how many of these thirds equals 2 thirds good now i know that one was a little bit confusing now let s go back to our pattern blocks 2 thirds we got 2 of these right
13rd how many of these does it take to make 2 thirds 2 do you see that yeah you see that okay now let s try another problem
before let s do 3 fourths 3 fourths divided by 3
that that . that . you can actually use these to check your work if you have the right answer then you will see that 3 of these fit perfectly into 3 fourths right blocks we have use fourths do we have fourths for our pattern blocks i don t think so we only have sixths halves and thirds so we ll skip over that part
does it take 2 of them
can you use these fraction bars to help you divide fractions think if you were at your desk doing problems would you use these you would or no you yes how would you use them
how would you use them if you had a multiplication or a division problem how would you use fraction bars
division you would do it would it help you bit okay did it help anybody else no it was confusing
all right you can go ahead and clean up
we re finishes i m not sure about this method i have to practice a little bit more i m not sure
it s something new that i learned and i m not sure if i really like it
so clean up your area and wipe your . table table down and when you re finished you can go back to your desks and work on . this problem solving make sure you wipe down your area teacher d we already did this what page 0
attention no i told you yesterday in the morning i wasn t here were are you guys done
done yeah with what with your conversations
please stop spitting you had on your desk either a blue folder a black folder a green folder a red folder or a red folder it had your name on it
if you opened up the folder open it up you will see this is the left hand side of it says journal problems you can keep stuff in the right hand side of your folder
does everybody have 7 problems inside their folder yes i am going to give each of you a stack of papers
papers do not do anything with the stack of papers until i give you directions
does everyone have a set of papers
yes awesome now mathematicians like albert einstein and me and you need to have a place to put their work
albert einstein did not write everything on a chalk board then walk away from it and erase it did he otherwise we would not know anything that albert einstein taught albert einstein kept journals lots of them i do not keep journals anymore
basis i am not solving problems on a regular basis i anymore to keep one do what i advise you to do is to pick up your stack of papers
fold the entire stack you have like a book
i am not going to staple these because my stapler is not behaving i will take them home and staple them just write your 1st and last name on them right there on that line
we are going to learn 9 new ways to solve problems okay solving problems is solving problems is solving problems
we are going to learn a new way of showing our thinking and showing our work
come on in the right hand pocket we will see a packet of problems please take it out of your folder
take the top sheet off put the bottom sheet back in your folder the top sheet has a level one questions
folder now i want your journal on your desk i want the sheet that says chantal on it i want it on the top left hand corner of your desk if you are a righty
if you are a lefty put it in your right hand corner so it is out of your way
now open the front cover of your journal please you will notice you have a page 2 pages with 9s
top on the left hand page everyone raise your left hand your other left baby good job on the left hand side of the page we are going to glue our problems
down right now with your scissors i want you to cut out it is just a rectangle cut out the level one problem right now and use your glue stick
we cut up level one and put the rest of your problems back inside your folders put those back in your folders now okay you do not need those now
put those questions back in your folder hold on
folder then i want you to put glue on the back of your level one problem and let me model it for you before you do it
i want you to glue it down on the purple sheet at the top i will staple it my stapler is not handling anything that is the issue i will staple them for you
good outstanding all of the extra problems should be back in our folder
job now the problem number one gives you step by step directions of what you are going to do chantal had some apples
i can hear you already because my darling children in 7 weeks it is spring break
the rest we need to practice okay chantal had 11 apples you are not going to have multiple choice questions on a large portion of it you are going to have what is called technology enhanced
answers you are going to have to type the answers in your computer there are going to be multiple correct answers on some problems we have to become very good problem solvers this is another way
that now we have got to look at multi step problems and all that fun stuff horses how many apples did she have left what are we talking about
c subtraction so down here on your number one problem for fill in the blank what is left of chantal is apples now step 2 is to draw units
we have been talking about unit this and unit that when we have been talking about fractions bars how many bars do i need to draw 11 so over on the right hand side of your paper next to the level one problem you are going to draw the unit bars
3 on the white paper
on the level one problem yes on the level one problem you should draw 11 rectangles on the white paper
okay write the numbers from the problem
4 does it matter which end we go from
we gave the horse 4 apples so we need to remove those 4 apples 4 what is the equation 11 -4
know one 2 3 4 5 6 7 left 7 circle your 7
sentence chantal had 7 apples left
all the problems need to be answered
period there is one there
paper you needed to show all of this work over here baby all of this work should have been on the white side i said on the white paper so you needed to do it over on here
no you were not okay wait a 2nd all right do we all have this
folder get out the level 2 problem
did you glue the level 2 problem down like i asked you to do okay are we ready
yes it is going to get more complicated the higher the level the harder it is but if we use our skills our life will be much easier
okay remember all your work is going to go on the white side of the paper
paper put your level 345 and 6 into your folder
problem kirk had some eggplants in his vegetable garden he had 25 plants and 36 plants are left how many plants did kirk begin with
25 what goes in the 2nd box 36 add them together
what is 25 +36 61 plants so what should our complete sentence be that answers the question
s kirk began with 61 eggplants no
you are not writing on the level 2 problem you are writing everything on your white lined paper
crazy baby your work needs to line up with your problem and this looks like it is a level one problem you have got to move it down for me okay just so i can see what you are talking about
okay you are going to be given these kinds of problems to work on every single day
i can hear the thoughts now
we have enough now this is what i would like you to do right now
i would like you to take your journal put it in your folder
pocket close your folder up
who can tell me what this tool is
protractor it is a protractor what is the job of a protractor you hold it on the hole and chop up cheese with it
no i could do it but that is not what it is for no no
we are going to use it to make triangles but i need everybody to do something really quickly for me before we get into using our tools i need everybody to quietly stand up okay
now i would like you to show me what a right angle looks like
show me an obtuse angle you showed me a straight angle
he is going to teach every one of you how to read this lovely protractor now before i put any protractors in your hand we need to look at the big protractor
say that again what is that thing called
arrow not an arrow not it is a degree line what is that called on a ruler the square the scale
the scale reads on the outside all the way to 180 on the inside it reads from the left side from 0 to 180
that is because when you measure an angle you measure the openings i could do a very cute one you want a cute little angle
now this angle is opening to the left so we read from the left hand scale that starts at 0 this angle opens to the right so we are going to read just put your scissors down and pay attention
we are going to read the scale that opens to the right
this angle does not matter where it is from because it is exactly 90 degrees i can flip it either way and it is still exactly 90 degrees but it does not make a square it makes a circle it is a square corner
if you add in another 90 degrees here you get a straight line 180 but if you add another 2 90 degrees a full circle 360 now let us look at how this is numbered
scale just like on a ruler you do not have every single little number in between no we have little short lines which are your ones funny are you going to live
sure i do not want any casualties today
gore i have spiderman all right so we have these little tiny marks here that are the ones
halfway between there is this one mark that is a little bit longer than the others 5 no way
the super long ones here are 10s
we will use them to measure angles
all right there is no more conversation it is no conversation
you can not sit there there sit here
me the children sitting at is table and at is table shockingly are running their mouths and it needs to stop
you you do not need it because the test is online
we are going to have to practice it
please hold on they need to be on the side and all facing the same way
way you are right okay now the vertex of the angle is where the 2 rays come together i need you right now to circle the vertices in all of the angles
you circle where the 2 rays come together and all of the angles okay are all of your angles facing the same direction
protractor hold it up and look at it can you read the numbers or are they letters if you can read your numbers they are the right way notice in the middle you have a hole
hole it is like the crosshairs of your videogames crosshairs you know when you are finding your target now you are going to take that hole and put it over the 1st vertex of that angle
now you are going to take these little lines and line them up 0
problem can you read where the line segment is across the protractor no
we are going to use this straight edge to extend the line to line up on ab
put that middle 170 is above it
no above we are going to do the next one angle rst
fine can you read it it does not talk does it
165 it would be 15
angle it is exactly 15 15 degrees okay
it let me go get this
the vertex of an angle is where 2 rays come together no flip it over now pick up your protractor
if your numbers are backwards you need to turn it around
you are going to take that and put it over the vertex of the angle
so what you are going to do is take your protractor and line it up and make the ray go all the way out to the end of your paper
once you have done that and you have not changed the direction of it put your protractor back on d and line it up right on top of your vertex
where does line segment d cross your protractor is it going to be in the 10s or 170
way yours is about 171 172 put that
write 172 with the little bubble next to the 21 do rst
line segment rs
do we need to work with everybody yes we do look at me
me sometimes you re going to be partnered with and you re going to have to be nice to him i don t want to be nice to him when he s doing something when i m doing something and he just takes the paper then you need to talk to him about it i did give me 5 really quickly because we need to shut it down
today wrap it u and tell me in one sentence what did we learn today we learned prime numbers arrays composite and we can take it from there and move on tomorrow
dice class today we re going to talk about arrays and one of the things we ve been talking about for a long time are arrays
so i need some feedback from you of what an array is done you need to think about all the different ways you have done arrays all the many ways we ve done arrays we ve done candy boxes and we had to put we had to do if we did one row of 6 it was one x 6 one by 6 is an array and we also learned that if we have a one by 6 we in turn have what
we have a multiplication we do have a multiplication problem which is also called a what what are those called arrays but what are those multiplication problems called
t factors so we were making sets of factors correct yes we did candy boxes which showed us factors for which numbers 24 we used also i remember stars and circles
learn the day we had it on the board we had items in black and blue numbers we had some orange up there and we looked particularly at blue numbers numbers i think we talked about them and the blue one was called i know it starts with a p
number we discovered prime numbers and the opposite of prime composite so we learned about prime and composite and we may get to finish that today because we haven t finished that yet
here we re going to look at arrays in the world and arrays in our room and we re actually going to make an array with your stuffed animals which are here today because we needed stuffed animals because of your special treat if you remember now i would like you to look at this and i would like you to look very carefully at this picture because i really like this
we re going to get so used to finding arrays that you re going to start looking around the world and see arrays what is the title of that things that come in an array can you read that again please things that come in arrays so tell me what you see up there if i used this as a dbq what do you see up here
k what do you think that might be window so tell me how on earth an old building that has a window in it is an array because it has rows and columns would you go up and show me please
and could you write go ahead and take an expo marker and on the board write what that array is please 6 agree yes tell me what that means though
4 rows by 6 columns 6 rows by 4 columns once again i know you re excited but i need to make sure that we understand what is going on it is a 4 by 6 but i need you to talk to me about rows and columns
rows are going this way and columns are going this way so it is 4 what columns by 6 rows i would like to go to the next one the mini board isn t set up because i couldn t set up 3 things
okay let s look at this picture we have 2 different pictures going on here and we have a left picture and a right picture
i would like you to look at the left picture carefully and tell me what the array is for the left picture please one row of 4
4 what 4 columns one row of 4 columns agree disagree disagree i think it is one times 4 equals 4 means one times 4 one column and 4 rows thank you very much
picture there s a lot in that picture but there s one item there that s pretty cool array what do you see array there s a lot to look at there be it would be 3 times 4
what 3 columns and 4 rows okay and the way we can say that is 3 columns by 4 rows because would that be different if i had 4 by 3 several these are this is another really good array
we have another array and let s check out what that says equation i m much more interested in equations but i m also interested in what it has let s look at the left picture again and would you come up and show us what you re looking at and what the array would be on this one
that we had the 1st 11 of them was one by 41 3 by 6 and the other one was 3 by 4 ahead i m thinking it s the chips can you give me the equation please
means 5 columns by 3 rows s a row of 5 columns look at your rows 1st
3 no wait how many columns are there 3 columns show me what they are really quickly column 0 wait this so tell me rows 1st 3 say the word rows thank you by 5 columns good
okay same building probably the camera is further back so tell me what we have 4 i ve got to hear some rows and columns in there
2 say it 2 rows by 4 columns there you go we can even take this one further because we can look at every little window pane in here and that would be fun
16 so we would have 16 columns right by how many we knew there were 6 6 6 and 6
120 tomorrow when we do our double digit multiplication remind me of this problem and i will show you how to do this with an array with a very special one called open ended array one you should put it on the schedule that s a very good idea we ll do that in a minute okay
fun i think we might have one more picture but i m not sure arrays have you ever thought about chips in a vending machine being an array no so you need to start looking around the world and maybe our room and this one we have
and you think anyone can hear you there s 2 rows of 6 columns i ll put that on the board while i m over here
this that s where i want to end this one because i want to go to the next thing in a minute this let me just get it up
totals there we go 6 i would like us to look at all these numbers and really quickly i d like you to give me the opposite the commutative property the opposite of every one of these
4 there okay give me the opposite here 6 times 2 one 4 times 3 5 4 times 2
and in the middle like we did the other day only this time i m going to put it in green i m going to put the number in the middle as what we need to look a little bit in our review about prime and composite there s no blue up here
4 12 15 8 dbq so this is again telling me what do you see red how would you explain this to someone that walked into our room
portion time they re almost even that s 15 times a number so you mean they re all almost even k i would say that all the numbers in the middle are the products
good so all the numbers on the outside are class f i see that 12 you can fit 12 into 24 by multiplying 12
so 12 goes into 24 2 times then 4 fits into 12 3 times then if you add 8 fits into 15 but we don t want to add today though okay
yes so we have lots of numbers that it s almost like a jigsaw puzzle that if you keep putting them in they keep building and remember the other day we tried to find a product that the factor worked really well with so once again do we have any prime numbers up here i need you to remind me what a prime number is so you re going to need to remember i m from another planet and i don t remember
is how would you describe that to a person just coming in that doesn t really know much about it k i would say that a prime number is a number you can only multiply by a number once true be very careful with the words multiply and divide though because give me a number you think is prime
who knows a prime number no 24 has lots of factors so it s definitely not going to be a prime
4 let s check this out because i like what you guys are saying and i would like to prove that is wrong and then we re going to prove whether is right or wrong 24 remember we do this on our big 20 all the time anyway but let me do this this actually helps with the big 20
when you give me factors on your big 20 are you allowed to do an equation no so let s do we ll do 2 things 24 i ve got a lot of people that are not with me and they might want to help out 4 +12
5 why don t i put a 6 down because it would just be a commutative property of 4 times 6 that so how do i know that this is not prime me it has factors it has how many sets of factors 4
sets a prime number only has one set remember your shoes come in sets also called pairs so someone told me 4 4 2 times 2
no i do not because but it has 2 so it can t be it has 2 sets of factors okay 2 it s okay
one it would be commutative same thing work it s a prime number 3 remember 3 is the one the mathematicians are arguing over
3 we know 4 doesn t work
on now when you guys say it won t work you can t tell me it doesn t work things but back to what you said this is what i wanted to talk about
when you said it s a number that can t be multiplied by anything other than one i can multiply 5 by anything i want to in the whole wide world remember you can t divide you can t divide it by anything other than itself
today today we have stuffed animals here for a reason that many of you are not using correctly but i m hoping that most of you are using them correctly
okay we are going to make on this table here an array with our stuffed animals and this is going to be an array that we make with no mouths and the animals will just need to be placed there and you are going to have to figure it out because these people are all going to stand up and push their chair in in a moment
we re all going to be looking at this table and we re going to need to figure out what the array is do you think before we make this there is a possibility there is more than one way to make an array
up i don t know how many animals there are so i do not know yet what our array will be t we are going to just lay the animal down but these people in the middle are going to stand up and push their chair in and then i need you to listen to me
everybody needs to have their own animal because some of you don t have them listeners you need to pick up your animal and take it please please i need the people on this side to stand up and pick up your animal or whatever it is you have in everybody is going to people back here can push your chair in and stand up
we re going to kind of make a big huge circle around this table we re going to step back we re going to go ahead and place the animals on there with no talking and we re going to see what kind of array we come out with the very 1st time happen this is like the scientific progress process not progress the scientific i m using progress from your words remember
progress means you are moving forward we re going to be moving forward today with your understanding of an array and this is really cool because we don t know what s going to happen so without any mouths at all i need you to put your animal in an array there is no talking and we need to see if it turns into an array this is very much like when you make an array in the theater
animals i need all animals up here this there we go i don t want guys you need to put his animal where he wants it
there you guys are good we can t have you standing right here because you re right in front of the camera sweetie can you see see everybody here is going to step back back i want you to look at this
dbq i want you to look at this and tell me if this is a clear array and you need to raise your hands for this because we need to have a little bit of a discussion about this you re going to either agree or disagree and you re going to tell me why i said do not move anything so you need to put that back where it was
j i disagree why i disagree with the arrays i can t tell what can you not see clearly they re not together i need really good math words here
you hardly can t see all the animals we re going to step back some animals are tiny and some are big okay over they aren t in even columns and rows so if this were an exemplar like we re used to doing we wouldn t be able to work on it because they are not mathematically in columns or rows
think they don t have to be all squished together 0 so maybe if we didn t squish them together we can see rows the people that placed their animal need to come up and stand there array you have 30 seconds
no mouths i need you out of your chairs i am very impressed with what i am seeing start at this end
back scoot way back please day okay now i can see much better what i m looking at however i see a little bit of a situation if this is a perfect array stepping back you can see better if you step back
there s a remainder 0 my goodness it s a remainder okay i wondered if anybody was going to notice that means i need you to step back please i need all of you to stay back
it has to be a remainder because but would we put a remainder in the middle of an array row now i m looking at it from this end
you now i see an array k i was thinking since some of those are small you can put them together and make them when we make an array if the number is number one does it want to be number one
not i d like to know what the array is know this is an algebraic equation you re going to give me in a moment moment you re going to step back and many of you are going to look at this
number step back please i want to know what you are seeing b i m going to get about 5 people to tell me what they think it is and then we re going to go from there m i see a 5 by 3 with a remainder of 2
but can you have a remainder of 2 when you re multiplying do multiplication problems have remainders 2 5 times 3 equals 12 +2
it 5 times 3 doesn t equal 12 okay i like 3 6 9 12 15 did what did she count by 15 now when can i talk about a remainder in this array
at what point can i discuss remainders are there 15 here 17 divided by 3 equals 5 with a remainder of 2 good what did you divide by
okay tell me if is dividing like this or like this 3 tell me if he s dividing like this which would be we ll call this a row and we ll call this a column what is he dividing by row now tell me the math problem like this
this division problem 17 divided by 5 equals 3 remainder 2 3 isn t that cool
cool i m glad we had our animals here to do this today because i think it s pretty cool and we ll try to get a picture maybe later of this because i m not going to stop right now the next part of our lesson is going to be our how long how many game which we haven t done for a long time and some of you have done it a lot and some of you haven t ever done it are let me get this back up because your computer keeps going to sleep like children do sometimes
and we are going to need to refresh our memory about how to play this game board some of you really need to listen to what s going on you re going to play with your partner i m going to be giving you a partner and and i want to make sure we know how to do it because today i want a winner
so far we ve played this game and no one s ever really come up with a major winner okay so i need you to look at the board and i need to move if you would just move to a little bit different of a location that would be so helpful great you re good you can sit down in the chair please you re looking at this piece of paper which we re going to use
it i need anyone that can remember from 2 or 3 days ago when we learned how to play how long how many anyone that can remember what materials we need to play this game what this game is going to show us and how we get a winner need we need different colored crayons how many different colors okay 2 different colored crayons why do i need 2 colors instead of more
so you don t get messed up you you have 2 players you have 2 players so if you re if you get a factor set of 6 times 8 how many squares do you get
48 if your partner gets a set of 2 times one they have how much set the person with 48 is going to be the winner
s you re getting i can t remember the name of the maybe somebody can help you things no they were really cool by the way
they re the 10 rods actually what we re going to use today are cuisenaire rods because actually if you remember cuisenaire rods are all kinds of colors and all kinds of links important so your cuisenaire rods are going to be every group gets one bag
die and one paper do he rolls the dice and whatever the number that he gets you roll 2 times with one dice do you roll 2 times right away
while the 1st time you play the roll you get what what s the name of the game many the 2nd time you roll many so if i roll 5 what do i need to figure out of this bag
look i m so sorry but there s nothing with the number 5 in here you measure it 5 so whatever this is you get 5 what if i roll a 6 the next time
l you are going to get one piece that is i rolled a 6 so let s pretend like this is what i rolled my 2nd time i rolled i got a 6 and i had a lot of people i need really good attention on
k you would do the same thing you did on the other one except you would put it in the columns i think that s where we re forgetting what to do when i rolled these this one right here and right here i ll use my yellow one because i can see my number down here this one i rolled a 5 to start with and then what must i have rolled
3 the 1st number is how long the rod is and the next number is how many you need paper you cover and make sure you trace around it with your color points on the back of your paper you can do addition of points okay many because we re going to go into partners here in a minute and play that
yes are you going to choose the partners i am today going to choose the partners out your paper will look like this without any other writing other than just a centimeter word on it this is a strategy game by the way and some people may not realize it because you want to cover the entire paper paper so you want to make sure you don t have any choice in what you roll do you
no you might want to use some strategy because guess what girls if we get if we started playing here and moved to the middle it may not work very well you need to use some brain wave strategy thinking where am i going to get the best place to place my numbers what raise your hand and tell me the shape of everything on that paper will be in the shape of what
a rectangle everything will be in a rectangle absolutely will you have it possibly will be a square which is a whole other thing we can talk about next time called square numbers wait will we have a remainder today eyes think about rolling a die
long think about how many and will we have a remainder
think i think we re not going to have a remainder because you do how much the 1st time you roll and you get that many right
again cuisenaire rods it starts with an f okay my partners today are going to be this is what you need to pick up paper they re all on the table and then you re going to come back and play with your partner somewhere in the same area that one of you sit
i know you re going to be all over the room and i m going to be watching what you re doing but i want to see what winners we get and then we re going to start a factor board with all the factors you guys created today that means we would have 12 pages of factors to start putting it somewhere in this room today and are going to be partners
and yet and and our animals will get moved eventually because obviously we re going to be using a lot of tables here
we re probably going to play this game i m probably going to time you for about 17 minutes and see where we end up so this isn t a we can play this forever and talk about nascar and talk about the race last night and talk about the braves and the falcons and all those kinds of things this is not a stuffed animal talk i want to beat my partner because i want the most boxes
it stand up and get your material please and get organized yes are the boxes going to be connected if your partner rolls one and you need to decide strategy wise if that will be a good strategy
away where s your partner are you 2 partners you 2 are partners you need to make sure you have a colored pencil 2 different colors make sure you re both ready
okay who s your partner right here
you how many people don t have a package of rods one you and
rods make sure they don t get mixed up with any other rods anywhere else your animal you re not bothering the animal we re not playing with it right now who s your partner
who s your partner hurry up
what did you roll a 5 and a 21st give me 5 for just a 2nd now that we re organized
one of the things that is real important in this game and one thing that s really important do you roll it one time and immediately get a cuisenaire rod that works again you do not make 2 rolls you should not have 2 dice
do you guys remember how to do that make sure you roll one time then fix it then roll another time then fix it ladies yes
rolled so this one fits 4 again you have a one so that s all you get so you will draw a line around that and inside you will write 4 times one equals 4 and then it s his turn
other at the end you can have you can reuse these but you can also set them there and know people what is the reason we want to win
most not really the most arrays because you re going to have an even number of arrays what what are we looking for factors okay
score what are you doing here like this is a 3 and i need to see it as 3 and 6 and this is an array is that an array
works i ve got 2 girls unfortunately that are not working
t we need to get started gentlemen give me 5
one of the things when i m walking around that i should see is everything on your paper is in the shape of what again rectangle a rectangle if it is not a rectangle you have not made what
array you have the same color way too much of the same color this i need your attention do you see theirs like that okay let s get a piece of paper and start listening keep it together
we re not dividing them do go ahead and roll and start tell me about it one that s what you got
one what is your array sorry you don t have to keep them on opposite sides guys advantage you want the most orange
yellow you don t have to color them in and what i really need here is an equation here 4 by 5
20 keep track of that you okay next you re black and you re green rolled i don t see it
rods and i need to see the rods out i need to see more rods them i need to see your rods on here
ladies how are you doing over here i need your equation inside and your rods on here thanks you should only be using one
how are you ladies doing one of the things we don t want to do is divide it up like this
them what are you doing you are going to be to show me these this i need some rods on here
rods okay here actually what you need to do is put this in here
you need them in there not out there on them checking to see if it works i should see this full of what it s supposed to have
i should see rods on this paper here wait a minute it okay
this there s no what there s no more yellows okay
fine these stay on there you guys need to make sure yours stay here and yours stay there
i need to see them on here 5 eyes on me just a minute this is really good
seeing some of you are telling me that you can t keep putting cuisenaire rods on raise your hand and tell me why you can t keep showing me why can i walk around the room and see a paper full of cuisenaire rods i need to have your attention full i have some really good strategists in this room
l i would love to see that but what have you guys run into as far as what have you girls ran into you girls ran into a problem and i said you can t do this because you didn t show me the real number because for 5 we ran out of yellow so this is another lesson i can add to another day
how can you make a 5 out of cuisenaire rods worry i m going to give you 2 minutes at which time you re going to stop and add your scores time yellow doesn t work very well
you can t see it very well how are you doing good i like the way you girls are putting the opposite we don t have to do that on this game just one equation in the rectangle is okay i like what you re doing though
well i need you up here please i like the way you guys are figuring it out you can only roll once
you haven t done anything you need to roll it again
bar you can play around with them now are we finding a rectangle or array didn t i tell you to find the 5 bar
5 if there s no numbers on it would it be a good idea to pick something and see if it works it so how did this help you
tell me how this helped you
that good job that s called using your brain yes there are 5 rods
do they have to be in the bag or can they be someplace else you re going to need to take whatever rods you re looking at and put them on the paper it has to be 5 sweetie you have to find the 5 bar
that s the whole purpose of the game to find something worth 5 you need to look all over your desk honey all over your desk would you look all over your desk please can you help him
5 i know we re doing this a lot but i need all dice down all rods are down and all eyes are on me you re not going to have a lot of time to do this the next thing you re going to do is this and i know a lot of you didn t finish the game okay on the back of your paper and thank you
i asked for pencils to be down and dice to be done on the back of your paper you need to take the product all of your products and write them down in a column left 0 how do you need to line them up
place value i m so sorry in your place value and if we don t get it done today we re going to add them tomorrow but everybody s going to stop right now j i really need people to listen s you re not listening your numbers will be down one side
another we ll start adding and you guys can use do you know how to apply numbers with 10 10 everybody is working on addition right now and i will come around and clean up the mess
now help them out
all it is not good for time if you re not doing what we need to be doing on the back
you need to find it sweetie these are from all the other places thank you you re supposed to be helping girls you need to be adding
i need you to help him i need you doing what you re supposed to be doing thanks
much whose is this girls have you got it added then we re not talking you re not helping at all
you yes please did you get to ask her
do you mind going over and asking if i can have that remainder one book
chair i didn t tell you to sit there i keep sending and they keep telling him they re videotaping but i m pretty sure they re done with the book
you writing this i m sorry you clear your tables please
the books put them in an empty seat if somebody is not there at your table or put them on the floor
directions i see a table that s ready
i see 2 tables that s ready ants what y you re going to do is take the paper clip off and then i m going to come around and get the paperclip from you
you do not get to keep the paperclip bend it open or move it apart and ruin it when you do that it ruins the paperclip and it can t be used anymore
tables yesterday you all were really on and listening and doing well for the video and today you re talking
desk when i say clear everything that means clear everything come sit over here chair i don t have missus
paperclips scoot over in your area and you scoot over and stop whispering and talking or i m going to kick you guys out like i kicked someone out yesterday ants yes spread your ants out
have ants are they stuck together
together they re on that other table over there 25 how many do you have 26
25 okay you know what would be great see stop
yes ma am you should have 25
25 if you have extras or not enough i need to know otherwise let s be quiet yesterday
what putting things into equal groups it equal parts one the divisor that s one of the numbers the divisor the remainder well if they re in equal groups are we going to have a remainder
factors that s multiplication what s the answer in a division problem head it s not the answer
the answer in a division problem quotient raise your hand
you re going to be maneuvering your ants in front of you quietly as you listen to the story okay the story is called a remainder of one
about thank you what do you think this story can be about
i think it s going to be about something that has a remainder of one and people like find stuff and they have an equal part of it and a remainder
math division so maybe this story might be about division and having something of the remainder like a leftover right if you go to a restaurant and you don t eat all your food you have leftovers and that s the remainder of your food you can take home
way remainder of one down that s better it is for me
the story of joe just might explain what happens to numbers when they must remain after division and they re left behind as lonesome remainders it seems so unkind
so this is joe joe is a bug hence you have bugs
arms down by an orchard of old apple trees the sunshine felt hot about 90 degrees so insects all scurried for any cool shade from mushroom or leaf
parade so there s a parade going on with bugs a bug parade the 25th squadron marched past the bug crowd bound and determined to make their queen proud the troop had divided by 2 for the show
each bug had a partner except soldier joe 2 see how they re marching in the picture by 2 rows
picture do that with your bugs rows look at the picture
picture 2 rows rows okay
space put the paper down you re not fixing it rows look at the people at your table and sit up straight
clip and table you must use all bugs so do all of your bugs fit in the 2 lines if they re each matching up with a partner
all right this morning in math we re going to go over mixed numbers and improper fractions last week we previewed it okay but before we do that we need to go back and review fractions all right and the vocabulary that goes along with fractions
all right the 1st part of our vocabulary we re going to go review is numerators all right and we know that the numerator is the number above the bar in a fraction okay and who remembers what the numerator actually does do it s how many of the whole number there is
it okay now when we look at the denominator the denominator is located where bottom the bottom okay the number below the bar in a fraction and here is an example right here e stays all the same okay it s the whole number it s the whole number is is it a whole number
it s talking about all of the it s how many pieces there are in a whole how many pieces altogether altogether and remember our numerator tells us how many pieces are shaded or how many pieces were eaten okay all right now this morning we re going to go and dive into the mixed numbers and improper fractions
and the reason why i reviewed with you guys because we re going to have to use the correct verbiage when we re doing this next subject area okay we re going to have to know what our denominator is we re going to have to know what our numerator is we re going to have to know what the whole number is for okay and in order to do to work those out we re going to have to use the correct verbiage got it
all right i m going to move these over and if you need these to review to remember as we re talking about denominator and numerator i know sometimes we can get it confused but i will leave this up here as a reminder so you can see okay now this morning we re get start talk start talking about mixed numbers all right
last week we said a mixed number is a number that contains a whole number and a fraction and if you notice here okay our examples we have 2 whole pieces and only 13rd is shaded okay so we have the number 2 and 13rd all right
okay in order to do that we have to go back and dig in our math repertoire about order of operations operations okay and when we did order of operations we had a little catchy phrase to help us remember what to do when we re doing order of operations
okay all right okay with that being said with 2 and 13rd all right the 1st thing you have to do is take your denominator all right multiply it by the whole number and then we re going to add our what is this number called
numerator and if we set that up as an expression it would be 3 times 2 +one okay and we put this in parenthesis okay looking at that and knowing what order of operations is how would i solve this problem what s the 1st thing that i do
3 times 23 times 21st why can t i start with just one because it you re supposed to do the parenthesis and then the multiplication 1st before addition okay good job cause you remember in our phrase know that parenthesis comes 1st so what we can do is go ahead and make that little right there and say 3 times 2 is what
6 now bring down the rest of our equation all right and then we say 6 +177 and when we reviewed last week we have to turn this into a fraction right fraction we re changing this mixed number into an improper fraction and we go from here now what s going to go on the bottom
3 the 3 because it s the denominator all right and there we go we took our whole number and changed it from a mixed number to an improper fraction remember an improper fraction is a number greater than its denominator
page no it s just stating that these are 2 this is the whole number and then you have your fraction part okay also with this we learned that they re also interchangeable right we can take an improper fraction and turn it into a mixed number but before we go back over that again we re going to do a few more examples together okay to see what you guys remember all right
and i m going to move these over up here in case you guys need to review as you re working out some of the problems how many of you want to do one more together and then we ll see we can do like activity to see what you remember and see if you can work it out on your own
okay i have 4 and 3 fourths okay 4 and 3 fourths remember denominator times your whole number plus your numerator numerator okay and remember now we have to set it up as an equation
so we say 4 times 4 in parenthesis +3 okay what is the 1st step that we do p 4 times 44 times 4 and why are we doing 4 times 4 cause the parenthesis comes because parenthesis comes 1st 16 bring the rest of that problem down it s 3 +3 16 +3 is what
19 and do we just leave it like that denominator 44 because we knew we know that the denominator stays the same the same in the equation all right how many of you think you re ready to do one on your white boards by yourself
okay okay let s do 346 now remember you have enough space on your white board you don t have to cram it in
space it out so you can actually see what you re doing and do it step by step
work the way i did it on the board step by step show your work so i can see what you re doing and if we see that you re having any problems we can go ahead and fix it together
and check your work when you re done
step and if we get confused about the order of operations you can always put our little catchphrase on the side of your board to help you remember
don t forget to put your sign right here so you ll know what you re doing all right so you will multiply this and when we come back to the now what operation do we use here
here already have your 3 here so you re missing a number that you have to okay i m looking around looks good
i 2 right here plus your times signs and your plus signs okay so let s go ahead and do that here the 62 and the 36 times 3 and then we go 3 the whole number plus the numerator numerator all right
do 6 times 36 times 36 times 3 multiple students +4 okay all right do i just start right here no okay tells us to do what 1st and i noticed as i was walking around some of us forgot about our order of operations okay
so with that being said i would like to see everyone write our catchphrase down the side on our board because as we re working these problems out we don t want to forget our order of operations and then we don t get the rest of the problem okay all right 6 times 3 is 18 and bring down the plus sign and the 4
4 okay now 18 +4 is 22 22 am i finished i put the denominator excuse me was talking
floor you put the denominator on the bottom of 22 to make a fraction okay what is our denominator in this 66 okay raise your hand if you got that all right now you know even if you did get it next time now for those of you who didn t get it raise your hand cause what we can do is find out what you did
okay maybe you had one little step in there that caused you not to get the problem okay what happened to where you didn t get the problem i just here i put 3 and 4 but it s actually 6 and 3 so what she s saying right here instead of doing her steps this way and drawing her diagram so cause we make a little diagram out of ours so we ll know what steps to do 1st
actually i m looking at hers and did you even do our diagram to help you no so do you think that would have helped you when setting up your equation mistake yes because it s the the denominator times the whole number okay
you see where you made your mistake do you want to go ahead and fix that while we re cause 1st i put and then i put +3 +3 okay so did you do your diagram to help you notice on both of those they said they had a little trouble getting the answer and it s okay if we get something wrong because we can work it out together and we can help each other out with that okay
but if you re when you re doing this you have to do the little steps in order to help you get the equation this is just a little diagram an easy way for you to remember what operations you need to set up 1st okay how many of you feel doing the diagram helped you when you started setting up your equation so what do you think you need to do while you re doing these problems
okay all right we can do another one since we had a few that had some trouble okay
all right so we re doing everything we re going all the way up denominator times your whole number and then add your numerator okay
here and i m noticing that some of us that didn t do our diagram had trouble last time they re actually doing their diagram and their setting up their equation
remember here you go again you ve got to do this times this plus this so you got this with the 3 all right raise your hand if you re finished
okay all right let s work this one out do multiply the denominator times the what number and then we add the numerator numerator okay
equation we have to do multiplication 1st right so say 7 multiple students times 4 or 4 times 7 plus multiple students one 28 and 28 +one is 29 29 and are we done
d excuse me our denominator 4 all right got it practice now what we re going to do what we re getting ready to do is we re going to work it out and we re going to lift our boards okay
and i know you guys get excited about that and you guys get ready to do the problem and lift your boards to see if we re all correct okay all right the next problem and we re going to do a few of these a few more of these and then we re going to start changing improper fractions to mixed numbers got it
problem are you finished remember we re doing improper fractions improper fractions look at your answer there okay
out i m going to say 5 times 2 +3 +3 okay 5 times 2 or 2 times 5 +33 okay 5 times 2 is 10 +3 13
okay now i said you just had a whole number there doesn t that just look like a whole number yes but we re doing improper fractions right we re changing mixed numbers into improper fractions this just looks like a whole number missing we need to turn this into an improper fraction okay who wants to help him out
that because it s not a fraction it s not a fraction fraction the 5 our denominator problem 5 so our answer is 13 fifths remember you just stopped right here okay
fraction don t throw the denominator away we need it okay all right now we re going to move on because i told remember what i said mixed numbers and improper fractions are interchangeable
so your numerator what s our numerator 13 and it s divided by our denominator denominator now we have to go back to division and remember our division facts right
just as we needed to remember our multiplication facts okay with the mixed numbers we have to go back and do division t 0 i just needed the you want to work it s okay we can work it up so we had to look into it and say how many times can 5 go into 13 or remember we have another way of thinking also what number times 5 will get us close to 13
okay since you called it out 2 anyway 2 times 3 is multiple students 10 10 i gave it away huh remainder 3 wait okay we re not done e is trying to tell us slow down we re going to do it step by step
13 -10 is 3 or if we re going to do it in place value order 3 -0 is what 3 and do we have to put our 0 there no so as we did division is there anything else to bring down no now when we re talking about it in fraction terms do we take the 3 and put a remainder right there
right okay so we take what s left over all right and use it as our what denominator denominator numerator numerator because what is our denominator denominator 5 and remember we said that stayed the same
it now we do use this yeah but why do we use that instead of 20 yeah the 2 is our whole number 0 okay that s part of our quotient remember in our division that s part of our quotient okay
all right so in order to check in order to check what do you think we do in order to check to see if our division problem is right because remember when we check division we use what to check division multiplication multiplication remember i said this was all interchangeable looking at our quotient our answer it s 2 and 3 fifths how can i check to see if this is right
h turn to an improper fraction we take our mixed number and turn it to an improper fraction it do our steps okay and we say 5 times 2 +35 times 2 is 10 13 and what was our denominator
5 does this number look like that number yes then we are correct remember how i said in the beginning we re going to have to know our multiplication and our division facts and we re going to keep practicing them throughout the year because you will see this again
and now we re seeing this when we re doing fractions when we re changing mixed numbers into improper fractions and improper fractions into mixed numbers okay all right let s do another one homework you want to do some of these for homework yes
all right let s do you want to do it by yourself or you want me to do it independence way to be confident about what you re doing
and when you finish working it out what are you going to do to see if you re correct multiply check it
check it thank you cause we always need to check our work to see if we have it done correctly no you do it the way that you can get it as long as you get the answer comfortable do you want us to check it too
okay you answered his question
check it and see did you check and see if it s correct did you take that mixed number and change it into an improper fraction to see if it s correct did you check it
hand can you step over there over by and help her out see what she s doing wrong trouble okay i saw yours l you re having some trouble did you check it
job all right we re going to check this one together services all right what is the 1st step that we do in order to change an improper fraction to a mixed number do 0 no is and and the only ones here today
okay you have it on your board don t be afraid i don t know how to say it in words so you need a little bit of think time time this lets me know you need to think about it some more okay
e divide you need to divide do you know sometimes teacher and bumps her head right and you guys have to help me out l you take the denominator take my denominator like that
and divide it with the numerator okay so our denominator is our divisor and our numerator is the what dividend dividend 0 okay now all right i need to know how many times can 6 go into 11 without going over
or like we said cause some of us came up with what number times 6 would get us close to 11 without going over agree yes all right one times 6 is 6 what do i do with it
11 all right 11 -6 is 5 do i have anything else to bring down 5 the numerator we make the 5 the numerator and the 6 is stayed the same denominator raise your hand if you got that correct raise your hand if you didn t and you need me to help you work that out
trouble okay all right erase your boards because i m going to have you work with a partner sitting beside you and i m going to be coming around monitoring if there are any questions and also i know sometimes you guys learn best from each other too and you also can find different ways of solving these problems you know my way is probably not always the right way okay
and sometimes you guys come up with some creative ways in doing you know different problems that i give you okay right everyone has a partner or across from you
partner okay you 2 can work together you 3 can work together all right you 2 you 2 you 2 and you 2 you 2 you 2 and across from each other okay that now you can use one board and work it out together
ahead and i m looking for those groups that are talking it out and i m looking for the correct verbiage when you re talking about it i want to hear some of that strong math vocabulary
okay i m going around checking these
together good job
he s just discussing over there they were working out the problems and he noticed that they didn t check their work and he wanted to be sure that they got it correct okay and sometimes we need someone in our group to remind us helping him tell him how to check it
okay and that s what i consider a group effort where you were weak he was strong and vice versa
what good job teacher do i press it again no press on
you okay i ve gone around and checked them you guys did a great job working that problem out and what was our answer on that one
2 now i know how you guys like to come up to the board make it interactive you guys want to and do problems okay so go ahead and clear your board because we re going to do a activity and you re going to have to use your boards you re not going to just raise your hand say 0 i know the answer you know in here you have to work it out and show your work before you select an answer okay
all right they re going to give us a problem all right 43 ninths as mixed number ahead 0 what should he do 1st
good all right do you want to come work it out i have to
you need to check your answer all right that s the number we started out with the answer was 4 okay
yes yes there you go correct now on this one they gave you a mixed number and they want you to change it to an improper fraction
they re mixing it up here because they know these 2 are interchangeable so they re going to mix it up
all right look at his answer
and raise your hand if you re still having some troubles with either one mixed numbers or improper fractions where is your where is your thing here all right did you draw your diagram that shows you what you need to do
so let s start over cause if you re having trouble here how are you going to correct it
okay do you guys agree
yes all right there 16 thirds and submit it
job okay if you would please turn our screen off all right now what i m going to do is put a few problems on the board so you can transfer them into your folder so you can practice these more tonight okay
i know we have we were reading some of this in our folder and you can use your folder as a resource as well because we have some of this information already in there but i m going to put some problems on the board so you can record them in your folders so you can practice these tonight again up we re not just going to have one way just mixed numerals or just improper fractions okay
teacher yes
who i turned that in to you okay i ll just put it right here for right now
okay how many of you want a few more
no i don t yeah i m good you re good
okay there s just enough cause we practiced this enough today to where you ll be able to go home and practice
now with each one i want you to show your work and check it i m only giving you 2 of each because you know you have to check each one and that gives you added work to that okay
all right now take your folders right now take your math folders right now not later right now and put in your homework binder cause i know some of us sometimes forget when we re working on math folders
you forget that you re using your math folder instead of your homework folder
binder you put your folder in your homework binder okay all right thank you boys and girls
we re going to review one more time our long division process we have our problem here 5214 divided by 4
this let s set up all of our friends so we can go ahead and start without any problems what should i put on the side to keep me focused
side dad mom sister brother and rover dad mom sister brother and rover so we have dad mom sister brother and rover
be multiply sister subtract brother rover repeat or remainder repeat or remainder d 4 into 5 does 4 go into 5 in this case multiplying 4 times 14 times one
d 4 put your line under s and subtract subtract 5 -4 equals one good next in the process we re going to bring down
m bring down rover and what does rover tell me to do repeat or remainder so which one are we going to do repeat or remainder repeat because you still have 2 numbers left over i still have 3 numbers left in my quotient but what else tells me is the indicator for why i need to repeat
because 4 goes into 12 more who feels comfortable going through the problem who remembers the steps in their head as they re doing it go we know we re going to divide so 4 into 12 equals how much 3 next we ll do 3 times 4
equals 1212 -12 equals 0 what am i doing next issue does 4 go into one here what am i going to do
one is the remainder is one our remainder no remainder this is the perfect opportunity to review back yesterday quotient so why would we not have a remainder at this point
we still have a 4 to bring down we still have a 4 to bring down
00 times 4 is 01 -0 equals one and now we bring down our next friend 14 14 yes how many times 3369 12
did counting by 3 s what should we be counting by 4s make sure for those of you who have issues you put your multiples on the side equals 12 all right we have a remainder of 2
review so again when dealing with a partial quotient algorithm division we should feel about it as an easy step by step way to help us with long division algorithm what s an easy way to remember the word algorithm if you were to see it on a test or in your homework think remember the long division family from yesterday and the day before and this morning
we had dad mom sister brother and rover and all of these guys have a part in the process something dad divides mom multiplies sister subtracts brother brings down rover repeat or remainder i said i m going to keep repeating this until you have it burnt into your brain process but something changes today
process let s see student j who goes somewhere down he is no longer part of this process because you can kind of see how we work it in so we re going to start by setting up the problem like this it looks just like the traditional long division method except fro the long line that s drawn to the right
this is what helps us to keep us focused while we re working through this problem using partial quotients so what s that thing that we need to have up there okay so just said 3 times 13 times 13 times 100 about he s very correct but what is he talking about
what s one thing that we learned about yesterday we might want to keep to the side to help us stay focused on our problem numbers in this case he s already identified them
d so we would know that so you can know what it is like okay
answer okay but how does this work within us solving the problem finding the quotient so you can know how many times you can go into that number how many times the divisor can go into that number problem everybody should be writing 3 times 13 times 13 times 100
there keep it on the side so we can know how to go through this problem without any issues what is a good benchmark to start this problem with with what s a good number to start with 100 why do you think wants to start off with 100
100 okay so we know that there are at least 103s that can go into 485 okay so he asked himself remember that talk not that you re crazy but you want to be able to talk to yourself purposefully talk you want to be able to work the answers out and reason with yourself
so and yes there are at least 10 more like 100 that we could put in there 100 what part 0 the process of long division is this kind of like what part of the process is this kind of like
hold on think about the process the process doesn t change except for one person what part was this kind of like that we just did there we re talking about the long division process
if we had to find a connection to a long division process in what we just did and asking ourselves how many 3s are in 485 what part of the long division process would that be think the how many 3s are in 485
division that would be like dad divide because you re asking yourself how many times does 3 go into 485 we figured about 100 times according to s answer now we re about to do something here c you add 300 to 485 so is saying multiply 100 times 3 and of course is correct and we get 300
all right now we need to subtract 485 -300 see 185 okay
if we do our simple subtraction we re left with 185
finished why are we not finished we re not finished because we don t have a number up top okay we re not done because we don t have a number up top
finished because in this case 3 in this case it s going to be 3 because i forgot to update my numbers here but yes we know 3 can go into 185 but how many 3s do you think we have in this case
30 but we can take it further and we re taking it further by how by we know we have at least 20 and if you take a look at it what would 20 give us if we had 23s what would 23s give us 6060 could i have gone even further than that
put you could have put 50 50 remember compatible numbers and we were looking at the 1st 2 numbers to give a good estimate
process if you look at the 1st 2 numbers for what s left here we have 18 20 we could have used 50 or we could have used 60 further but in this case let s just finish it up
so we have 3 times 20 and that s going to get us to 60 which one do you want to use 20 or 60 or 50 way so we have 60 and 60 times 3 gives us 180
and 185 -180 equals 5 be exactly
problem 5 times all right so we have 5 times 15 times 15 times 100 start about how many 5s can we say are in 843
100 who wants to use something else okay what would you use why not start with 100
next we have a partial quotient here
sir 5 times 5 times 8 you said 5 times 8 we have the partial quotient here of 100 estimate so help him out please 5 times 100
h 500 it says subtract so let s subtract go ahead so you re saying 3 -34 -0 is 48 -5 equals 3 all right
now we have to start it all over again and we re asking ourselves how many 5s are in 300 and we know how many is in there 80 about 80 be 4040 and you attach that 0 high but at least you re thinking high
8020 if we do 20 times 5 what are we going to get say 60 why 60
because 6 times 5 is 30 and put the 0 there and it s 300 300 if we did 343 -300 we get 43
good next we start over again again 43 about 8 about 8 why very good because 5 times 8 is 40
good what s 43 -40 going to get me s what should you be asking yourself take a look at our new divisor and our dividend at the bottom else okay so what s next
add the 100 +60 +8 who s done that it s place value pretty easy
got 168 very good our answer yes is 168 remainder 3 nice nice we have a few problems here
we have 123 divided by 5 584 divided by 3 974 divided by 6 678 divided by 10 and that s on the ticket so let s work with b and c it you can work with the person in front of you or who wants to work on their own
who wants to work with the person in front of them so work with whoever you want to work with or you can work by yourself and i ll come around we re only going to take about 3 minutes because then we re going into the 2nd part
i ll get one volunteer to do 584 divided by 3 and another volunteer to do 974 divided by 6
yeah take some time to do it
course i think s trying to indicate to me he s finished
it so has 584 divided by 3 he started with 100 in his partial quotient because 100 times 3 he goes 300 284 then he saw how many 3s go into 284 he went straight to 90
90 because 9 times 3 equals 27 and you put the 0 he says 9 times 3 equals 27 and he just added his 0 back good he has 90 and that creates 270 and 284 -270 equals 14
there 4 times 3 equals 12 14 -2 equals 2 he recognizes that the divisor is now larger than his number and therefore it must be our remainder so 194 remainder 2 good this problem here let s take a look at it
6 he recognized that there are about 106s in that number and once he multiplies it by that number and subtracts he has 374 then he comes back to the table and says how many 6s are in 374 and he recognizes at least 50 56 times 5 equals 30
okay so he got 300 and then he had 374 -300 equals 74 quick question in the next step chose to use 10 and 10 times 6 equals 60 and 74 -60 got him his 14
but based on 50 and 10 what could he have used based on 50 and 10 what could you have used step you did 50 in one step and 10 in one step
step help him out 60 and you would have gotten 360 and you would have been down here already
process you start recognizing all these things you could have saved yourself from when you go through it and of course he s still correct 162 remainder 2 i saw somebody doing a bunch of 10s yes there s another way
what s another way he could have done 584 divided by 3150 times 3 is very good wow that s you took it even further
do since you want to talk about taking things further she pointed out that instead of 100 she started with 150 she got 450 here and was able to subtract fine this about how many 3s do we have in 58 you re going to have to do some multiples but about how many 3s do you think we have
19 what do you get with 19 times 3 i mean you re right i know why you said that because 20 times 3 equals 60 and obviously this number is less than 60 so you scale back from that and then it s 57 so we could have used how much
instead of 19 190 and you would have gotten 570 and you come all the way down to 14 right there in that 1st step then 3 goes into 144 times if you re starting to recognize it then you can use that
safe to give you a safe place to start you now before we wrap this up i ll let you attack but let s move on to the next part
yes that s what i mean because you re using these estimates really but when you re pulling together the answer towards the end and you see how it ends sometimes you might tend to use the ones you get before at the end of your quotient
number all right so we re going to go into the 2nd part which is identifying how do we divide by a multiple of 10 simple if you can remember a few things like divided by 10 go back one place value divided by 100 go back 2 place values divide by 1000 go back 3 place values this might not really matter to you it you know how to estimate a quotient with a 2 digit divisor
today you ll learn how to divide a 2 digit multiple of 10 now one of 2 ways we were working on it when we were trying to estimate the answer what are the 2 things we used things which one did we do with estimate and answer used we used compatible numbers and what s the other thing we used
so we used compatible numbers to do one numbers what s another way we tried to estimate the poem who remembers the poem
with so you do remember the poem fine so we can kind of use that today or we can use compatible numbers but you can see how we put it together 10 what is always true about multiples of 10
rules of divisibility let s see what do you think always has a 0 on it yes not only does it always have a 0 in the ones place any time you do multiples of 10 that right there is part of the trick because we move forward we have flag football team
no well teacher l and i are going to have some fun hopefully in the springtime or maybe even before that but we re looking to start a flag football team so everybody can participate this team has $160 to buy uniforms and the uniforms cost about $20 each
it we have $160 here in our bank we want to buy uniforms and we know the place we re getting our uniforms from costs about $20 for a uniform
get what do you think 8 about 8 why do you say 8 okay all right you chose to take in this case you recognized 20 is going to be that divisor and you just added 20 160 okay what else could she have done
she could have multiplied 20 times 8 so you were doing division through multiplication what else a 160 divided by 20
way she could have done that numbers i would have just said okay 16 divided by 2 equals 8 and added my 0 so ultimately everybody s correct
really each one costs about $8 but what if we had $168 what if we had $168 how many uniforms could we have bought it i have something called a real touchy question
answer what operation in math do you think we can do if you have $168 and each one costs $20 what operation in math division clearly face so obviously we need to use some mental math
it when we use mental math to figure out $168 divided by 20 yeah we recognize that we need about 8 uniforms can we use mental math to divide $168 by 20
sure ask yourself that question no most people may not be able to grasp it so quickly answer what would be a good estimate for 168 and let s say we use compatible numbers
180 so you re asking yourself 18 divided by 2 if you do that it s going to be 7 no 9 uniforms there would be 9 uniforms but how much money do we actually have $168 we have $168 is that a good estimate though we d be able to buy 9 uniforms with $168
to a 160 why do you say 160 because 60 times 2 is i mean 2 16 divided by 2 is 8 and 8 is a good estimate
a 160 is a good estimate i think it works right we re trying to get 8 uniforms all together because we ve got $20 per uniform but is this going to be more or less than the exact answer if we start off with $168 less very good why is it less
because you took away $8 because we rounded down did you rounded down to $160 and you took away 8 of our dollars so you stole from us my friend said could the team buy 9 uniforms
think you have a hard time explaining that yourself you re having a hard time explaining that yourself is there any reason why she may have a hard time explaining that part we re trying to see can we buy 9 uniforms with $168 with this estimate
no why not 9 times 2 equals 18 and ad a 0 and it s 180 and you only have $168 $180 so we need a little bit more money a little bit more money
so all together obviously if you this new team i don t know who s going to be on the team in this class but this new team if we have $168 that we raised through some kind of funding or somehow maybe a bake sale maybe clean every teacher s classroom for a dollar i don t know see that s a lot of classrooms to clean over a lot of weeks
but obviously we can only get about 8 uniforms and hopefully we can get a lot more people on the team than that so here s what i want you to do because we are going to move into a little bit of group activity
i want you to use compatible numbers to estimate this problem 2594 divided by 6 go compatible numbers to solve this one we re using compatible numbers
what s one of the 1st rules of compatible numbers or should we keep it to ourselves and not help anybody friend what s the step that people should work with what s the 1st step in finding compatible numbers
okay we could do that but what a very easy step a very easy step easy step numbers the 21st numbers the 21st numbers
numbers the 21st numbers are 25
is this an easy problem to do in your head 26 divided by 6 no yeah that looks a lot better
class we ll see who takes on estimate and there s another estimate out there what s one compatible number that you could have used for this problem what s one compatible number we ll see who chose what yeah it could be 24000
one that s 2400 and you said 24000 2400 all right 2400s 3000 all right who used 2400 hands 10 who used 3000
8 who didn t use an estimate fine those people who used 2400 stand up for a 2nd you you ve logged your answers and you can t change it now
side who used 3000 again
3000 so 2400 divided by 6 and 3000 divided by 6 okay fine fine fine fine fine fine we want to solve it for you guys over here
get 400 for you guys over here that used 3000 divided by 6 what are you going to get
500 so now let s see what the actual answer is going to be
what if the question was we have $2594 to split among 6 people what if the question was $2594 was available to split among 6 people and you wanted to find the answer to that question
with let s see which estimate is closer to how much money somebody s going to get or how much they should get 25 yes how many times 44 times 62425 -421 bring down my 9
1933 times 61819 -8
money what do you think 400 what do you think 400 how can we round to see which number this is closer to or which is the better estimate round to the nearest 100 okay
4 the guy next door is a 3 more we go down to 40400 would be a good estimate no you d want to get your money $432 absolutely all right
happen i have you all broken into 2 groups within each group we re going to split that in half and probably steal some other people from there see today since teacher w is absent i figure it would be a great opportunity for some jeopardy to review what we ve been doing so far in multiplication and division
so starting with going back so get into one line
after the 8th person we start over with one start to count no even better we ll do after every 3 every 3rd person we start over
all right all the ones at table one area
2nd all the 3s over here
okay let us go ahead and go over this real quick review that you did in your math journal 10 gallons is equivalent to how many quarts 40 40 okay 12 cups is equivalent to how many fluid ounces
96 everybody number 3 128 ounces equals cups what else is 128 ounces equivalent to gallon one gallon okay 2 quarts equals how many cups 8 8 is that what we got one that would be correct
all right for this one it was greater than less than 2 quarts is greater than less than or equal to 32 fluid ounces greater than okay that is correct all right now you might look at this and think why on earth did we do this really really easy math okay it is a review right
8000 remember we use our powers of 10 way back at the beginning of the year and so that is all we are just shifting the decimal over which with a whole number it would be just 8 anyway 9000 divided by 1000 everyone 9000 1123 so what does it equal
this is what you should have gotten
okay if that was 3500 or 3500 what would number 9 be
get 1250 and 0 hundredths okay what is another way to say 1250 and 0 hundredths with the place values 1250 1004 okay we have been using the customary system of measurement for many days
system now we all know from school years past that there is another system of measurement system there is a reason why we did this math right here i already told you that the metric system is like a base 10 system kind of like everything is in units of ones 10s 100s 1000s like that easier you do not have to worry about there are 16 of this and that or there are 40 of this and that
you are working with 10s 100s 1000s so it should be easier up in your math book we are going to look at the metric capacity page and i am going to put it up here on the screen with my little magic but in just the 2nd
here my life person can turn off the front light for me real quick
right we are familiar with meters centimeters millimeters and kilograms grams those are all metric words and you probably had a cup of cocoa or sprite from a 2 liter bottle before unfamiliar and converting from liters to meters is actually really easy and backwards
this a single drop of water is about one milliliter it is a very small amount
i am actually going to put another page appear that has not written in a chart that will be easier to copy but keep in mind that is going to be something that you are going to be required to know yes madam yes that is exactly what we did okay a small swimming pool might hold one kiloliter so that is the biggest unit of measurement for capacity in the metro system
gallon we wish there was something bigger but we are glad we do not have to fill up a pool with one gallon containers a kiloliter would be bigger than a gallon okay so we know that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter i will write that on the board bigger because it is kind of getting squished together with all this other information
1000 milliliters equals one liter so in your 2 liter bottle of coke that you are drinking out of how many milliliters would that be everybody somebody said it
yes okay those so that is how you need to write it
all right we are going to do some of the examples on the bottom together and we are just doing a real quick introduction to metrics and then we are going to do some stations where we will review our standard system we are kind of doing a little preview of the metrics preview and practice here we know that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter
so for 7000 milliliters how many liters would that be divide we are going from small to big we are dividing a 7000 milliliters would be how many liters what do you think
1000 you are working with the 1000s on these b 8.5 l equals how many milliliters well we have not talked about what to do with the .5 500 so let us use that information and figure out what b would be
8.5 l would be how many milliliters we are going from big to small so we are multiplying what 1000 this is why we learned powers of 10 up if your head is down you are going to get sleepy especially since it is early in the morning student what did you get
8500 8500 that is exactly right with your neighbor since some of us need to pep up a little bit talk about c and d neighbor if you are one of the outliers of the group you need to scoot over with your group you are supposed to go to and discuss answer who are you discussing it with
discuss it with yes you can all 3 discuss it
me good okay about another 30 seconds and then i will bet those me s will be everybody in here
information all right letter c 5000 liters hold it up with your hand and show me how many kiloliters that would be you should be ready to give me a half 5 because you should have 5 fingers up
good for d you can not do this with your hand 6.3 kiloliters would be 500 exactly so 6.3 kiloliters or 6 and 3 tenths let me say it with a proper math terminology would be how many liters someone who has not answered one yet boy i am a boy the boys are being quiet today
6 and 3 tenths kiloliters would be how many liters right is this not easier than the customary system
you i am going to put up the reteach page even though we are not reteaching we are teaching it but i am going to use the reteach page because it breaks down and makes it easier simple so you need to have your formula card ready and or your math journal
page 21.4 all righty here is a chart that is going to be really wonderful for you up okay you need to copy down the information i have on this chart
i would abbreviate we do not really use metric cups as often and notice i turned around all of our containers so that you can see the amount of milliliters in them except for this one
liters it is hard to imagine would fit like a 2 l bottle of coke would fit in here but it would down that is as big as i can make it notice they have metric units of capacity and mass
science what does mg stand for for grams grams what does kg stand for
all you are doing is multiplying or dividing using these reference tools right here
so our focus is going to be more on the milliliters and the liters and the kiloliters but you can copy down the other information just to have it
good all right
if you did not get a copy i will print out a copy of this for you to look at to copy from later so let us look at number one metric cups we said there are how many metric cups in a milliliter hold up with your fingers and show me
how many metric cups in a milliliter 4 yeah this is the only time you are going to have to work with something other than a 10 or 100 so 750 milliliters blank cups are to how many cups
it 250 milliliters equals one metric cup so we are going to divide by 250
so this will be one so we are going to divide 750 by 250 and figure out how many metric cups that would be get 750 divided by 250
if i do not see you writing anything down you will get a behavior check because you are not participating when you are supposed to be participating
it we are going to just focus on number 2 and number 4 after this one because these are the ones that we are mainly responsible for knowing 3 yes 3 you should have gotten 3 when you divided
okay go back and check yourself 750 all right for number 2 8.5 l equals how many milliliters well we are going from big to small so we are going to multiply or divide
multiply multiply multiply when you go from big to small that was something i suggested we write down the other day so we remember
8.5 l equals how many milliliters well we know one leader equals how many milliliters what did we just do with the page the regular page in the math book
okay so we are going to multiply by 1000 to change the liters to milliliters 8.5 milliliters equals or 8 and 5 tenths liters equal how many milliliters what do you think this one right here
multiply by 1000 to change liters to milliliters multiply this by 1000 1000 this is just like these 2
your decimal is going to slide over how many places to the right yes you realize if you are hunched over and you have your head down i am going to call on you because i am making sure you are with us
answer what did you get 8.5 times move your decimal over 123 so if i take 8.5 and move the decimal 123 and fill in the homes what do i get
8.5 well this will become yes 8500 good okay if you did not like i said this is the 1st day we are talking about metrics today take a couple of days and it will click
right okay 3 kiloliters equals how many liters well we are going from big to small again so we have to what multiply again so one kiloliter equals 1000 l multiply by 1000 to change kiloliters to liters and we get 3 kiloliters equals how many liters what do you think
3000 am i making it too hard yes you are making it too hard because it really is easy okay that was just a little bit of a warm up to introduce the metric system the practice page i have that one of the groups is going to be doing when we break up into rotations in just a minute is with metrics
yet what you are going to do is look at these measurements and see if they are correct and if they are correct you are going to color it in
it if you are collaring i would make sure i go through and mark it with pencil 1st and then go back in color because it is supposed to make a path that is kind of like a maze and if it does not make the path then you did something wrong so i would not color 1st all right so i am going to put that with group 3 to start with
whispering do not start yet i am going to go ahead and explain the other station i am going to have group one over here with me going over the homework from last night group 2 and everyone is going to be doing this i have some capacity matching cards okay i have been stapled so the 2 pages do not get mixed up
all right there is one spot that is really dark those matchup with the light colored fonts them this is kind of like doing the word sort you are going to glue it on construction paper pieces i would lay them all out and match them up 1st before you glue
if you do not you may have some mixed up because there are a couple that could be more than one answer like if i had one cup it would match with 8 fluid ounces and some of these are not just the easy ones like 3 gallons would be how many ounces so you are going to have to use your math journal use your formula card use your math book user gallant man over there
and your brain and your brain definitely to figure out the answer to these all right we are actually going to since we have such a large group i am going to push this table back and we will probably just sit on the floor to be easier so that everybody has enough room because it is kind of hard with people standing up
okay so i am going to have group one up here and liked person turn the light on please i am about to would you go hit the off button on the projector box for me i am going to have group to doing this station here student you might need 2 pieces of construction paper
and you can kind of work together as long as you are whispering let me see this 2010 the page no i know that
but what book did it come from does it say february march 2011 yeah this is kind of off topic but do you think leg during readers or writers workshop or something that i could preview yes you can still preview it and then you can still bring money tomorrow
okay i do not know if the camera can see me if i sit on the floor all right i am looking for the quietest group to give tickets to because the drawing is tomorrow and there are not a lot of tickets in that basket all right let me pull this board over here and case we need to go over one
now this one was not just capacity it was a review of other types of measurement length and weight all right i was going to say you might need a clipboard in case you did not get one right or something to bear down on
okay i would go get something like a clipboard or a folder to put your paper on real quick
clipboards we checked them all on the bottom okay good do not tell them yet we are going to talk about bonus the answers to the bonus questions too
good okay i am going to give you some questions to do on the back so i have asked you to get a clipboard twice that means you are not following directions so either get the clipboard quickly or have a behavior check what is the we are going to talk about it in just a minute
time while we are waiting how many milliliters in a liter 1000 1000 how many liters in the kiloliter 1000 1000 there are lots of 1000s for your answer in the metric system
remember okay this is another page you are going to keep as a reference page to help you so in addition to your math book you have a kind of note pages to use to study for the next time we have a test we are going to have a capacity quiz next week and it will have metrics and standard system
all right so 3 gallons is how many quarts 12 yes if you got yours wrong you need to let me know so we go and go over it paper i am afraid if i sit on the floor the camera will not be able to see me that is why i am sitting up here all right for the next one for w 4 lbs 6 oz
70 because how many ounces are in a pound 16 16 is different ounces than fluid ounces 6 6 yards 16 g 18 feet is 6 yards because there are how many feet in the yard
12 wait no exactly okay and when you think about a foot this is a foot right here your little standard size ruler 30 how many centimeters are in a foot yeah about 30
up so it would be a little bit more than 3 of these to be a meter stick 16 yep i am glad we have pickups to measure with and we do not have to do tablespoons every time we make kool aid and have a cup of sugar 3 feet 11 inches is how many inches
47 okay what did you multiply 3 by to figure out your inches 12 yes 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot that is right here
yards 7040 yards is in 4 miles yes because there are how many yards in one mile 1760 yes what i timesed it you all multiplied for letter b 1760 is that which you did
good for 64 fluid ounces into cops we are going from small to big 8 cups 8 yes because there are 8 fluid ounces in one cup yes okay £4000 there are £2000 in a ton 2 what did you get what is something that would be measured in tons
paper why do not you have it then so is it at home right this is what teacher has been talking about
folder if you always have your homework in your homework folder unless you are writing on it you will be able to find it ticket i am thinking about group 2
3 okay you do need some space to lay these out so if you do need to sit on the floor somewhere that is fine because there are a lot of cards and i mix them up purposely i would start by laying out all of the same ones with the same font together 1st all right so the next one 5 gallons is how many pints 40
40 because there are look at gallon man 8 pints in every gallon all right we are on i 16 16 exactly all right
it i am tired it is hard 1st thing in the morning but trust me this is much better than doing math in the afternoon tough £6 is how many ounces 96 16 okay how many pints is 7 cups 14 yes 2 cups in a pint this is 2 cups multiplied by 2
2560 good 12 quarts is how many gallons 3 because there are 4 quarts in a gallon like there are 4 quarters in a dollar okay
32 okay good the puzzle says white but right it is not funny but begonias are a type of flower and they are just making a joke because they say what do bees like vast they were spelling it like be gonias it is not funny but it is the answer to the riddle yeah okay for the bonus i did not require you to do it but let us look at the answer
it okay for each conversion conversion means a change tell whether you should multiply or divide okay if you went from yards to feet you are going from big to small can we do 2 things and one might say for instance multiply and add in one like when i multiplied i did 16 times 4 +6 equals yes yes for those you have to multiply and add
but it is talking about just any time you are going from yards to feet what are you doing you are dividing you are dividing no you are multiplying you are multiplying because you have to multiply 3 times 4 to get your answer because there is 4 quarts we are talking about a what is a in the bonus box your answer is right it is multiply as well but you need to explain why
because you are going from big to small we are going from big to small exactly think sometimes small to big that is dividing at pints to gallons so pints to gallons you divide because there are more pints in a gallon okay here are some questions for the back over we just started metrics but i want to do a little bit of practice
right i am going to actually write them on here real quick 4 l equals how many milliliters 25 kiloliters think about the number 1000
today and you can just write 1234 on the back answer that is not helpful okay
so odd numbers but that one is easy 1234 they should all be easy you while you guys are answering these 4 i am going to walk around and make sure my other friends are on task
me good morning good morning buenas dias all right are you guys doing okay with this even though we just started metrics
it i feel like this is much easier than the customary system because you are multiplying by 1000 you are working by 1000s if you finish you can work on page 419 in your math book unless if you have unfinished work from math you can work on that but if you finish that is like the partner page to the one we just did together
journal we are going to switch stations in just a minute i know that group 2 has not finished at all so you will finish that one before you get the independent page i am having trouble with number 35
these are we all finished with all of them yeah okay we can talk through them because like i said this is new it i got the same one i can not tell it is not bald it is a different font like the print looks different
like i used broadway font for one and then that is the jester font 4000 okay what about number 2 35 kiloliters how many liters 3500 3500 you did 35 times 1000
35000 let us look at that one 3 move your decimal over 3 places to the right here what why should there be just to use the power of 10
35000 yes so you would slide it over we 123 35000 not 3500 3.5 or just take your number and put 3 zeros on the end of it it the reason is because we are using the power of 10
okay i need to see everyone working not meditating over their scissors you i only have to multiply it out okay 2000 milliliters is how many liters 2
one and then for number 4 you are multiplying because you are going from big to small 10 all right any questions about these 4 problems
yes madam which one number 3 number 3 okay you have 2000 milliliters for every liter that is 1000 milliliters so you are just dividing it by 1000 you think it should be harder and then you are confused because you think it should be hard but it is not
to all right we are not going to have homework on metrics tonight because we just started it today and because i want people preparing for worldly wise tests and the tion spelling test but like i said we will have a quiz next week on capacity so you can take a few minutes every night and be practicing there are tons of good websites to practice on i have already given you several
okay you guys are going to go back to your group metrics you said yeah you said you said independent but you can talk together
sheet good yeah i am going to pull let us see no i know group 2 is still working on this so when you guys are group 2 everyone look at me for just a minute when you are finished with this center you are going to go ahead and get this one
i think actually i am going to go ahead and give i do not want you all to have all these mixed up pieces so i am going to let you guys you guys need a long time to do this one because it takes a while so i am going to let you guys start on this 11st but when they are finished they are going to come here and get this
here and we have a small group so i am going to go ahead and let you start on this center you come sit over here them so you sit well you just stay over here
okay that is why because i am not sure exactly how the cameras are angled so i do not want to put you up here all right would you guys rather sit at the table or on the floor floor well if you want to have a chair and sit right here you can bring your chair
works we could just make a small group this is a small group
plenty we are going to do something on the back when we are finished going over the homework if you did not do the bonus box go ahead and look at the bonus right now and think about what your answer would be the bonus box on the flowerpot is it supposed to have an a or a b
no we have to write whether we would multiply or divide to get the answer it is not multiple choice i did the bonus box teacher yeah there you go not you know even if you figure out the clue on one of those things you still have to have all the answers that match
page i will revoke the privilege of people working together on the independent page if we are not staying on task
together all right so this homework was to review length and weight as well as capacity because it 5th grade we just focus on capacity but length and weight are lifelong skills that you need to know
forget all right so let us look at f 3 gallons is how many quarts 12 yes if you have a question about one or someone gets a different answer we will explain it going okay i will wait just a minute
from i have a suspicion that i know okay also if you are working together that does not mean that one person does the work and everyone else copies together working together is everyone is contributing if someone is just trying to copy maybe it is because they do not understand it and we can look into that
okay for w what did we get yes 6 because there are how many feet in a yard 3 because there are 3 feet in the yard one cup is how many tablespoons 16 yes inches because there are how many inches in a foot
12 think about your ruler when you think about a foot but the last one just counted as one foot and then -one inch you could do it like that way or you could just have done 36 +11 yards did you mean 7040
okay good because you should have multiplied by 1760 8 yes you should have divided by 8 because there are 8 fluid ounces in the cup right £4000 is how many tons 2
tons elephants cars elephants or cars that is exactly what i was thinking trucks teacher letter n 5 gallons is how many pints pints pints pints i speaking of i letter i
16 all right £6 is how many ounces 14 if you just use your chart it is pretty easy i use my chart all the time yeah that is fine
there i am looking to make sure that people are working together not talking together that okay what letter are we on 10560 good gallons 3 gallons because there are how many quarts to a gallon 4 yep
2 yep because there are look at gallon man 16 cups in a gallon good and you are funny funny answer to the riddle why but gagne is of course because there is a flower called begonia and they were just making a joke
funny all right so for the bonus we are going from yards 2 feet which is big to small people did not get that there was a flower called begonia they would have gotten it well like i said you probably do not spend a lot of time in the floral shop unless there are begonias on the side of the soccer field and then unite say that
right so we are going from what color are they they can come in different colors feet we are going from big to small so we are going to multiply from pints to gallons we are going from small to big
job okay on the back of your paper 0 gosh sorry it good okay i would like group 2 to have a really good start on that almost finished at 10 20 am
good i would at least get one side glued down like all the same font
tomorrow i do not know if you guys heard me when i told the other group we are not going to have homework tonight in math because you have 2 tests to study for week we are not doing it until next week
it is wooden yes that was quick easy it is not i think we should have done the metric system 1st because it is easier but i started with our system because that is what we are familiar with
exactly if you can just remember that there are 1000 milliliters in a leader and there are 1000 l in a kilometer you re good that is okay that is why we preview things and that is why we review things yes
we have review and preview everything comes to me slowly right i am fast that math because everything is well so far you are doing pretty good today you did well on your homework all right for number one what did we get
be what about number 2 35000 3500 they got that one wrong far number 3 2 l 22000 they are much bigger yeah it you multiply
job i would not start on that next station i would just if you were working on page 419 this was 123 and 4 on page 419 you can work on that page like number 5 through 15 on page 419 math okay i would look into that 1st
always when i say here is something extra you can do go back and see if you have unfinished work yes madam you know that paper we were going over yesterday the we were going over are we going to go over that yes yeah yeah we just need to move on to metrics yeah hang onto that paper the one we did for the independent practice the other day that we were going over
it paper that you just gave us when we came over to you what do you mean does that count can i do that yeah if you are not finished with that definitely this metric page we are turning in page this is going to be turned in as well so this is to math grades we do not always do stations for a grade but today we are
best i am not going to pull the other group because we only have 5 min tomorrow i guess if you did not do it you have an extra day teacher said i do not mind us using those fancy pencils from the book fair but if they become a distraction they are going to be evicted from the classroom
yes madam done yet should we go and glue what we have down did you already glued down one all in the same font yeah we have done all that yeah i would maybe we can put these can we write it on the back yeah that is a good idea them like give them a number like one and then match one with one
that if you are doing the matching cards if you are not close to being finished i would write down the matches on the back because you do not want to have to start all over tomorrow
everyone in group 2 hear me about what i told group one and group 3 about the math homework tonight okay
right baseball pants on the floor i am finished good did you correct the ones that were wrong yeah make sure on this metric page the moving day you correct the ones that are wrong that is part of it
good and then capacity matching
after they are corrected absolutely
those and if they are wet with glue you can lay them up here until the end of the day so that you could put them in your work folder
me all right are you sure about this one
that is why teacher said double check all of them before you glue extras you and these extras i will leave them appear on the table until tomorrow are we yep 4 no it did not evaporate
over so you guys will have to look on with the other group i am in group number 3 i was just wondering 0 group 4 will have to look on with group 3 for the science experiment accident it got knocked over you would not believe how sticky that water is already because some of it has evaporated
but i think it is going to take until probably next week for it all to evaporate no wonder it was so sticky can i use a sharpie yes there is a red one and a brown one well never mind okay sink okay there are some right there on the counter
science that reminds me to get lemon juice out of the refrigerator because i do not know how old that one is all right pick someone to walk with you if you are feeling lightheaded okay and make a good choice
cleaning pennies let me see if i have the right do not you need vinegar juice for that yeah like i said i might not have we will have to back that up and do it tomorrow i know i keep saying back it up but because we had to do that counseling thing yesterday we are going to do the things that i was going to do yesterday today and the things from today tomorrow
yes you do not need your science but you just need a pencil
boys and girls we re going to start our lesson this morning i know that you know some things about subtraction
right yes now can you tell me what you know by this by this words what do you know about this word actually what do you know about the word subtraction do you know what s the meaning of the word subtraction like 2 what s the meaning here what s this what is subtraction for you
like to me like if you have a the rule is like if you have a big number and you want to can you hear him you want to divide it with someone and that s what you want to divide division i mean no
away yeah taking away yes that s a way of looking at it yep what do you what do you mean by by subtraction subtraction is when you like when you have a big number and you take away the small number from it
what for example you have 3 -23 -2 subtraction do you have any no anything to say about subtraction what is subtraction for you
it it s when you when you subtract a bigger number a larger number by the smallest number you subtract a larger by a smaller or what you mean is you you subtract a small number right from a
subtraction when you re giving away things when you re giving away what is that again like if i gave if i have 4 cookies and i gave you 2 that s like okay if you have 4 cookies and you give 2 to your friend then you re left with
yes you you gave 2 of your full cookies to your friend and you re left with 2 yes like subtraction and and addition is like they are what are they cousins yes
they are cousins yes i know what you mean by that you re trying to say that that addition is the inverse and subtraction is the inverse of addition yes because 2 +2 equals yes exactly
now today we re going to to start talking about strategies to solve subtraction problems right now i will ask you what do you know about strategies what is what is strategy what is a strategy a way to solve a way to solve a problem
good an approach a way to solve a problem and you have your own way to solve a subtraction maybe you have your own way to solve a subtraction maybe you have your own way
we re going to come up with these ways or these strategies to solve subtraction but i would say before we continue i would say that subtraction is when you have 2 numbers and you re trying to find what
them you might say how far for example is it from 5 to 10 right how far yes 5 yes how far is it to 15 how far is it from 10 to 20
75 now you re trying to find the distance right the distance or the difference between those 2 numbers 50 or how much we say how much more is for example 10 than 5 or how much less is 5 than 10
idea yeah now what you do is you subtract and you know that sign the sign that we use sign subtraction a subtraction sign right minus now we re going to be working on some problems today and the following days and you ll learn this more
what i m going to do now is i m going to write a problem here i would like you to work on this problem to come up with what s your own strategy to solve this problem right i want you to work with your partner now
what are you going to do over there hey what you re going to do is you re going to try to solve it independently right then you share to see what strategy you used
here this is the problem 892 -567 all right that s what i want you to do is to solve this problem
now before you solve it i m going to i m going to ask you this question said i said what is the distance between these 2 numbers right
what is the how far is it from this number 567 to 892 or how much more is 892 than 567 or how much less is 567 than 892 yes can we show more than one strategy no just one
one just do one strategy problem once you re done okay you may share with your partner when he or she is done okay then you share your strategies and we re going to share as a class
this maybe you re you re ahead yes what do you do over there tell me what s your strategy
do i did 2 -7 the 2 is too small than 7 so i borrowed one equals 12 so 7 to 12 is 5 and then i got 8 -6 is 2 and 8 -5 is 3 so 325 how would you call your strategy you have a name for your strategy i don t know you don t know will you come up with a name for your strategy
thing yeah and same result do you have a name for that strategy you didn t think about that name i don t remember you don t is that the only way you could solve that problem you could what could you try it to do it using another strategy
now what strategy you guys are using to solve it it okay then just tell me what are you doing what was that say it louder
892 -567 is 0 what strategy you use there that one
okay if it s smaller you have to put the bigger one at not the smaller one right which one did you use he used the number line and i used this 0 wow
it a number line algorithm yes you did use the u s yeah you said that you use what a number line you know that number line the number line is a tool to help you solve your problem
it s not a strategy it s a tool you know can you come up with the name for your strategy that you use there
i did it right he got it wrong yeah what you do over here is that one yeah that s what strategy did you use since i cannot do 2 -7 i took away one from the 9 it became 8 then the 2 became a 12
12 -7 is 58 -6 is 2 and 8 -5 is 3 what s the name of that strategy do you know no you don t know yeah okay here yes i m done we re done okay what strategy did you use my strategy is i know that 2 can t take away 7 so i came to 9 i borrowed one from 9 and you get 12
then i put 12 -7 equals 5 then i did 8 -6 then i did it equals 2 then i did 8 -5 and what strategy is that i don t know you don t know the name of your strategy
you how s it going here use we did what strategy is that how you call it you don t know then you put the 9 yeah
yes what did you do here what number line is a tool that you use to solve yeah this this is good use this tool number line is a tool you use to solve your problem this no
it now boys and girls let s get together and see what you have here now i found out that some of you used used some of the strategies that we re going to be talking about today but you couldn t tell me the name of those strategies
it s very important for us to identify right identify describe identify and describe our strategy so we may be able to compare them and use and use them to help us solve our problem have what s the what s the answer to this problem
325 everybody got 300 what 325325 but we are not as much interested in the answer as we are in knowing the strategy that you used okay 325 over here what was your strategy
we did 892 -567 do we did you can t take 7 from 2 let me see this 0 yeah i see
right 892 -567 yes and then this what do we have here what do you do 567 that way on the top i took away 2 and made it 12
see this is what right and the 2 became what 1212 now what s the number here 22 all right then i minused 8 and you subtracted 5 from 8 right
is 33 now how many use this strategy else okay all right u s we re going to be talking about this strategy okay how we get there
but any other a different strategy no it s a tool a number line is not a strategy but it is a tool that you use to help you solve the problem but i m sure that you use a strategy there to solve that problem
could you help us with your strategy there this maybe i ll have you come over here and try to to to do yours over here okay it s all right
quick show us how you solved your problem and try to explain your strategy okay don t forget that number line is not is not what a strategy number line is a tool to help you with your problem
can you explain okay you have 8 you have the number line to 892 -300 then you have 592 -25 567 that if you take 300 -800 you get 500 then you re left with 92
so then i put 592 here then if you minus when 2 92 -67 you get 25 so that and after i got those 2 i got 9292 -67 you have 25
now you mean that going from you have a mix of you have subtraction then you have addition right it seems to me that you have a mix of of strategies there which is fine right as long as you re able to explain you get the right answer and you re able to explain your problem right
i did mine addition do you have any questions with that okay hold on a sec question what happened over here yes addition okay you want to show yours here okay come up here
okay you have a name for yours right you don t have it seems to me that you have a mix of of of strategies there because you added you subtracted then you added right
we ll try to find the name for yours and yes okay can you explain what you did there 0 do 567 +3 equals 570
over here 570 +30 equals 60600 +200 is 800
800 +92 equals 892
add the numbers on top do you did addition he said he did addition agree yes yes he did but he did it wrong
he did it wrong where he said no he said he added how is it wrong he added he what did you add top yeah you see that you see that i added the number on the bottom by the top then i just now what did you do
right you you did addition to solve this problem no addition number line what was that addition number line addition number line call it the number line and the 0 adding a number
that now did anyone else come up with another a different one it i did when i did it i got the answer what did you do i did 80 892 -567 i got 325 so i rechecked it
567 you did pretty much the same as equals as he did right 892 you used the same strategy yeah j now let s let s talk about i need to push this aside okay for awhile that s good let s look at all the strategies right
let me ask you this question oops sorry for all this noise did any one of you use this strategy here that i have on that chart did you that okay that s subtracting in parts
parts subtraction by parts you break it up number 892 -892 minus what 567567 now if i m going to subtract this in parts what am i going to do
this 0 i know you took 800 -500 then you that s good 500 then 90 minus then i do what 6090 -60 then 2 -7 now you have a negative number there
6080 -60 yeah okay now let me let me let me try to to to help you here now this is 800 -500 is what 300 it s 33300 now what am i going to do
step what was that 90 -60 60 it equals 300 300 no 30 i mean what about 92 -67 okay what s 92 -67
number 2525 is that 25 yeah is it 25 yep then what s the answer 325 okay 325 is the answer now you could do it the way that you suggested but you would end up with a negative number here and it would be a little bit more difficult for you to solve it
you you would be able to solve it eventually but this is this is a way that you could do it by subtracting the parts of that number now you started with what 800
500 -500 is 300 60 do we have can you come up with another way to do it here 325 what if you start with 892 see 892 minus same number
have 392392 yeah now what are you going to do with that number 67 from it okay now it s going to be 392 minus what that okay 90 minus yes
25325325 over here 325 and that would be the answer right now there are 2 ways to do it when you re subtracting in parts parts now this remember we called it we have a name for this strategy right
then subtracting by parts now could you could you would you be able to identify this strategy if you see if you saw it somewhere for example to the way you start see it s how you start solving the problem
that brings you to the point of identifying that that strategy and being able to describe it parts let s see if you can come up with another one another strategy all right
up okay did anyone use the adding up number this is this is the strategy that you used right by adding up now what did you add
problem 892892 -567 do what s the 1st number that you added 533 to what okay can you check your numbers there
what 3 plus you start with you started with what number 3567 yeah okay okay you started with 567 plus what +3 and equals no what are the other numbers that you have there +30 3030 equals 200 yeah 30
plus what 20200 +92 right and when you add all of these numbers what do you get to get 892 you get to 892 right
now if you maybe if you isolate this okay and you get to these numbers you get to 892 which is 8092 over there that one and what do you do with these numbers them add them up okay you add them up and then you have the answer there
answer 325325 because you added this and add these numbers to get the answer answer now you used a tool that is very important to solve this problem line now this is the number line that you used right to solve it
number 567 okay you started over there 567 did you jumped over here have 57570 then what do you do
30 another 30 over here then see you jumped over here then you have 600 next 200 then to let s say 200 over here what do you have 800 then what do you do have 892 no
here i want you to pay attention i want you to pay attention here please what what did he add what number did he add he add up to 5673 all right +3 what about this one over here 30 what about here 200 +200
92 and when you add these add up these numbers 330 292 you have the answer up you add up to to subtract
now you could make let s say longer jumps than or greater jumps than you the ones that you did over here you could go to let s say 80 or 100 over here so as long as you get to the answer no now so far we we learned what
by parts by subtracting parts right next subtracting i mean multiplying parts multiply subtracting up back okay subtracting back how are we going to do that did any one of you use this use this strategy
yeah but you you confused yours do what s the number again 892892 -567 567 now this is what you re going to do you re going to subtract back backwards now what are you going to use 1st on the list
that number line use a number line right let s use the number line over here now we re going to start with this number 567 over here this is 892 right 892 yeah but we re going from it s back
right we re going from here to there all right back back now let s go from here to there and see help you could go yes you could go to back 92
right then we have what would you have over here 80800 okay 800 here now -2 hold on just a 2nd what 9292 right okay then -40200 yeah all right 200 to be let s say 600
200 and then 30 okay -30 yeah -30 would be what 57570 yeah yeah 570
then then -3 okay then -3 i m sorry so this is 0 that s okay -3 would be that right then this minus what over here 30 use your numbers well you can use a different number right to subtract back
you re going from from the the larger number to the smaller number right subtract we have 3 92 200 30 and 3 to get to your by the way do you have the answer here
now minus them you what you do them okay you got to add them because it took remember you subtract it you subtract it from 892 567 you re going to add them in order for you to get the answer
then my question is how far is it from from 567 look how far is it from 567 to 892 far 325 it s 325 right now how much listen to my question
how much more is 892 than 567325 right how much less is 567 than 892325 okay now how do you call this strategy here subtracting back okay subtracting back
was subtracting in parts okay subtracting in coming subtracting forward adding back adding back okay changing numbers this is to change and compensate
okay changing and compensating when you change you got to compensate guys 892892567567 okay 567 892 -567
this what is it called what is the strategy called here changing the numbers changing the number what is your suggestion like change what is that you could like change the number that you we could change the number change 892 you have a suggestion
no you want to change you re going to change it right yes to what number 800 to 8000 wait wait will it go down or up
890 yeah see you go to a number that is more friendly all right like a landmark number right that s what helps you solve now if you have 892 and the landmark number would be what
267890 okay let s start with 890 would you prefer to keep that number as it is
-565 -565 565 what is that it s supposed to be 567 67 you want to say 70 i m sorry what is that what is the number that you have here then
565 no it s not 565890 -565 it s supposed to be 565565 is that the real number that you had no what s the number that you had 567 now i said let s not change both sides
easier now what do we have answer 323323 how do you know okay 32323 and you have the answer then
it okay then you have 323 what are you going to do subtract here because we have what s the word i used we are compensating compensating
compensating the number that we subtracted from this when we went from 892 to 892 now we got to add it here to compensate answer 325325 now you could do it by changing both numbers yes you could are you paying attention over here yeah thank you
okay how you call this this strategy here changing the numbers changing changing the numbers the numbers 0 the numbers could be yeah you could change both sides if you re going to change both sides if you change one side you change any compensating to that side
if you change both sides using the same number you going to you don t need to compensate because you re going to have the same answer right because the same numbers that you re going to add will cancel that compensation today we ll do it probably tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
but this is for you just to have in mind sort of the some of the strategies we use sometimes but you don t now their names but you could come up with names for them number we didn t change the numbers we changed a number
numbers what do you think we re going to have how do you know that yeah then you have an idea about that yes i think you will subtract by the places subtract some of the places
okay what do you know about what do you mean by places places like the places of 100s and 10s and ones good okay place value right value 100s 10s and ones
now did we use this strategy here here here to solve this problem yes that s that s the same as what u s algorithm it s the same right
u s algorithm is a way of subtracting by place let s see now what s the number again me 892 -567 okay one at a time 890 92 minus
567 minus what can you tell me yes -567567567 now if you re going to use this strategy to solve this subtraction problem how you do it
you do what now let s try to do it here 800 let me see over here 892 -567 like that yeah okay now remember what someone came here and did on the projector right
did it was or someone was well anyways what do we do over here 12 okay now you cross this number too 12 okay you ve got you pay attention here please you got where do you come up with 10
what are you going to do with 9 then is that 8 yeah 8 over here but is this 9 is this 99 this is 90 right then you took what from took 10 from from 90 and you have 12
it 53253 no 233 now that s the answer 325 do see i m going to do it in another way over here but the same strategy this 800 okay you have 800 right now what number is this
9090 what number is this 22 and over here what do we have 3 okay 300 sorry over here 50500 all right +60
60 +7 +7 okay now is there a way that you could combine what did we do over here that it s not done here me 90 over here what happened take away what happened here
10 you borrowed 10 and you regrouped right the numbers right you borrowed 10 from 10s place from 90 and you added it to the ones place here 12 90 800 now let s do it that way and it s going to be what
800 plus what plus what plus what now 8 plus what 8 is that 880 +80 +12 what see how i used the parenthesis to remind me that this is subtraction right
what 60677 now is that subtraction over here okay now what are you going to do right what is 12 -7 equals 55 what are we here 20 and over here 3300 what do you do with these numbers
and 5 and that you have the answer all right these yes these are the strategies yes
when you were subtracting in parts how did you get how what 0 when subtracting in parts how did you get did you go back to it it okay what do you call this 11st
parts in subtracting in parts how did you get 92 i got 92 on the 92 minus over here 892 -500 is 392 7092 from over here
is that 92 over here -67 over here right remember we took 500 from 800 right over here and then down here we took 890 or 500 from 892 this now i m going to give you some more to do
you could work with your partner or we ll do it individually then share with your partner it s questions one and 2 i want you to use 2 strategies choose those that you learn today maybe to solve question number one
10 you didn t sorry so question number one used 2 different strategies let me see i m going to give you 5 minutes to do it good yeah okay just question number one all right just number one yes question number 12 ways
okay you could use your tool if you can use adding up subtracting back or any
one okay use that but use one that you you you never used before okay are you using a different one different use one that you haven t done before okay
need all right are you doing yours yes what is that if that is the answer
no that s not 5 yeah but you got to over here it s got to be over here okay use one strategy over here and another strategy over here okay use one strategy over here and another strategy over here 2 strategies
which one
one back subtracting parts this is a way of practicing practicing these the application of these strategies
you re going to be working on these problems tomorrow the day after tomorrow and if we have time maybe next week too to practice more yes what is that
no we re not doing the other one yes here the subtracting in parts subtracting in parts it okay but what is the other one you re planning on doing the the last one what s the last one
adding no adding up me i want to see people using the adding up and subtracting adding up subtracting back right algorithm if you could use another one rather than yes then u s
algorithm that would be great fine what is that what is that which one how do you call that sub subtracting by place
yeah because see what number is that this is what number is this what number is this what is this this is 1000 this is what i did it but i m not that s right that s why you got to borrow
remember this is borrowing and regrouping yes what is that i did 275 you have different answers then
check so what is that you re going from 275 to this one 1569 okay what are you doing are you working on it question are you subtracting
yeah what strategy are you using what strategy is that subtracting in parts is that subtracting in parts do 1567
okay then yes all right what strategy you use here how you call it subtracting in place by place place i m trying changing changing one of the number one of the numbers
boys and girls a we are going to get in to a new unit it who remembers the tale of the unit we will be working with
them identify the what do what should you be able to do with numbers before you start working with them know how to say it 4947 what did she just say 4947 how else could you say it
4947 how else could you say it said i wanted to know how else you could say it
4000 you are right but how many 100s are we talking about 49 yeah 4927 right that works right
so when we talked about 100s you say 4900s when you talk about 1000s how many 1000s are in this number 10 10000s 4 it is 4000s 4900s 4000s okay what if i do this
what do i get then you now you are talking with your hand over your mouth so i really do not hear you see
12947 how did you do it i know that 4000 +8000 equals 12000 so why did not you choose any of these numbers someone else
one so said this is 12497 problem which is good but my question is how did he know not to touch this that stayed the same my hundredths place my 10s and my ones stayed the same
t because there is no numbers at the end zeros are not numbers no you do know
j the zeros are really nothing because nothing so if i just took those zeros away that number is the same something be careful of how you phrase it r 8000 has no 100s 10s or ones
one what are you trying to say what there are digits yeah the value is 0 here right in that place value is spot right it does not mean there is no hundredths how many hundredths are in this number 0 how many hundredths are in this number no
10s 800 right how many ones 8000 so they are still there right but the digit that represents the place value is 0 therefore if you add a 0 to these place values is it going to change no the 1000s will be manipulated
it same number 4000 and let us subtract 800 mentally
4147 raise your hand if you agree with 4147 you must be on to something so why
because i do not know one did the same rules apply did you have any of those did you agree with this
you do you agree with that it because you just took 800 away from the number so the hundredths place is here right because the digits are 0
same you have got to subtract 800 from how many 100s 900 can not for example what if i have to do this same number but i do this minus this number 52
what you can not do that can not do it can if i have $4927 and i spent 52 could i do it yes i could do it but why is this problem not as friendly as maybe this problem or this problem
j because with those 2 other problems you have the same last 2 digits you are saying because i am keeping the change in the last 2 digits it makes it harder or more challenging ahead sorry because the 50
terms you are right but use terms for place value i want you to use go look at your desk and see what i am talking about when i talk about place value what is bigger no want some help who wants to give him some help
what he is trying to say is that the 10s in the 947 is smaller than the 10s in 52
mean you have to regroup i do 4 how many total 10s 494 49410s that yeah i could right
now we regroup because we are trying to shorten it and i am trying to explain to you that if you can not explain why regrouping works could you do it no so we are going to work with these large numbers and see why we are regrouping in the 1st place if that is the strategy you choose subtract yes yes okay
so the 1st thing we have got to get out of the way are these large numbers one tell me when you have got it
on if you think you know how to say that number raise your hand 16843 raise your hand if you agree with
right raise your hand if you can tell the answer to that 3000 so i am adding 16843 to 3000 get 19843 is what she said
that all right we can see the same thing applies but the problem is adding these big numbers and finding them okay
in a minute you are going to be with your groups and you are going to be looking at one of these we have all worked with 100s charts before right yes i do not know what this is
chart it is a 1000s i did not say shout it out when you think you know here in a minute you are going to know how many squares are on this so do not think about it right now
should not this is how we are going to count what is important is finding the numbers i want you to find when i write them on the board group this is how you count on this chart attention it starts right here so if i say find the number one the number one is right here
one it goes across down you are going across just like the 100s chart one to whatever number is over here yet i am going to put certain landmark numbers up here if i say find the number 100 raise your hand if you think i want you to count to a 100 just like this one 2 3 4 5 all the way to 100
grader what do you think i want you to do if i say find 100 on this chart count by 10s count by a larger number 2000 think i want you counting 2000 with your partner
t count by 100s count by a larger number count my 100s fill in the landmarks as you get up there so you are more accurate okay you are each going to get one of these erase if you make a mistake you can erase with a wet paper towel okay
there is going to be about 15 numbers i want you to find with your group and i do not want to see anyone start from one and try to count up to that number because that is inefficient us think about what we have been doing when we have been adding 3000 you are going to try to figure out how many rows do i go down going by 1000
100 you do not know yet because you do not have your chart but when you get it you should be looking for those certain things here i need one group at the back round table but i have got the out there
the other groups you just have to clean your desks and spread this out on it in front of you
you are going to go to the rug 1234 rug
actually you guys go on the board you that goes on the floor
that remember there is 2 ways we can do this
hand everyone should have at least 2 markers it you are working together to get this done 100 i want all multiples of 100
get somebody on that all multiples of 101 5050
you you have to circle the numbers i told you to do all the numbers on the board need to be circled
where are they supposed to go
that should not be too difficult
100s multiples of a 100
where is number one
that last box right there
only the 100s good keep going
do you have another marker
work give me one color here i want you to count by 100
left i want counting by 100s right now that let us go
here you can count backwards
i am trying to help you out guys
come on
names on the board none of them it is funny that with no names on the board finished 1st good job so i can show the whole class
that is not magnetic
go sorry i left it upside down then fix it
1760 how many years ago was that
it 13111st group
fine i need everyone sitting with their groups
capped everyone in their seats please
the 1st thing you are supposed to find is all the multiples of 100 it no one counted so how did you do it we went by 10s all the way to 10000 did we went by 100s okay
so you counted by 100 all the way to how many 100s then count 10000s right good j you get a ticket what about my 1000s that was the last thing we had up there which was not really necessary because if you did number one correctly number 8 i believe should not have been a problem
p every 1000s what every 1000s is a what is a 1000 it is a 1000 so if you count 100 10 times you are going to get 1000 10 what is 100 times 100
share every dark line would be like a 1000 so you split it up the way they split it up the darker black represents a 1000 did that tell you which box was a 1000 how do not forget some of us were confused
1000 because the square went above the darker line was a 1000 yes are you sure sure you are saying this one right here like this group has it right above this extra dark line right
that represented 1000 and that is how you guys did it j every box that was represented and 28 each row is 28
paper no like going down this way it every piece right there is 28 really not the whole box just that row the pieces would be 28
no we did 28 times 3 equals 84 then added the 10 to it and got 100 t a 1000 no each row
100 100 in each row so how many of rows are in this 1000s chart chart are you going to take it 10000 did anyone count backwards i did this is addition and subtraction did anyone count backwards to get these numbers
so when i said find 9025 did anyone start at 10000 and work their way backwards does anyone else want to try to explain that even if you did not do it how could you do it for a ticket 9090 they are not listening
no it i want to start at 10000 and get here 9090
now the way we did it was we counted backwards from what it he counted by 100s until he got to the i do not want to count it
backwards i want somebody to count from 10000 back to 9090 ahead for 9090 you take away 10000 take away 10000
no 10000 minus count backwards right here
not you are looking at the answers right here you are going to start at 10000 count backwards by 100 to 9090 board when you guys started you had 10000
we are taking away 100s until we get to 9090 away let us get to this number counting backwards by 100
9999 no 9900 thank you
9800 thank you k what everyone get it
one 9600 9500 9400 9300 9200 9100 9000 you are going to take away what from that 9100
many we want to get to 90 away if you did mental math and just counted backwards 10000 minus what would be 9090
d i have got to get at least one person 910 all right these are going to be the numbers you will work with large numbers
them you are going to be working with them but a lot of this is going to be mental math which means on your homework sheet you guys are going to do that tonight it mentally mentally mental math and sure you should practice this is what i need
way the oldest person in the group collects the markers oldest person the tallest person in the group folds up my charts
i know at least 10 people who are going to get their name off the board i will tell you that put them on the bench
all right listen shh all right get your eq copied down today we got to how we re going to model multiplication of a decimal by another decimal okay catch up your . daily decimal to the 48th day of school
almost halfway to the 100th day yep school it can t be simplified can it be simplified know because it s an even an even number so we know we can divide by 2
481 and 482 and something 4 and 124 and 12 some of you have 4 and 12 and 24 all right 2 and 245 no
100 can we go we know 2 definitely is there anything larger than 2 larger maybe something greater that s also a factor of 4 a factor of a factor of 100 biggest okay now what do i do with that once i got the greatest common factor all right it s up here
what s the deal you got a pencil now you need a pencil have one okay all right can we figure out the pencil thing maybe sometime when we re not teaching a lesson i m saying stuff that you might that s going to help you later on in the lesson
okay so we got our greatest common factor what i do now know now that i know the greatest common factor s for what do i do with that information
c you divide the 2 the numerator and the denominator by 4 all right good i like numerator and the denominator divide the numerator and the denominator by 448 divided by 4 gives me 12100 divided by 425252512 over 25 so if i give if i take the same candy bar the same size 2 candy bars the same size
okay and then give 48 of those pieces he says yeah i got 48 of candy but they re super tiny pieces of candy okay and i say i m going to give you 12 pieces of candy but it s the same size candy bar i m just going to cut it in 25 pieces m so if he takes his 12 and lays them next to s 48 they really have the same amount of candy
okay it s still equivalent and then as a decimal . all right we put our tenths and our hundredths so can i use this 12 when i m writing it as a decimal no no because this is 1220 fifths i don t have any parking places for 20 fifths okay so i have to use i do have 100s parking place so i can put it just like this
48 hundredths okay easy peasy 48th day of school already almost halfway almost halfway to 100 we re pretty much 14th of the way yeah through your 5th grade year yeah 14th okay all right what about this
back way back toward the beginning when we were talking about how in math we can use different ways to solve the same problem word we said we could make area models and we used another word that starts with a remember what the when we re talking about area models we said there was a different way of yeah
arrays you probably did it in 2nd or 3rd grade yeah okay so what would an array for a 6 by 4 look like array all right all right come draw yours on the board
yeah some people some of those there s lots of folks that have made circles in 4 rows of 6 no you don t have to copy it down doing we re making a 6 by 4 array because we got to understand i want you we got to review arrays a little bit before i can show you the how we re going to use those to model the multiplication of a decimal by a decimal
okay let s see what we got 123450 and then 123456
fix okay so does everybody recognize this now see you can scoot over if you can t see okay so here s a 6 by 4 array what if i m . what if i made it this way
a 4 by 6 a 4 by 6 is 4 by 64 by 6 okay same thing except for i just turned it sideways so i ve got 6 going this way and i ve got 4 going this way but either way i have a total of 24 in each one okay
arrays did you hold it in front of the camera yeah i ll be back to get my cord all right i don t know why okay so look today what we re going to do we re going to make arrays except for we re going to it with decimals
these are whole numbers so when we re talking about and think about what happens when we multiply 6 and 4 and you always get something greater when we ve been multiplying right yeah we re always getting something greater when we multiply today we re going to multiply by decimals and the decimals are less than one right if i tell you that you have 110th of a dollar you don t have anything
system when i say you have 110th it means this is your whole number spot 10 tenths you don t have any whole numbers one so i want you to watch what happens today when we multiply 2 factors that are less than one okay
yes the r number okay all right so what we re going to do now is we re going to figure out what a model of 7 tenths times 6 tenths would look like okay we re going to figure out what a model of 7 tenths times 6 tenths would look like
and we got to figure out a word for multiplication okay it take those off again did it and did it array they did this which is perfectly fine
they did 4 groups of 6 okay multiply if you have 4 groups of 6 okay so now if we put of in here look it says what would a model of 7 tenths of 6 tenths look like so we re going to figure out what 7 tenths of 6 tenths would look like
m yeah we can t have a 4 in the whole number s place so look you re only starting out with 7 tenths of a candy bar and you get a fraction of that fraction okay 0 where as really this is a whole lot i mean it s decimals and fractions should be written the same way remember we can really be doing 7 tenths write it as a fraction you get you have 7 tenths of a candy bar so you don t even have a whole candy bar
this okay so you have less than a whole candy bar and then you re gong to get 6 tenths of the 7 tenths that you already have so what do you predict is going to happen to our these are our factors
smaller so see you got to think about it different in your brain now something less than one all of a sudden our products are going to be smaller usually when you multiply your products get larger okay you with me all right stay with me on this this gets kind of it s really changing the way that you have to think about stuff we re adding some new information that s going to make you think about it in a different way so you got to stay with me the whole time
so let me make a model of 7 tenths and 6 tenths okay a 2nd all right don t draw all this i ve got some . i ve got some 10 by 10 grids that i ll show you here i ll give you so you don t have to worry about trying to draw all the 10 by 10s but does everybody see my 7 tenths yeah here s my one whole rectangular or square candy bar okay
have the white is the wrapper behind it that s missing okay and your mom says you get 6 tenths of what s left part look at the screen you re going to miss it all right so i got to show it on the same model
today now i know that some of you can multiply it in your head and figure out where the decimal goes all right but the thing that you have to i want you guys to understand it deeper than that i want you to understand more than just doing the stuff you got to understand why it works okay the cool thing is you can probably show your parents this and they weren t taught it this way okay so watch what happens if i put my 2 models on top of each other okay okay whoa awesome okay
so now then you can see that i hve this is still blank space down here here was my 7 tenths is in purple okay no it s not it s backwards okay gold 6 tenths is in purple okay
so if i have my 7 tenths and i take 6 tenths of it then the part of the candy bar that you get is right here when the color changes where the overlap is okay other pieces all right this you don t get like this part is still there okay
row the next row would be 6 more so 12 right yep 6 more is 182424303642 okay so you get 42 but these are little squares
right so you get 100 so you get you don t have a whole candy bar and you only get 42 hundredths of a candy bar okay 2 he was on the right track because he was thinking 6 times 7 is 42 okay
look it s less than 42 hundredths is less than 7 tenths all right and it s less than 6 tenths you re getting less because you have it you didn t have a whole candy bar to start with and you re only getting a fraction of that fraction okay so it s easier if we think of this multiplication symbol as of because i say i m getting 7 tenths of 6 tenths okay
now the way that i m going to give you a sheet that has 10 by 10s in it and look how these things are shaped all right i took one of my factors so i took my 7 tenths and i shaded it in vertically okay see how . i keep on i m it the wrong way i took one of my factors and i shaded it factors i did my 7 tenths horizontally okay look at this word
horizontal does anyone know what that word is horizon horizon huh when you re looking at the horizon all right you re looking at the because the curve of the earth right you re looking where the earth is curving so you can see you have sky and you have land and it goes this way okay so if we put this on the end of it it goes the same thing
c or horizontally okay so horizontally goes left to right and then the other one pieces i shaded in 1234567 of them yes up so you take one factor and you shade it horizontally
sense i m going to give you paper so you don t need to draw this because i want you to watch okay square i took that square and i sectioned it off into 10 equal pieces okay so i have 12345678910 equal pieces and i m saying i have 7 i don t have a whole candy bar
7 tenths so i shaded in 7 of them and the 7 tenths i have i shaded in gold okay
and out of that 7 tenths you get 6 tenths of this so i take it and i divide it into i take this and i divide it vertically into tenths okay and i get 6 of those so i get 12 . i get 123456 of those
get this is the part that i do get okay all right so i m going to give you some i m going to give you a piece of paper that has some 10 by 10s on it okay paper i have several of them printed on the same paper so we can do lots of models on the same paper okay and that s where you re gong to need your colored pencils so let s do this 1st one together all right so use this side
class we re going to practice modeling them right here as a class and then on the back is we re going to look at how you can take a they give you the picture and you have to come up with a number sentence okay so we got some practice on the back but you re just doing this side with me now okay and then colored pencils everybody s got some colored pencils that you can either have you got yours or you got somebody s you can borrow use colored pencils
don t use markers because it will bleed through and you won t be able to do your homework or your class work okay
pass them around crayons pass them around yeah as long as it doesn t bleed through
see colored pencils do work the best though i think that will work colors colors you choose the colors
gold okay you want to pass them around alone just have 2 colored pencils that you re going to use and quit rattling everything else go 5432 we got our 2 colored pencils
quit rattling them one and 3 fourths one and 3 fourths one and one half one quarter okay shh so what i want you the 1st thing i want you to do is shade on your pick your top your top left square on this side down okay i want you to shade in 3 tenths left to right
so shade in 3 rows horizontally just 3 rows
right anyone need a piece of paper okay
color wait
the top 3 rows now this is multiplication
would it matter if i does it have to be what if somebody decided they were going to shade the 1st factor of 3 tenths no no because the order doesn t matter in multiplication okay so you shade your top 3 you should shade one factor horizontally and the other factor vertically as long as you shade in different directions for your 2 factors it doesn t matter which way you start okay
overlap overlap yep
they re going to overlap because you re doing 3 tenths of 5 tenths what 12345 and then you can see where the colors overlap
product you don t have to color it solid
faster i know we need to label our models so we can say our parts
side this is 3 tenths and down here this way is 5 tenths okay so it s like you have a candy bar you re eating this gold candy bar okay
so you come home and you open up the candy bar and somebody in your house has already eaten all of it but 3 tenths so you have 3 tenths of a candy bar left and you say mom can i have some of the candy bar and she says yes you can have half of what s left so there s half and a half
right so you get half of the 3 tenths b watch this and then you can keep coloring watch this and then you can keep coloring left the white is empty wrapper okay
okay so we just shaded in 5 tenths but we only get the part there was we know this is 5 these this light green down here is empty wrapper sense up here where they overlap is the part you get half of the 3 tenths that was left that s not this part down here is half of the empty wrapper so that s nothing up here this is how much you get okay
so then your dad comes home and says home much of that candy bar did you eat would you say that you ate half much i have a so you get where it overlaps got that s your 15 tenths that s your product okay
so you got we need to write this into a decimal okay squares those are my 100s so you got 123451015 so i count the overlap and this is my this is your product 15 hundredths okay
product so 3 tenths and 5 tenths are your factors 15 hundredths is your product so you got half of 3 tenths and look what s happening
factors look at your model like this and ponder how act like scratch your chin and you know how people when they re trying to figure something out
they kind of squint and look at it sideways when i multiply i usually my whole rest of my life until i met teacher f i multiply and i got larger numbers
factors now all of a sudden what is this this is like 3 tenths that s like i m filling my zeros so i can see it all in 100s this is 3000s times 5000s and i get 1500s i get 1500s so look 15 hundredths is less than both of your factors so i m multiplying and i m getting a smaller products
be look at your model and see if you can see if it makes sense as to how that can be because you can see it in the model c someone ate some of it so that means there s not a whole lot of it there s only like half like there s only 13rd i mean there s a 3rd of it
3rd half of a 3rd so both when both of your numbers when both of your factors are less than one your product gets smaller again let that soak in when your factors are less than one your product gets smaller
accident .1110th of 110th 110th okay on this . on this kind of big part of your paper up here we have some space so turn your paper sideways and let s write down our observation here
go when both factors are less than one . we re just we re not done with that yet
i just want you to write it up here where you got some space okay
so when both factors are less than one the product is less than the factors
what if somebody said i m not going to shade 3 tenths horizontally i mean horizontally i want to shade 3 tenths vertically would that change your answer no no as long as your factor as long as one factor goes horizontally and one factor goes vertically like if i did it the other way it would just look like this okay
either way . either way i still have 15 hundredths shaded in okay okay let s try a different one
yay all right try making a model using one of your other squares grid write down 8 tenths by 2 tenths so now you get home and there s 8 tenths of a candy bar left yeah mom says you can have some but you can only have 2 tenths of the candy bar unless she says you can have unless she says you can have 15th which would you rather have
15th or 2 tenths 15th 2 tenths 2 tenths 2 tenths 15th or 2 tenths 15th all right let s see 2 tenths 15th 2 tenths 2 tenths same thing
same thing that s why you got new math you might go to a store some day and have a cashier that does math in their head faster than you and they can trick you out of some of your money that s mean there s mean people in the world okay 8 tenths so you get 2 tenths of 8 tenths so you re not getting 2 tenths of a candy bar because you only have 8 tenths of a candy bar to start with and out of that 8 tenths you get 2 tenths of it okay
2 tenths now write the numbers inside top okay and you can decide
factors so either choose 8 tenths or 2 tenths and shade one of them in in one color okay yes shade it in that way
direction not one direction infection that would be that s what i ve heard all right yeah but you need to shade all the way
67 so make your 8 tenths go all they way all the way that way okay so do 8 tenths all the way to the end and then come back and do 2 tenths this way
okay all right come on okay now then come back and do your 2 tenths so where s the 8 tenths let s do 8 tenths left to right okay
so that would be that s 12345678 so you re going to shade all this in in that color okay did you all do this in texas
texas my sister yeah but it s not 3 bar this whole big thing is the candy bar and you only have 3 tenths of that candy bar
does that make sense okay shh those of you who are done shading listen up shh all right if you re done shading go through and label your model product teacher f if you think about it it makes sense because it has to equal 16
yeah so the multiplication just point out the multiplication facts aren t really changing listen the multiplication facts aren t really changing but where we put that dot that means a lot is changing okay like on that last problem 5 tenths of 3 tenths well 5 times 3 is 15
and we had a 15 but our decimal we had to put our decimal in the right place okay 6 times 7 was 42 and that was still 42 on our 1st 118 times 2 is 16 so guess what them but the decimal makes a difference okay
bars and there s no way you can have if you start out with 8 tenths of a candy bar less than one candy bar and you get 2 tenths of it there s no way you can end up with 16 whole candy bars so if you write 16 as a whole number you missed it even though there s a one and 6 in the answer but if you got to put those you got to put the one and the 6 in the right parking places you don t have a 10 and you don t have 110 and 61s
you have 110th and 6 hundredths is towing area fine restricted area have we got it shaded and labeled
mine because i had to there s my 2 tenths coloring teacher f you said 0 i have to turn it
it doesn t matter if there s my 8 tenths it doesn t matter if you put the 2 or the 4 right there because look at this 10 i see okay yep
yep it matches this way okay so if you traded . if you traded yours a different if you did 8 tenths horizontally then you just turn your paper a little bit and it looks like the one on the screen
matter so that s still commutative property that you learned in 3rd grade still works even when multiplying decimals okay so 8 tenths times 2 tenths so if i get 8 tenths of 2 tenths
go above your problem right now where you have put the word of in parenthesis over the multiplication sign so when we start thinking of multiplication the word of is usually a clue that we re multiplying
24 here you have 8 tenths of 2 tenths all right if we have 5 classes of 25 in 5th grade you could figure out how many 5th graders we have okay except for all our classes aren t an equal size we re catching up though now that we re getting that s right we need only one more to be equal okay
to the other so what do you think cool yeah never multiplied decimals i have before now if you can still get on mathletics now you can do the multiplying decimals thing perfect okay now we got to do this
it shh okay the other way we got to look at it is this so far i ve given you the number sentence and you ve made the model so now if we really understand it we should be able to look at a model and figure out what the number sentence is okay
backwards let s look at a model and see if we can figure out what the number sentence is okay clue before we go onto it look one of your factors goes horizontally let me put the right factor going horizontally one of your factors goes horizontally okay
vertically and then where they overlap is what part of the number sentence we have factor times a factor gives us what
lap all right so let s look at the model let me show you a model and i want you to see if we can figure out the number sentence all right shaking put your pencils down and let s look at this one together
screen okay so now we need to identify the equation and the area model below okay so that means we need a factor
and we know there s going to be a decimal number because this whole big square represents one times a factor gives us our product okay represent 866 look one subtract like i look and see there s 4 into one so there s got to be 6 that are full because there s only 10
that s what i okay i know that it s going to be 100 so that s . yeah so there s 6 tenths so there s see i got 6 tenths so there s one of my factors and then down here i have 2 tenths 2 tenths and then 6 times 2 is 1212 but look i can t put it s not 12 like this all right it s not one and 2 tenths it s 12 hundredths and that should match my overlap
123456789101112 so my number sentence works it s kind of like 0 because you okay my number sentence works 2 tenths so again we multiply look if we look at it like money you got to stop coloring and look
money 16 hundredths times 20 hundredths and it gives us 12 hundredths 60 and 20 are both greater than 12 okay so it s happening again
we re getting our product has now gotten smaller even though we were multiplying okay so go home tonight and tell your parents that teacher f told you that you can multiply and get a smaller number okay now don t say the decimals part
off say we learned today that you can multiply and get a smaller number and you re parents are going to say what then you re going to say when what there are decimals when the factors are decimals
okay now your mom s going to say whatever teacher f says is right that s what she told me in conference today i said ooh i m going to have to use that okay now look at this one paper write out the number sentence see if you can figure out what number sentence this model represents all right look at the model
there look at the model and see if you can come up with a number sentence write it down on your paper out look at the model you ve got to stop coloring shading you re missing the lesson on the screen because you re making it look perfect and checking coloring
all right figure out what the 2 factors are and then figure out how much of the 2 shaded parts overlap
it that s right write down the number sentence that goes with this model okay did i get it right did you write down the number sentence not yet
i want to see the number sentence 1st so i don t have to this that s one of them factor look at this it s gone all the way to the top and there s only one left
yes ma am you don t understand what part overlap yeah what do you think making a little bit of sense all right look
look if i just shade in this part how much is that way there s 90 out of 100 shaded in okay that s the same as 9 tenths shaded in
factor so one of them is 9 tenths and then this part i look at that just by itself now i have 40 hundredths shaded in which is the same as 4 tenths
one yes i put the 2 together then i have 36 squares that are shaded in all right i have 9 in this row 1827 on the 3rd row row so it s like an array inside of an array okay way i m missing a very important thing all right this little guy
if i say i have 36 that means my decimal s here but it s really not it s 36 hundredths without this that s saying that you have 9 tenths of 4 tenths and you have 36 whole candy bars okay don t i have 3636 hundredths of a candy bar
well moving up your fractions then because remember with our decimals they got to be either tenths hundredths thousandths it s got to be a power of 10 to work with decimals all right now the cool thing is our next unit after we finish up this decimal stuff remember p after we finish this up after we later in the year we re going to do multiplying a fraction times a fraction okay
this can t we write 9 tenths and 4 tenths as a fraction did 9 tenths times 4 tenths look what you can get 369 times 4 what s 10 times 10 no it s not 36 tenths
multiplying it s 36 hundredths that s easy 0 we re basically i think it s challenging but okay take this we re going to continue this on monday i m not going to give you homework over the weekend is that all right all right so listen
it i didn t think it was supposed to work past today but maybe it goes off tomorrow you can do mathletics all weekend because it s mathletics is designed mathletics folks are like positive versions of drug dealers mathletics they make it free for 2 weeks out of the year so that schools get to try it out and kids get to love it and then they say if you want to keep using it then you have to subscribe and it will cost you this much
how much does it cost okay i don t know how much it costs but we have ipass which is similar like the school s not going to pay for mathletics and ipass because they both you know like in mathletics you can i can assign you stuff minutes so take your take this sheet that you colored on
freeze freeze freeze freeze freeze what s he begging for food yeah seriously nothing i do i need to review the tape
no okay so put when i say go not before then i need you to put this sheet that we ve been practice on in the inside pocket of your black binder so we can find it monday rings on the rings not just shoved on the shelf beside your binder away and then so the 1st group that s packed stand behind your desks furniture
we ll be done by 9 45 today ok ok your desks are cleared and we re getting ready to start this morning
s ok yesterday we had discussed that for the next 2 weeks or so we re going to start what new concept in math good try
m exemplars exemplars good and we said exemplars were another word for what
exemplars it s just a fancy mathematical term for
you we re going to do an exemplar together and i m going to break you up with a buddy and you and a buddy will work on the exemplar on your own
problems we ve seen word problems before we know what word problems are what are they problems that you can read and problems that you can solve
e world problems are problems instead of using numbers they use words to describe examples you have to choose the operation you use to solve the problem ok so you have more words and sentences to figure out how to solve ok
now is there one way to solve a mathematical problem no you can go about a different way and when we get in our groups in a few minutes you re going to find that s group and s group they came up with the answers but they both went around a different way to get it yes in math it s ok there s no one path to take to get an answer
we can go a different route and come up with the same answer
front try the front ok put the back one on work ok leave the front on and cut off the back
ok no that s too ok that s fine we can work like that ok the exemplar we re working on this morning is called what
cream and i ll just call on the ones in the front to read it because it s a little blurry for you in the back exemplar pat loves ice cream he went to the store to buy ice cream cones they had strawberry vanilla and chocolate ice cream he could have a sugar cone or a plain cone how many different ways could pat have all of his ice cream ok
so you get an exemplar and you read it then you remember what said it s more sentences and words not so much as numbers you don t have your 7 times 9 it s more story word for exemplar we ve worked with word problems before
what should be the 1st thing you do besides reading it what should be something else you do n or underline the keywords ok let s just hold that for a 2nd say i read it but when i read it not one thing did i comprehend what should i do reread it
it now while was reading it i hope most of you were or all of you were reading it in your mind and if you weren t take a few seconds to comprehend exactly what this exemplar is saying to us now now that we comprehend this exemplar what should we begin to do
underline the keywords before we underline the keywords we have to understand what though we have to understand the question we have to understand the question a can you see it back there
d how many different ways can pat have all of his ice cream cone now in your own words that is exactly what it says here but in your own words can you tell me what the question wants from you what does it want you to do
count how many ways pat can order ice cream how many ways or how many different ways and this is how s strategy would come in she would underline some keywords before she attacks this problem
what are some keywords in this problem that you would underline so you could stay focused and comprehend what they want from you many how many why would you underline how many
you are you guessing or do you actually know no so what does how many do what does it tell you about it tells you about about about amount it tells you amount i m sorry i thought you said about
amount help him out are the words how many a keyword for you to underline not honey you re going to have to speak up i can t even hear you
it you don t know how to explain it alright why aren t the words how many a word you should underline because it s asking us to get the answer it s not telling us the answer in the problem because if it was then it would be a different type of question did you hear her
can you get up and speak to your peers please louder
them how many isn t a keyword because it s not it s asking us to get an answer not telling us the answer because if it was then it would be a different type of question instead of how many different ways could pat have ordered his ice cream cone so again let s focus on the keywords
what are some keywords if you had this exemplar in front of you this is one we re doing together you ll do one on your own in a few minutes a different cones ok in the question it says different ways so i have to focus on different ways
else so different ways
m could have could have what could could have help you with it
m it s not really a keyword ok it s not a keyword but there are some words in this exemplar that would help you when you get exemplars when you get story problems you don t just jump into it and start trying to solve it you have to break it down and try to understand what is it that they want from me what do i need to stay focused on
k the well what are we talking about ones strawberry vanilla and chocolate and what do you think we should do to those 3 flavors why why underline it
i m not sure ok that s an honest answer you re really not sure and this is what exemplars are all about
thinking we re so used to writing down our answer not explaining our thinking or not sharing our thinking that when the type comes to share you re like well i know i m supposed to underline it but i can t explain why and that s ok because this is where we re starting to learn how to explain our thinking ok
what else do we need to focus on in this exemplar the sugar cone and the plain cone excellent good in addition to the flavors you need to focus on we re not putting these in cups we re adding these to a cone but we don t just have one type of cone we have
cones so again like said we have the sugar cone and we have the plain cone ok so i underlined strawberry vanilla and chocolate because i understand those are 3 given flavors those are the givens they re giving me that they re not making me think about different flavors they re saying here s the flavors i want you to work with that s your given the cones are also your given because those are where they re going to put their flavors on
now that i understand and i broke it down i m going to go to my question and how many different ways could pat have ordered this ice cream cone answer i want to take us through the process to the answer wait i know the process no process yet
yes when they asked how many different ways could pat have ordered his ice cream could he are they can they stack all 3 of them on one cone that s where your thinking process will come about in a few seconds cubes i m going to give you 3 different colored cubes you re going to work with your buddy next to you
you re just not going to write right now you re not going to draw all you re going to do you and your buddy are going to learn how to verbalize how to communicate how to use words to talk about your thinking so if i pair up and to work together s not going to stand there and watch do all the work they re going to think about ok let s take a strawberry let s do this let s do that
they re going to come up as i m walking around i m listening for your language skills being used in these word problems it will be 2 person so you both will be taking turns talking and coming up with ideas again i do not want to see one person standing there silently working it out and the other one looking
ok alright now i don t actually have flavors i know you would love for me to have flavors and cones we re just going to have to use our imagination and use cubes cuuuuubes ok i only need 2 let s see i think i have we have an odd number
ok buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy and you 2 buddy ok so get closer to
her buddy who s he going to work with buddy buddy buddy and you 3 buddy come work with s group please flavors we need vanilla what else
ok can one person from each buddy come please guys excuse me take chocolate vanilla and strawberry excuse me you excuse me
do you need one
one have one thank you this could be chocolate this could be vanilla where is the chocolate and strawberry i m not ready yet 12nd 12nd alright so everybody everyone with their buddy have 3 flavor ice cream
you are to turn your body so you and your buddy are going to be working and discussing and talking about how can we come up with the answer
words now for the cones we have a sugar cone and a plain cone can i have a different buddy who didn t come for the flavors come and get your cone one for sugar cone and one for plain cone however you want to make your cone look like
you need 21 for sugar cone and one for yea you make it long not super long like you can use 3 to make it long cone and that s your plain cone
tell your buddy you don t have to look at the colors just use your imagination to make your own colors that s not a cone here this could be your ok
honey plain sugar ok so in front of you you have 2 cones what are they vanilla chocolate i ll repeat my question again
in front of you you have 2 cones what are they
you re just saying i m going to fix this or i m going to put the vanilla here say it out loud so you start learning how to talk about it
you 12nd i just want you to talk right now
so we ve got 10 so 10 we talked about the exemplars really word problems and how to discuss and talk about it there s more than one way to get the mathematical answer when you re trying to work word problems
and then just learn how to communicate and discuss among each other we talked about underlining keywords and really underlining what the question wants from you things like that so right now they re just verbally among each other partners trying to answer that
part ok
you can put vanilla on you can put a chocolate you could put them all on a plain cone or a sugar cone or you could put them on any cone you want
well you have 3 flavors right
plain these are your 3 flavors ok and they have 3 different flavors so they have like 3 cones each so ok so if this is a sugar and there s you re giving all 3 flavors here
yes and then another flavor for like for the 3rd cone like one cone would have got vanilla and then the 2nd ok so you need some more cubes to work that we will i just wanted them to discuss
i m going to stop in a 2nd ok give me 5 ok again i just wanted you just to talk with your buddy to come up with some ideas on how we re going to solve this
paper you re so used to paper and pencil when i gave you a minute just to talk about it where s the pencil where s the paper i need it it s coming but i just want you guys when we re doing these word problems it s good to know how to express or say your thinking out loud and your thinking process to solving the math exemplar
k now get out your loose leaf paper and a pencil zone now
now each shape is going to get a title ok so the 1st one i want you the title s going to be a question
the next box we ll call a draw it
it and the last box we ll call write it
so those are your 4 titles labels in each of the box
ok ok the 1st box says question let s go back to our question what is it they want us to find out words what is it they want us to find out
ok 1st read what the question says what it states
ok so how can you tell me in your own words instead of copying their sentence right here and putting it here can you tell me what is it the question s asking you
do you understand what they want you to do what they want you to find out what the question wants from you ok help please how many different ways could pat order his ice cream yea that s what it says but put it in your own words what do they want from you mean what most of you are doing is just copying the sentence that tells us that you know how to copy ok
copy who can put that in to your own words what does this problem want us to do do put it in your own words do not copy or read it straight from the overhead who can tell us nice and loud see how many different ways we could put the ice cream in the cones very good could you say that nice and loud again so everybody can hear you
to see how many different ways you can put the ice cream in the cone why don t you stand up in your chair and say it nice and loud to see how many different ways you can put the ice cream in the cones fantastic very good e to see how many combinations of ice cream pat could order very nice i like how you use that word combination i m looking for combination wonderful
read but can you put it in do you understand what it wants you to do what it s asking you now i want you where it says question put the question in your own words you can either borrow s s or any others or you have your own if you were listening to your peers they share some great ideas how you can reword that question
so we want to see you reword the question in the box that says question
and what we re doing boys and girls like miss m told you exemplars are kind of like another level of word problem or we call them webs word possible but in order to figure out these higher level word problems we re going to take you through some steps and we re going to do several of these exemplars until it s just in a rhythm and you know how to get through them
but right now we re just taking it step by step we re taking it nice and easy nice and easy the 1st thing like she said give us a question in your own words what are you trying to figure out here again you re not writing a paragraph now you re not writing a story just change that question that s stated exactly like that up there into your own words
words you heard you heard you heard some other students it using their examples not taking their words you can use it
me it says they want to see how many different ways we could combine the ice cream on excellent combine good word there
ok pencil down when you re done that just gives us indication that you re done and we can move on to the next step
i just wanted to see if they wanted one scoop for each cone or if they wanted to mix up ok we can just yes honey i still can t hear you speak up
afraid said that you have one but you said that but when you read it when you were giving yours yours was exactly you were reading it word for word like it was on the exemplar
exemplar i wanted ok did you hear s did you hear s yes ok you can take any one of those we re sharing ideas so you can borrow those ideas do you want to hear s again can you go over there and tell her yours again
do you understand it now ok she didn t she added in the word combination because you re going to be combining it right
so if you like that way of wording it thank you for helping her that s fine ok now the next box they draw it j pat with ice cream you re drawing pat with ice cream
can you elaborate some more i don t understand what do you mean you re drawing pat with ice cream you re going to draw a picture of a little boy holding an ice cream cone and that s going to help me figure out how to solve this problem yep are you sure you said draw pat and some ice cream what do you think
listening so is that correct should we draw a little boy pat holding ice cream
cone so he s thinking about taking a flavor and adding it to a cone draw draw vanilla and chocolate ice cream ok what are you going to do with the flavors in the cone them combine them ok anything else
what to the ice cream to the ice cream cones get a sugar cone put all the ice cream flavors on it again so we re combining the flavors and the sugar the cones together
e the same thing it s kind of like a multiplication table the way you have like combinations of different numbers to make a product very good very interesting excellent very good
so in our draw it box let s go ahead and do exactly what our peers just said to do we re going to draw different combinations different ways that pat could order this ice cream cone
and i ll start you off this way don t think too deep on it
e you re going to use your creative way to draw and label and key so you can understand your different ways or combinations
ok so tell me what you drew over here this is a plain cone and honey i m like so close to you and i can t even hear you
this is a plain cone and this is strawberry ok so you took one flavor and you put it on the plain you took the other flavor ok and then what did you do over here this is the sugar and this is the chocolate and this is the same like that ok alright good job the combinations so now or i m sorry do all the combinations you can think of
in your draw it box you re going to draw how you re going to figure out or solve this by using pictures ok key ok good my pictures are ohhhh i was trying to figure out what that was
and then i made a waffle cone for the plain ok tell me what you did over here please i labeled it i m sorry i m right next to you and i didn t hear a word you said it i m asking you to tell me about your drawing that you did here
how s this drawing going to help you solve it what combinations did you make with the plain cone and the sugar cone put each label on there ok what s this i don t understand it
key if i had the kids walk around and look at everybody s drawing they re not going to understand the letters that you put there so what should you do a little make it the side key a key right ok
i see 2 cones here strawberry on a sugar cone and a vanilla on a plain cone and you re done yes ok what other flavors do you have chocolate where s the chocolate so wait
what i m understand here is that you only could make 2 combinations yes flavor how many flavors where s your 3 flavors
flavors because 3 flavors can t fit into 2 cones right so here is my sugar cone and i come to your ice cream parlor and it s called s home made ice cream and i say excuse me sir can i have a strawberry on a sugar cone go ahead put your strawberry in a sugar cone
so there s my one combination right then my daughter because you know i have a daughter i say she wants chocolate on a sugar cone can you give me a chocolate on a sugar cone so is this a different combination where is it in your drawing
yes ok then my other daughter because i have another one you remember she comes and she wants strawberry on the sugar cone that yes
ok so here s your vanilla there s your chocolate there s your strawberry no because in the story in the exemplar we have a different cone now cone plain cone ok so here s our plain cone parlor and what am i going to do now
what plain cone i mean a plain cone
with so when i come back i want to see some more cones there ok
that cone was working but it s not working anymore ok so what are the 2 cones that i have 2 cones plain and sugar sugar and plain where s your 2 cones your sugar and your plain ok i need this please so this will be your sugar this is your plain
here s my strawberry here s my vanilla here s my chocolate so i m coming in to your store and i say excuse me can i have a sugar cone with strawberry and there you gave me one what a sugar cone with a scoop of
strawberry strawberry ok then my daughter comes in and says excuse me sir can i have a sugar cone with chocolate chocolate then i have a chocolate cone ok let s stop for now because of our time
i m going to take ok it s not about who s the which one of my classmates worked this i just picked one randomly
here in the draw it box tell me what did
and the number one that looks like number lines miss e is representing that she s showing you that s plain cones
there s 3 sugar cones one has strawberry one has vanilla one has chocolate and then she has a plain cone that has the same thing on it
please she please speak louder
and then here s the other like s saying there s the other cone in case she doesn t like sugar cone there s plain cones and again i have my combinations my flavors on it that is when we were walking around most of you were getting the idea and that s what you drew no ok i ll be there in a 2nd to help you
ok you have the combination ok box in the solve it box we re going to do the we re going to solve it
our operations say it louder operations you need to figure out which operations you re going to use to solve your problem box you re going to solve it she needs paper i know it s right there you re going to turn it into a number sentence you re going to turn it into a number sentence
ok you re going to take your drawing and you re going to take the question that you re trying to solve and you re going to turn it into a number sentence using your operations you ve got to figure out what number and what operations you re going to put into your sentence it s really not that difficult use the same strategies you ve been using to draw it if you ve been able to draw it the way had it that was correct
correct so just think numbers now instead of thinking pictures think numbers numbers look at your picture and use numbers to solve it because yea but you re writing words
right or 2 +one equals 3 sentence again this is words just like these are words turn this picture into a numbers sentence ok in solving it i don t want words erase this please in solving it miss n was standing right here
0 strawberry and strawberry has sugar cone and strawberry has plain and chocolate 22 different kinds of chocolate yea so this 2 is for here this 2 is for here this 2 is for here what about the other combinations
again kevin you re going to get different we re going to come up with different number sentence to solve this might have one way might have another way and they both came up with the same answer but you can find different ways to solve this now look at your picture and turn that picture into numbers
use numbers you know how when we did multiplication we said 3 times 3 equals 9 well i need you to turn this into a number sentence and solve it no no no no sweetie pie sorry i didn t mean to scratch you move down move down
now in solving it again we re going to be using a numbers sentence to solve it you re going to look at your different combinations look at what you drew this is a visual for you to see this is your visual ok
now turn this visual into numbers and give me a number sentence to solve how many different ways i can order ice cream cones i know the answer i just don t know how to put it into a sentence no no i don t want a sentence
want honey 12nd i m working with so again this is your visual change it into numbers and solve it ok alright let s see what my math whiz is doing over here
out because there were 2 cones and then 3 flavors 2 times 33 flavors and 2 cones you re really becoming a math whiz woohoo woohoo i know it is woohoo celebration time at last we are saved ok where is your math i see 2 operations
i see you did a division problem and i see that you did a multiplication problem so is one correct and one incorrect because you can t have 2 different can we share this one with the class sure there s the different ones that we found ok that s fine you see this picture here
you re going to take this picture this is your visual and you re going to change it into a numbers sentence i m just going to use addition ok in the solve it question this is what we want from you a numbers sentence looking at your visual change it into a numbers sentence to solve it
now in your show work again i see you have multiplication and subtraction now what were you confused about so we can start and i can guide you
that there s 2 cones and i got confused because i didn t know what numbers to work with well we want to find out how many different ways we could have ordered the ice cream cone ok so what operation do you think we re going to be using division why do you think division
division because if if i divide the flavors into 2 cones no ok it is not a division problem
number do you have your whole number that you re working with no it s the same in each you have the word each you have the word per so it wouldn t be a division 0 can it be multiplication good now how many cones do we have
e s so said i ve got that plain cone that s one cone and i can put 3 different flavors on it so that s one times 3 but another cone the sugar cone and i can put 3 flavors on it how many flavors and combinations altogether 6 you did one times 3 +one times 3 and you got 6 anyone do it this way did it this way how many plain cones do you have 22 write 2 how many different combinations do i have
4 no back in your story what are the different combinations 3 and you said it was what operation times is it ok if we just cut it or ok ok i said we ve got 2 cones that i can put chocolate on i ve got 2 cones that i can put vanilla on and 2 cones that i can put strawberry on
6 did anyone do something similar to this now look at your picture did you have 6 combinations ok so then here is your sugar cone
alright and then what flavor should be on one of your sugar cones flavor vanilla ok what is the other cone you had go ahead plain that s ok
girls why am i holding this giant red what is it it because we re about to learn about it
because we re about to learn about rectangles we re about to learn more about rectangles yes we re going to learn about the relationship between a rectangle and a parallelogram watch quickly right so there s definitely a relationship between a rectangle and a parallelogram
be what you re doing when you change a rectangle to a parallelogram b they re both quadrilaterals they are both quadrilaterals yes d when you just take the triangle and move it to the other side yeah we re going to do this later
basically a triangle is cut off and it is moved to the other side and that turns it into a parallelogram okay and we re going to practice that later with our paper all right i m going to put this down for now
we re going to talk about and a poly likes to be a parallelogram here we re going to compare rectangles and parallelograms we re going to talk about what they have in common and what they have different who can give me something that they have in common
they both have 4 sides they both have 4 sides okay something else they have in common
vertices and where are the vertices m they re polygons they are polygons who can tell me what a polygon is a closed plane figure a closed plane figure
that all right there s something else they have in common someone just said it earlier common something a little more mathematical
also with the 4 sides what do we notice and who can give me also what do we notice and who can give me another example of another quadrilateral 1st of all what do we notice angles we notice angles in a rectangle what do we know about the angles
too what do we notice about the angles in the rectangle they re all right angles they re all right angles no they are not all right angles in the parallelogram relationship you re going to learn this a little later that opposite angles are equal in a parallelogram so a 2 sets of parallel sides 2 sets of parallel sides
so that would mean okay parallel 2 sets of parallel sides very good yes i asked if anyone else can give me examples of other quadrilaterals a square a square all right and we talked about this before
is a square a rectangle yes yes a square is a rectangle is a rectangle a square no a rectangle is not a square all right now there s another word i m thinking about that also goes along with parallelograms diamond shaped figure rhombus rhombus is this parallelogram a rhombus yes no
h the sides aren t equal the sides are not equal diamond all right now that we ve got the vocabulary out of the way did you have anything else i got something that they both have in common you have more yes they re both symmetrical well the rectangle is symmetrical parallelogram not exactly symmetrical but that was a good one yes something different you would write it down and circle it
right okay so this is symmetrical this shows symmetry this does not show symmetry so what we re going to do we ll do like the ghostbusters all right now we re going to measure area when we go to our desks
we are going to measure the area of the rectangle and the area of the parallelogram but before we do that we need to review the formulas and these will also be circled because these are definitely different who can give me the formula for a rectangle k length times width okay
that is the formula for a parallelogram length times width no formula base times height base times height so that s different i think we re doing a good job comparing they have a lot in common and they have different formulas
when we go back to our seats for our activity you all have everything you have a sheet of paper and you have 2 identical rectangles is and then the 2nd one you are going to turn it from a rectangle into a parallelogram how are you going to do that
you this orange piece of paper here is my model of what a rectangle a rectangle you have to take a triangle out and slide it over corner you have to pick a corner and cut a nice straight line to somewhere on the other side right and i would suggest you use your ruler if you can not cut straight
this then you re going to do what we call a math slide you re going to slide this over and what does it form parallelogram and then you will glue this down like that
all right and then you will find the area of the rectangle and the area of the parallelogram early finishers can also find the perimeter what do we do to find perimeter add up all the sides add up all sides
math when you measure the length and the width you may get a nice the rectangles are random inches but randomly some are placed to the half inch to the quarter inch to the 3 quarter inch so what will you have to do then if you re going to find the area
j you will have to turn it into a decimal turn it into a decimal decimals are there any questions all right we are going to quietly go back to our seats and you are each going to work individually at your tables on your project
i will be walking around to help you please don t forget to write your name on the top of your paper and to label rectangle and parallelogram
the spelling parallelogram especially you need it start by gluing down your 1st rectangle yes
you can also whisper in your group if you need to discuss anything my example here i will example up here also for you to see we ll keep our vocabulary visible as well let me put that there for you
glue and you need to share your glue
parallelogram did you slide it exactly you have that is a trapezoid you have to be very careful not to make your parallelogram a trapezoid if you make a mistake let me know i have extras yes
right but that ll work fine then you re going to glue it who can tell me how we measure units of area
remember square units yes you may need to fool around with it a little adjust a parallelogram and you re just going to slide it
just so it touches raise your hand if you come across a decimal let s see
yet okay you re going to round that to the nearest half an inch be 5 yes
yeah let s go get another one work just go by that length the 1st one
talk talking won t once you start doing the calculations you have scrap paper if you need
you can also do your calculations on the back yeah start right at the line at the one yeah early finishers what did i tell you to do yet you can challenge yourself with perimeter
you can also start measuring some real life articles such as your book your desk your table everyone will be busy yes if you go from there to there it s just about 3
great that won t be more challenging yes hm about the same
why it should be right side by side exactly so your base you don t have to move it now
that 0 that s there 15 is the length of that
hm i would check that again that is not 0 yeah we re going to do it in inches so if you started in centimeters that s okay keep it in centimeters but i would like everyone to use inches for right now
6 yeah 6 is your length you can do your work on scrap paper
well yeah if you know your times tables and you don t have a decimal you will be able to do that pretty quickly yes yes the height and the length let me show you what did
great she went ahead and made her dotted lines like i showed you in class showing the height of the parallelogram right from the bottom to the top
that you can i ll be right with you for the perimeter can we yes
reason that s about what is that 3 and what no we re not doing centimeters we re doing inches that s about 3 and what how many inches is it 31 4 inch
half i see 3 and then i see a little bit more be you have to convert 31 4 to a decimal yes
question okay yes 0 go ahead do you have a question yes one do you measure you have to okay you start right there at the line okay okay it should be about the same notice yes
what is this that one is a little dark okay if you re an early finisher i told you what to do
you re going to yourself find the area and the perimeter of your math book then find the area and the perimeter of your desk you also have the dark part of the rulers don t work very well all right
that s fine but i want you to and start measuring that is closer to 3 than it is to 2.75
any other questions please discuss with your neighbors what you re doing this is only when you re finding you re doing base times height for area
there and also find the perimeter if you d like yes
if you do extra work on the back yes you will get extra credit yes
no your base and your length should be the same same now when you check perimeter why do you think the perimeter is going to be more because you slanted and you made it longer get in the habit of writing a equals label your work
good strategy yes your length is always the height trying to get it exact yes
another object where do i write that on the back are you measuring your robotics paper see how many rectangles you have
rectangles are everywhere are you measuring the box of pencils good job
is going to measure the area of the actual paper you re working with are you noticing where you might have to use a decimal what does that look like to you
you can put it inside or next to it that s fine i d like you to come back to the carpet if you d like to share your paper bring it with you please come to the carpet please come to the carpet thank you
all right would anyone like to share their paper with the class why don t you come up here and stand up and show what you learned and what you did
you had 2 pink rectangles and how did they come out 13 and my parallelogram area was 12 and a quarter of an inch squared and my perimeter is 13 one 2
and for my desk the area was 414 inches squared and the perimeter was 88 inches fantastic job
s do you want to come up and share you had green and how did yours come out
all right let s go ahead and get started so this 9 weeks we ve been talking about fractions
fractions yes ma am we ve turned mixed numbers into improper fractions and improper fractions into mixed numbers we ve done almost everything that you can do with fractions this 9 weeks
so now we are going to do an exemplar with fractions yeah yeah and one of my favorite things to talk about when we talk about fractions is pizza how many people like pizza all right it there s like a 1000 ways that you can prepare it
fractions nobody s thinking about fractions when they re biting into pizza but pizza is using fractions you don t think about fractions until you get down to the last piece and you re trying to figure out who s going to get it 2 well i only had one well let s share it and how do you share that s when you start thinking about fractions when you get down to the last piece of pizza and more than one person wants it so you really don t notice yeah you don t notice until then
and you re still not really thinking about fractions but you re thinking about what s the best way to share that pizza so that it s even and equal because who wants their sister or brother or uncle or cousin to get a bigger piece than they do nobody you know you either want it to be even or you get the bigger piece right yeah okay so we re going to read a book called pizza parts fractions
and on the cover of this book is a very delicious looking piece of pizza especially since i did not get to get the breakfast i want this pizza looks really good book we had pizza bagels today no it was good they were okay it s not what i wanted all right yes this book is actually an ar test
so yes you can take an ar test on this book after we read it
okay so remember this book is about pizza and fractions and while we re reading we re going to have a couple of conversations about what we see going on with fractions in this story and what you re reading in this story is going to help you with your exemplar later okay
party she is happy to celebrate her special day with her friends and family there they tell elena that she can bring her friends to the pizza parlor she can bring them after school on her birthday
friends she is surprised that the restaurant is dark when she 1st opens the door up her whole family shouts happy birthday elena elena s family has decorated the restaurant for her birthday balloons and streamers hang from the ceiling there is giant happy birthday sign hanging over a big table
elena s little brother dante says he helped make the sign elena gives him a big hug so there s a caption here elena s family and friends celebrated her birthday at the pizza parlor so what do we think elena s families pizza parlor is called pieces elena smiles as she invites her friends to sit at the big table
party elena s father said that they may order any kind of pizza that they want menus there are so many kinds of pizza that it s hard to decide eat they decide to order in small groups that way they can all have the kind of pizza that they want does that make sense
yeah because if you don t want pepperoni and somebody else wants pepperoni does it make sense for you to be in their group no want all right sophia and priya want a small pizza that is one half cheese and the other half mushroom how many people have half of something on one side and half of something else on the other side yes that is the only way to keep the peace in the house
because somebody wants olives and you re like ugh nobody else wants olives so you can only get it on part of the pizza makes life a lot easier right one elena s father writes small pizza half cheese plus half mushroom on his notepad he says one over 2 is how we write one half the number below the line tells the total number of equal parts the pizza has been divided into
the number above the line tells how many of the equal parts we re talking about what is the number above the line called t the numerator the numerator and what is the number below the line called denominator so for this pizza the numerator is what
m because only eat half of it no you re close the pizza is divided into 2 pieces the pizza is being divided into 2 equal parts why is the numerator one g
because there s only one pizza like there s only one pizza but how many people agree with g s thinking
a it has 2 pizzas but one has one topping and the other has right very good all right priya says one of the 2 equal parts has mushrooms mushroom parts of fractions have special names 0 look we just went over that sophia the number above the line is called the numerator
priya adds the number below the line is called the denominator
sophia wonders how can we share the pizza so that they each get the same amount this is what we were talking about important would it be fair for sophia to get more pizza than priya in even little kindergartners will know that if i have 2 blocks and if you have 3 blocks that is not fair right
okay so priya replies we can use fractions we can divide the pizza into thirds we will each have 13rd elena s father says one over 3 is how we write the fraction 13rd it means that one part out of 3 parts i m sorry it means one part of 3 equal parts sophia and i will have 2 equal parts of the pizza says priya
the 3 of us will have 3 thirds of the pizza so let s look at what they did they had already decided to put mushrooms on half and cheese on half so do you see can you see the mushrooms on half and the cheese on the other half yes but dylan likes mushrooms and cheese so he gets the bottom 3rd where the mushrooms and cheese comes together
but to make sure that it was equal each person got 13rd 13rd out all right the next group is ready to order eduardo kelly lexi and seth want to share a medium pizza all of them like vegetables
seth asks how can we share our pizza equally lexi says we can divide the pizza into fourths fourths why did they divide the pizza into fourths they re 4 friends they re 4 friends is that the easiest way to divide it up amount this means we divide the pizza into 4 equal parts
one share of the pizza is 14th 4 more children placed their order pizza elana and thuy want olives on their pizza mushrooms melissa and logan want mushrooms but no olives
414th means one part out of 4 equal parts says elena s father we will each have 14th of the vegetable pizza the vegetable pizza got a little bit complicated didn t it
n because elena and thuy want olives on their pizza and melissa and logan want mushrooms but not olives right so how could they fix that how could they fix that let s think about that a little bit
t they could like get like like at the beginning they like got into groups so they could probably like get into groups and have the olives on the pizza and logan could get they can get in their own group and have okay groups okay well let s say the group s already fixed which they already are and elena s dad is taking their order
they re all in the vegetable pizza group which makes sense how can they fix it so that everybody can still get what they want up they have one set with olives and another set with good job they could just do half of the pizza like they did with the mushroom
and so that way one half is equal who can give me an equivalent fraction for one half k 2 fourths 2 fourths and elena and thuy make 2 fourths of the pizza so it would still equal one half if they put the vegetables on
going i hope this is activating your brains into thinking about pizza and fractions and how to divide it up among friends hint hint hint hint makes us hungry too all right melissa asks how can we all get what we want elena says we can order a pizza with half olives and half mushrooms thuy and i can share the half the olive half equally she says
logan and melissa can share the mushroom half equally look that is the solution that you guys just came up with thuy logan says melissa and i will share half of the pizza the pizza will be cut into fourths 2 fourths we will each have 14th of the pizza os that not the exact solution that you just came up with
right melissa says i can see that 2 fourths is the same amount as one half one half of the pizza elena s father says that s right mushrooms you will each have a 4th of the whole pizza we will get the kind of pizza we want says thuy and that s what s important right
half now let s divide the circle into 4 equal parts she says so what did they decide to do they had a smaller pizza and they still had 4 friends to share do
they cut it into eighths they cut it into eighths so if 4 friends are sharing a pizza that is cut into eighths how many pieces is each friend going to get bit there are 4 friends that have a pizza the pizza has been cut into eighths how many pieces is each friend going to get
r 18th okay friends each person gets 18th that s one for that friend happens you have 4 pieces leftover what s one way that you can split it so that there s no pizza left over
s 2 eighths each person can have 2 eighths of the pizza if we do that here s one friend yes yes ma am like if you divide it you can see the fourths in the pizza yep right then she divides the circle again and again
now the circle has been divided into 8 equal parts says we can divide the pizza into eighths or 8 equal parts one piece of the pizza is 18th says hanna napkin 18th means one part of 8 equal parts she says who can give me an equivalent fraction for 2 eighths g just saw it
okay who can give me another one based on this model right here t 14th 14th because remember how you said you could already see the 4th lines in there so if each person is getting 2 eighths of the pizza they re getting 14th of the pizza because those are equivalent fractions right we can cut the pizza into 8 equal slices
there will be 4 slices with green pepper and 4 slices with onion says daniella order he will cut the pizza into eighths evan points to daniella s drawing and he says 2 eighths of the pizza is the same as 14th of the pizza you guys have been ahead of them the whole book right we ve got a 6th grade education party games
now everyone has ordered the pizza they are ready to eat when elena s father and mother bring the food to the table pizza soon everyone is talking again they ate all the delicious pizza and they received the kind of pizza they wanted now it s time for the games and the 16 friends divide into teams of 4
dante says i am 14th of my team he is right team one person is 14th of the team do we agree with that
yes elena s father says that fractions are used to name a part of a whole group such as a slice of pizza fractions can also name part of a group such as one person on a team laugh none of them had ever been a called a fraction before next the friends make new teams to play pretend animals
teams 8 people are on each team one person of a team of 8 equals what what fraction 18th 18th of a whole team animals soon all the guests are laughing with each other
cart elena s father takes the cart to the kitchen goodbye elena has had a great birthday celebration elena thanks each guest for coming to her party the guests thank elena and her family for a wonderful time and then there s a caption down here
it says elena had a wonderful birthday with her family and friends yes ma am like it was about fractions right here yes okay what do you see
i would say she was writing to educate the people all right inform inform and what s another author s purpose that we can see kind of happening while we re reading this story
sir to entertain he s writing to entertain because instead of just telling us about fractions and saying one half is equal to 2 fourths and 18th is one part of a instead of just telling you about fractions he puts the fractional learning inside of the fractional learning inside of a story narrative narrative writing all right what we re going to do now is we are going to look at our exemplar for today
yeah ya hoo all right if i can get teacher s helpers to pass out this sheet who s the substitute all right is not here so if you would pass out
one are we going to be like in groups and needs one all right us who can tell us what we do when we are faced with a word problem
what understand understand what it s asking us to do ma to look for important things right to look for important information that is going to help us solve the word problem right let me give you a little bit of direction before we get started
bit then you re going to break into your math groups maker yes you guys were in teams and you were talking about how to solve your exemplar together way so we re going to go over it a little bit and start having some conversation but the majority of your work and the majority of your thinking is going to be done in your group
i have for you some manipulatives that you can use circles and i have some pizza circles problem i also have the graphic organizer it on that little sheet of paper when you do it individually
poster so i have the posters already made out for you so after we go through it and have a little bit of conversation i will break you up into groups and you guys will start on it around i think teacher c is coming in to help you with your thinking i m not giving out answers but i will let you bounce your ideas off of me and get some help
yes math groups we have 2 groups no groups teacher c and me will be available to help anybody who needs help
groups okay so let s go over it and let s see what important information we get right tim and lisa are having friends over for a pizza party how ironic didn t we just read a story about that wow there will be 5 children which include lisa and tim each child wants 3 slices of pizza
need how will the pizzas be cut into fractional parts so now i m going to go through and read right tim and lisa are having friends over for a pizza party there will be 5 children stop all right
so something that s important that we think we re going to need to solve this problem is to know that there are going to be 55 children which include you can underline or highlight you which will include lisa and tim stop all right so i heard one person say stop right there
stop because it s not just the 5 children it s with lisa and tim okay pizza so what does the word include mean yes there s another person not quite there are people on like the last so how many people do you think are going to be there
children 77 is what you re thinking but let s talk about the word include group so if you re included that means you re a part of the group so what this is saying is that there will be 5 children which include lisa and tim which means lisa and tim are already part of the 5 so there are not going to be 5 there s going to be 3 other kids besides lisa and tim
but all together it makes 5 okay party 55 because lisa and tim are already included in this number right each child wants 3 slices of pizza stop stop
important how many whole pizzas do they need stop yep
how will the pizzas be cut into fractional parts stop so how many questions are you actually answering in your solution 232 why did you say 3 me i said are you sure
3 why did you say 3 because there will be 5 in one but is that a question for you to answer that s okay so you re going to be answering 2 questions in your solution from what we ve underlined and what we ve highlighted you re going to use your graphic organizer can you get that light for me to organize your thinking
so we ve read it through twice and now we go to our graphic organizer to fill out the information and here is an example of the graphic organizers that you guys are going to get so 1st you re going to write out what do i know what do you know highlighted then you re going to write out what you need to find out
a how many whole pieces do they need and how many cut into right out in this square is where you re going to show your math thinking whatever solution you guys discuss 1st and come up with right
explanation do you remember in the back of your math journal where we wrote out words math words that we should use and you were explaining your thinking form transition i want transition words sentences i want a paragraph or 2
right so go ahead and get with your math groups in and send one representative to get your materials wait everybody stop because we re not listening to the directions order 1st get with your math groups and find a spot where you are going to work
materials so if you have materials in your hand you are in violation
after your math group has found out where they re working you re sending one representative to me at the table to get your items here s your graphic organizer
here are your manipulatives use them however you yes can we write in marker or in pencil 1st yes question i would write in pencil 1st and then trace it in marker because you know you might mess up
mistake you might start thinking one thing and then finding out what you re thinking is not quite right and want to change it
pencil all right and join a group group so you can t be in the group with
group all right if you need something hard to bear down on send somebody over to get . anybody else need something hard to bear on
one all right you re going to have to pretend okay because i don t know where it is sorry all right
conversations i should see some people writing down and filling out graphic organizers i cannot wait to see what you come up with
you guys don t feel cramped up right here
you want to like move to this big empty space teacher m can there be pieces like well discuss it with your group it and don t forget you have these orange circles too you can fold them into parts or you can cut them into parts to help you out
them that s up to you
0 sorry all right so you are all writing down what you know before you have your conversations about what you re going to do
we started writing well maybe while he s writing you guys can be having a conversation about what you think you should do
you we re missing a piece what piece i think everybody s missing like a part and i m sorry if you are you re just going to have to pretend that they re here it that s it
it because now we have to put the questions right here because that s what i need to find out i wonder which group is going to come up with some things 1st 1st of all just as a conversation piece how many people think that there s more than one answer
it i heard coming up with something that s sounding like a pretty good plan speak up a little bit so your group members can hear you
huh i m sorry yeah not the i think i got it
to these are just for you to use if you need to model it but remember we talked about what would include means yes so how many children are there total 55 so there s not 7 i got it
work so if you have one way great right bonus work gets bonus prizes i m just saying teacher m we got the answer then get to work me make sure that everybody in your group understands because if i come and ask one person they should be able to tell me what you all are thinking
sir did you need me okay wait yeah how many answers do we have to get for the biggest prize come up with as many as you can other so if one group comes up with 3 and one group comes up with 2 then the group with 3 gets the biggest prize
prize are you participating with your group talking i see you sitting and staring off into space
but why don t you offer your own thoughts
far i have a question when i said that there were 5 each of the how many parts are going to be cut in 2 okay so why don t you draw it out said you can always use the bottom of your pizza sheet sheet because it sounds like you re on to something but i think that you guys might just need to see it
and the other people in your group might just need to see it you know sometimes when people says words it s hard to picture it out they say like each children gets 3 pieces listen to what just said solutions but i think you need to get your team members on board and talk about it
yes what box 0 you want a different type of manipulative yeah just make sure that you keep everything separated
solution we got 2 we got a group that has 21 i love what i m seeing i like that illustration if you need more circles i m going to cut out more circles
hand okay i m going to cut out a few more then we can just leave the tops off because people are going to be coming over
everybody gets 3 pieces of pizza so if you cut tell me again
you re cutting the pizza into sixteenths that would be 15 then many 3 each person gets 3 out of all the so if each person gets 3 pieces then you ll have one slice left over right
fine you can just say that that s the way you chose to divide it up and have one left over solution but make sure you talk about that left over piece right a i need to see you be more active my love
right don t tell me you re going to be too sleepy to stay for girls on the run today 0 so if she doesn t get it help explain it to her
job but think about it
do we need another sheet of paper what type of paper
like the one we had for the math yeah we need to finish our ideas all right here s some more circles there s some more circles over here
we ll take we ll take all that stuff and if you need another sheet to show your math thinking like you have you re running out of room i ll give you another one in just a 2nd
it that means if you re running out of room you ve come up with more than one way correct
paper good job see all right here i know you all were trying to divide the circle into 15
it you could put 5 in one circle and 5 in another circle and 5 in another circle so that s one way to do it but is drawing this one circle into fifteenths is that working out for you no so is that an idea that you want to keep rolling with or do you think you might want to explore some different ways
i want to explore different ways because yeah like we re going to think about getting it into 5s okay so cutting it into fifths yeah and just into 4 so you re going to cut it into fifths and so then how many pizzas would you need how many do we need if we re going to cut it into fifths 3 pizzas 3 so that s one solution right okay so why don t we start there with that one
a why don t you divide this circle up into fifths is doing one and is doing one and then here do they have an example of what a circle cut into fifths looks like this is sixths this part here is 4 and this is that s a half and this is no they don t like because remember the thing about fractions is that all the parts have to be what
equal so has 5 but are these equal parts
can you can get a ruler if that will help they re over here inside the green container back table you re getting a little bit off task why don t you get your exemplar paper 1st
trace the circle and then try to practice making it into fifths on there number yes can i get another paper i don t any more orange there s some blue circles over here and there s some green circles
gone so let s say you re having a hard time drawing it into fifths you don t haven to necessarily draw that out you can write it out when you do your example but what s another way you could illustrate it solution you could have 3 pizzas divided into
solution you could have 5 pizzas and just like cut them into thirds okay k yes because each of the 5 children are going to get 3 slices why don t you illustrate that for me
go here s 3 slices and each kid gets their own pizza then you d have to have how many of them
okay i would say that s probably about as even as i would say did a good job doing fifths so maybe you guys can let her do the other one m i m still waiting for you to tell me why said thirds because read back over the problem and see if that helps you
thirds 0 this isn t equal that s good because the 5 children want 3 slices so if you do it into thirds then everybody s going to get the same amount like thank you
solutions i think you guys just need to kind of delegate who s going to do what here and get yourselves organized okay
i m going to do the 3 like this so far we think that we need 5 whole pizzas and there s 3 slices and then we got 3 more to go
awesome all right tell me one of your solutions 3 pizzas and 5 slices in each pizza all right 3 pizzas and 5 slices in each pizza what else no 5 pizzas i mean 5 people with 3 pizzas no
that s going to be a whole i see what you re saying 5 pizzas with 3 slices in each pizza and then she said 3 pizzas with 5 slices in each pizza and both of those are right yes 4 pizzas with slices 4 slices and okay that s another solution that works and 2 pieces with 2 pieces with how many
and you ll have one left over
okay you all got 4 solutions i m impressed yes pizzas in a how many 80 yeah the pizza s cut in half okay okay then we could put 5 pizzas into thirds and we could put into fifths okay job all right
make sure you add some color to that illustration yeah we re going to you all keep working okay one pizza slices okay i ll take it all right
do teacher m can we have maybe you can help glue or you can decorate the pizza with toppings since now you guys have your solutions
mint you will have better smelling breath and a smarter personality 2500000000 students got smarter and it makes half of your dumbness go away 99% guaranteed to be parent proved and that s before and that s after that s a good ad persuasive never underestimate the power of math i can t wait to see them when they re done
right can i get everybody s attention very quickly all right i m going to give you about 10 more minutes to come to a good stopping place hard i ve heard some great things going on
great what i want you to do is try to come to a place to where tomorrow you can finish up and we can share out on so when you hear it ding this means it s going to be time to start cleaning up okay
i m going to let every group share one thing that they came up with yeah we came up with and then tomorrow we ll talk about all the solutions that each group came up with
yes can we put 6 pizzas and like put our answer in like one
down i still see things on the desk like notices that people are still looking at
what s to the right of you and what s in front of you that notice who does that belong to put it away please what is that it s a recording device here oes it record you whatever you say it s recording right now student i already just guessed can you put your feet in the right way
hat s i don t know all right let s . okay so the 1st thing i think put your daily fix it at the bottom because we ll do that at the very end when she comes to get the camera now the homework
question i forgot one of the homeworks on my desk but wrote them down that was very nice that s fine l student what do you want
you you should have been doing that when i asked for people to have their homework out so far we ve wasted about 5 minutes to therefore you ll be sitting here for 5 minutes doing extra work for me attention you dropped something
i will also check off your homework when we re done 1st i graded them but i still would like to go over them here come up here
here come up here a somebody has no name i don t know whose it is l m the only thing outside of your homework is your daily fix it your homework and this packet everything else goes away including that
this is homework and your homework ou said and your homework you can look at it when i hand it to but then we re going to go over it
pass that to please pass this to please pass this to go why are you talking
b hy do we have to write this down because on the mcast they re going to look for your thinking
1st test question read it missus wayne has a 0 do i the manager of the ball factory that one
the manager of the ball factory made the number of balls so what do we notice about this chart
all right this isn t the best copy of this one but you have it right in front of you right your eyes should be up here
it says monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday it says number of balls made in the 1st week week that 1st number is what student what number is that 10765 the next number is what ext number 1600 . scooch in
600 tuesday 700 . eah that s what i m saying 1704 c or wednesday it says 1698 m thursday the 1st one it says 1542
c friday yep know where it is 1505 column are the numbers increasing or decreasing a oing down okay the 2nd week what s the 1st number
hat day 2nd week monday student 1861 don t have my paper i handed it to you i flipped it over it ve got it sorry sit down
your job today is to not call out and to not get out without being told eatbelt right seatbelt student could you read it student 17 . 1794 or you could have said 1794 if you got stuck on that right next one what does that number say
17000 . no m ast . thursday h 100 . no 0 16000 . 160
correct and the last one now that you have your paper friday s 2nd week student 1610 correct now in that column what s happening are the numbers going up increasing or down decreasing hey re going increasing from 1800 to 1610
n 0 they re going down they re decreasing they going down correct es so the 1st one says the same number of balls were made each day is that true automatically the 2nd one says the least number of balls were made at the end of the 2nd week is that true
week the least number of balls were made at the end of the 2nd week a no because the 1st week is smaller correct the 1st week is what he 1st week is 1505 right so 1505 is actually smaller than 1610
the 3rd one says more balls were made at the end of each week than the beginning of the week is that true no no because we determined that it goes down not up and that says at the end of the week so the only logical answer for that then is yes
d d more balls were made at the beginning of each week than at the end of each week question student so everybody should have gotten that one right there s no excuse for that one slow remember when you re doing these mcast questions you are going to have the whole day to do them
winner like i said my daughter used to take all day and she got advanced in every single category because she took her time
tapping an i tell you my question what is your question hy do you i thought when we were doing this i thought you could go up and . monday through friday monday is 1st in the week right h yeah but . this one s right though if you had that unless you changed it
c did 50 x 4 equals 200 you did 50 x 4 equals 200 so you knew that was not enough right do did 7 x 4 equals 28
you knew you had 28 left over so 4 x 7 is equal to 28 228 did anybody do something different what did you do i did 228 divided by 4 and did you do it the partial quotient way or just the regular long division way
that while she s doing that i m going to get the next one ready not yet not yet
so can you talk us through you went 4 x 20 is 80 so then what do you do
nd then i circled okay because you know that s a partial quotient right put your hand down she s not done nd then i subtracted 228 -80
get student 148s when you say that 8 is divided by 0 you did not have to borrow right
68 take away 40 is 28 so then 4 x 7 is equal to 28 57 so if you take it slow and you write everything out you have a better chance of getting your eyes should be up here
k student yeah that s partial that s fine
job student next one
all right so it says let me see would you read it student wait a minute don t read it because some people are talking about something math 0 away put that away
a student about how many miles is from okay there was no reason anyone should have gotten this one wrong either
a t says that one inch equals 15 miles one inch equals 15 miles answer student 3 x 15 is 45
correct 3 x 15 is 45 because each one is 15 right each one is 15 inches i want to see your work one got it right all right next one
a lot of people got this wrong and understandably so so i m going to show you how to do it wrong know how to do it now
i know how to do it now it student you got it right okay explain it is going to come up and do it because he got it right in the 1st place hat is it
d so just went and did that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one okay and then 6 x 3 is 18
excellent or you know what i gave this b one b 2 b 3 h one h 2 and this was a rose so i called it a rose a daisy and a lily
so if i look at b if i look at just the bear one right if i m looking at just the bear actually because we re just going to do one group and then there s 3 of these so you multiply it 3 times
if i look at the bear and then there s a rose and then there s a heart one that s one way i look at the bear the daisy right still heart one because what s changing is this i look at the bear the lily heart one
now i m still saying with the bear so how many do i have there 33 far i look at the bear i look at the rose but not i change it to heart 2 i look at the bear i change it to daisy still heart 2 i look at the bear what s going to go here
eart 2 no because this stays the same and this stays the same lily so now i have 3 more i have 6 altogether does everybody see that
bear i have 6 for the bear right i have 6 for the bear then if i want to do lamb i m going to have 6 for the lamb or whatever that is and then i m going to have 6 for the elephant so 63 times is what
it student the easy way i m going to show it to you you re calling out all right so how many animals are there ight you see 8 animals here animals how many flowers
hree 3 flowers how many hearts sit down 22 hearts now you could do the same thing yes 2 stop calling out
move your clip for calling out 3 x 3 is 9 x 2 is 18 too there are 3 groups of animals 3 groups of flowers and 2 groups of hearts way if you re not sure you re comfortable with when to multiply then you write the out but what s the most important thing you re doing
what s the most important thing ake your time and don t rush and show . how your work over flip it over the one with the buttons number 16 go ahead read it
go hich of the following shows the wait 1st you have to read the top he table drawer shows the number of buttons that were made at a button factory each week for 3 weeks 84503 80968 week 3 84551
84551 then week one is 84503 80968 there s no reason for anybody to have gotten this one wrong either
slowly slowly got it wrong and i did it slow you did not look at the numbers carefully i did do you see what you got wrong now read it wrong you read it wrong sssh east to greatest okay that s important that s important you have to underline what it says
if it says greatest you underline greatest and least and make a diagram
kishi is buying 2 small balloons and one large balloon what is the total cost of her balloons show your work or explain how you got your answer so
says what s the 1st thing that a says he is buying 2 small balloons and one large balloons 2 small balloons what s the small balloon worth one.25 one.25 and one.25 everybody what is that
$2.50 all right and one large balloon right $2.99 somebody made this $3 which is fine but you have to remember to subtract a penny if you do that so 9 +0 everybody student 9 14 14 carry the one
$5.49 the 1st answer was you should have had on your paper you should have had one.25 plus one.25 plus $2.99 is equal to $5.49 the more exact that you are the more information that you show the more of a better grade you ll get
up did 125 x 2 and got 150 and then i got because you forgot to multiply right right 125 x 2 5 x 2 is 10 2 x 2 plus the one is 5 2 that s why you ve got to be careful
off now it says $6 to pay for the 3 balloons so what kind of number sentence should have ou should have $6 minus $5.49 $6 minus $5.49 what is $6 minus $5.49
1st of all $5.49 is almost $6 right correct so you should have had ¢51 card have one question okay yes
hy is the heart shaped balloon and then the big shaped balloon or the star why i thought the big balloon was one.99
careful all right sam has $10 to buy balloons at the village shop so you know in the 1st part that if you were to double this $5.49 and $5.49 is too much right $5.49 and $5.49 is too much
and it says the clues are he will buy at least one of each balloon he will buy as many balloons as he can so in the 1st part do you want to answer this one student yeah in the 1st part the 1st part part a can help you answer this
c so part a how many balloons did we have e have 2 part a is not 2 balloons how many balloons did we have a how many balloons did we have
we have how many small balloons wo and how many large balloons ne so you have 3 balloons so far right $5.49 and how much money does he have to spend
do well $5.49 ¢25 ¢25 eah and then one it was okay
was going to do $2.99 plus . so you added another 3 and then you added another one.25 so go ahead and do that but you can t use $3 you have to use $2.99
because you already have 2 small balloons and a large balloon now you re adding another large balloon and a small balloon
$9.73 that s pretty close to $10 right yeah how close to $10 is it $10 take away $9.73 is how many cents buy we bought 2 from the 1st part plus a large balloon and then a small balloon and a large balloon
buy ive 5 balloons 3 of them were small and 2 of them were large b ve got a different amount of change left but i did the same thing let me see hree small and 2 large you didn t add right said you could get 5 balloons and you put that wrong but did you have the actual numbers on there
see you did not add right yeah because it was 9.73 right 0 you did $3 you should have done $2.99 right you would have gotten partial credit
eah but i still got balloons you would have gotten partial credit not full credit how did i get it wrong 5 10 18 28 151st of all 15 and 9 is 24 carry a 2 to start
amount let me see go sit down you added wrong too
this so what threw you off was all this stuff and i don t know how you got $9.98 in the 1st place $9.98 and this would be over 10
you subtraction all right yes student why don t you come sit over here just for this thing an i go up on the front table no one i ll wait i ll wait
okay more time that you owe me if you keep talking
that s what you paid that s what you owed so you had ¢51 left any other questions one the next one everybody should have gotten right because we did this one before
everybody should have gotten that 9 15 it then says each class will spend 30 minutes at the book fair and then leave the 2nd class will arrive at the book fair as the 1st leaves leaves what is the total amount of time
if they re each 30 minutes and it s 3 of them how many minutes is that n hour and 30 minutes or 30 times 3 is 90 minutes so you could have either have had 90 minutes or you could have had because that s 30 +30 +30 or 30 x 3 or you could have had one hour and 30 minutes
they re both equal to 90 minutes now b says that s b a was 9 15 c days what time will it be when the 3rd class leaves it it i got that wrong let me see
in put 90 in here 0 because you wrote 3 52 this part was wrong that should have wrong this is wrong if you got this wrong because it s really 9 15 so this one s right but these 2 are wrong so just pay attention so if we are adding 30 minutes to 9 15 what time is
away you could have put it on the board too you got it right id i get it right i did not look at yours yet you could have put it on the board scootch in
day excuse me do we have this conversation every day day let me see did you get this one right got 9 0 i mean 10 15
if you don t do it it s wrong automatically wrong 0 i love the strategy adding . student a strategy teacher no you re calling out again way so 30 minutes . 0 far so far you re at 9 45 right why are you adding 15 minutes to the time
hour yes okay go ahead move your clip you re not paying attention c an i get my sharpener in my bag not at the moment
i ll let you borrow the one that i borrowed from my daughter he borrowed it from her friend she didn t borrow it from her friend it s hers but i have to give it back to her today er friend borrowed it
you don t need a so the answer is the answer is 10 45 is correct
hat s the opposite of what i wanted to do c made a new one what did you do student you cannot do that student yes student okay ou can do it that way
yes this way but that s not long division you can do long division though you did the same thing although you wrote it out an i do it the long division way no
it s easier you can t do long division f you do long division you go like this and put 1075 it s like plain number and you can t do that because you had to have known that it that doesn t answer the question go ahead same thing sit down yours is wrong all right next
9 85 there s no such thing as 9 85 it s the same thing line all right 5 4 3 2
guys when we do these math problems we re going to have to sit girls we re going to have to sit longer bottom same thing goes with you
so the next thing the pencil one can you read the 1st line just the 1st line not even on the right page just got up for a tissue okay go
re they right that one is the 1st one line his one has the pencil how many pencils are there
7 7 pencils so which 2 can you automatically cross off a student one out of 7 and 2 out of 7 me what does it ask you
you student so how many pencils have stars on the wo 2 out of the total 7
no one should have gotten that one wrong 2 out of 7 nobody should have c have another question yet you re also calling out
sit down this one s wrong don t see in there 0 that s wrong you have d d is right i got a b c and d one eah you said 0 c is right i m sorry
c is right you had a a square you know what i m not giving you a grade on this so if you re cheating by changing the answer and saying i have it then you re cheating yourself
student 2 and 5 are 2 out of 7 ou said 2 out of 52 out of 7 are we done eah thank you the next one rosetta will cut the paper shape shown below in a straight line from point x to point y
what 2 shapes will rosetta have after she cuts the paper all right 1st of all what are the dimensions 4 correct
a t s too long in order for it to be the square the length has to be the same as the width and in this case the length is one shorter or 34 if it had said 4 by 4 by 4 up top then it would have been a square but it s not so you automatically take off a and you take off b
now if you would draw a line from x to y what 2 shapes are left rectangle and triangle right a rectangle and a triangle home an i throw it away no take them home y mom i want her to see it though he doesn t even want to
come up here and get this for your group just one page one side an i go on computer right now right now and go sit down come up here and get this for your grow
come up here you re only doing one this time
come on you should have it passed out by now student okay there s another one on my desk has one
one go ahead work on it now quietly can i have my pencils back my marker back sharpener if you re talking you re in . if you re talking you re in an i go to the bathroom no we already did this
go ssssh sssssh sit down
i always spell your last name wrong 0 you know how to spell my last name
teacher 2 my is here no for math right math or . are you hear for reading i m so confused you keep changing the schedule okay thank you for telling me
yourself iss f do you know how to spell my last name you re doing the problems by yourself you re putting your name on it please you can explain it
es work underline all important information on get going is this it
there s no back yeah there s a back but there s not more than . show your work i want everybody to show your work that s the most important thing it how come you have 2 just no no no no no
ssssshh sssssh underline important information
good math students always get rid of the parts that don t make sense student huh his one s 7 8 excuse me
summer marrow read 8 books so she read 8 books based on the how many of our class read fewer her less yes fewer have you done both of them where s your work where s your work did not really do the work because i already knew what it was
work ut i already knew . i want to see it numbered and i want to see your work see student work let me see your work
don t get this you should see you when you re doing that silly fewer fewer than 8 how many books did marlow read student 8
she read 8 books fewer h don t get this how many books did marlow read 8 ight there no where s 8 on the line plot
it ight here right what does fewer mean
me you re not finished you have this other side to do see i love the work that showed s the back right we re going to go over it
okay boys and girls could you take out your math workbooks and take a look at page 45
course page 45
boys and girls we did some problems about another family that took a road trip and now we re going to do some problems where you plan your own road trip minute you need to finish that we had plenty of time for that in the past half an hour
okay has anybody visited any of these places on the map g i visited good you ve been to washington you ve been to los angeles
los angeles see this
this is on the back but let s have it also that s a little tricky hah can i turn out the lights no i don t think that s it bit you can go back and forth
okay you have this on the back page of the map so you can look at both
but the table on the back of the map it shows the distances between some of the cities that are on the map
boys and girls how come diagonal down the middle there is zeros there cause they
i was going to say you re already there you re already there what were you going to say there s nothing there i was also going to say that s the same thing as what said what disability say
like you re already there you re already there same thing cause it the same going across and down but they do cause you re already there okay
when you go down and it doesn t matter what because okay j because if you look it says boston mass boston mass and that s both the same place so it s right where you are
yep so how come i ll have to show you up here but look on your maps how come this is 446 and this is 446
1154 see because if you look diagonal you look like this the other is hm i wonder why
because what because it s the same it s the say that again it really is it s the same as this one what s the same the numbers why let s see if we can figure it out
j it starts at boston yeah so every time i was trying to play the distance from boston then it tells a 0 to tell you that s where boston is on the okay would we always start in boston though i mean i know we are in boston
we re going to do a trip together just to practice different
my answer is just like s because if hm so that s why it s the same are you telling me that the cities listed vertically are the same cities listed horizontally
no kind of because this way they re still the same as boxed in so it s the same cause you can see it s just the okay well i think that what is trying to say is see this row like boston mass is right here but this is and then right here is boston mass okay
i think the 0 represents the boston mass 446 represents washington dc where that s the question
represent can you all find that what does it represent like the miles from washington from boston what do you have out
away and my next question did you hear what said no could you say that again
represent washington from boston did you hear what he said say turn around so i can hear you
he said washington do you agree words and speak up a little bit honey i m having trouble hearing you
that s the mileage to washington and to boston well said
back we just okay okay good i think it tells you how many miles you have to drive to get to another city right that s what the whole chart tells you
chart in social studies when we look at some of those maps they may have mileage charts on them also together let s see where should we start
else orlando florida okay s we re leaving from orlando and where should we go
me los angeles los angeles okay desk all the way around with your knees under your desk and you can leave the attitude at the door
see 570 570 do you agree i saw doing math to figure that out do we have to do math to figure out the mileage from one city to the next no how can we find out the mileage from one city to the next city
z how did you figure that out because listen to
orlando florida when you go down you see los angeles and there it says okay
next i went down to los angeles and you saw can everybody see that it you can all see it
okay so the 1st leg of our trip was 2513 miles okay if we re in los angeles california where should we go next pardon me washington dc
it so where are we now angeles she started in right
and we went to and it was 2513 miles
okay and how far is it well we have to start in los angeles
so so can you find the city of los angeles on do you want to go across here and now we have to go down to washington dc
mileage 2000 2655
good okay city
next okay from michigan where are we now
j washington did you hear him washington right washington dc washington that s right well we have to go over to washington dc right
over hm and then we have to read the chart down to how many miles is that 666 right okay and now we have to go home
go back to go back to
cause we went we went to washington and then we we started at the very beginning of our trip
well we started at orlando then we went to nashville and now we re going to go home where was our home
no florida do you remember i said we were going to pretend we d start from somewhere else okay 0 all right from so we re going to go back to orlando florida
it 88 cause i started at nashville and i went down to orlando and found the 88
together what s a good strategy how shall i add all of these together i d the 1000s so 1000s 1st
have 4 okay so we have 2000 +2000 do add the 100s the 100s so we have 500 plus what s next
600 +600 600 +600 wow me can we use multiplication for these 3
yes 1800
2300 no and right next add the 10s the 10s how many 10s here
how shall we put those together
add the 10 to the 80 90 and then add 50 and 60
good that s 200 next add the ones the ones
lesson put those books away and how rude away is 9 okay and the 5 and 8 equals 13
13 +8 equals 22 do add 4000 and 2300 okay 4000 +2300 equals
equals 6300 okay now 6300 +200 200 equals 6500
22 22 equals 6522 is this what everyone else got label miles miles
okay boys and girls could you look at the next page 27 this yes anymore i will certainly help you if you have questions but please read those directions to yourself
4727 i m sorry
after i m sorry is it 47
47 well go from the other end carefully okay directions then i m going to have someone tell them to me
anymore you have to learn how to do that on your own
question i think i m going to have start
when you can explain that to the class without looking at it please let us know wait a minute come on
you would know if i m doing this and somebody s sharpening the pencil it s not a good time to talk right okay
you on page 26 and can you hear him if he was on the playground you would be able to i m sure you re going to have to speak up
they want you to work on and pick 3 cities that you want to go to okay
okay boys and girls the question before some of you may start from boston that is where we are but you could start from somewhere else okay is anybody planning on starting from somewhere else yeah okay good okay begin and you can talk to your group people if you need to
i ll sit over here raise your hand if you get stuck yes what if it says here if you finish your trip is it the last place you want to visit or when you drive back to the place you started
now do you know how to get started yeah yeah yes nope the bahamas is not in the united states
i was trying to make sure and can you pick anywhere you want
minute right here i happen to know that s erie pennsylvania can you pick that yes i don t know you don t know can you tell how many miles it is from boston to erie pennsylvania
no so could we pick that and make an addition problem yeah i guess where are we going to get the numbers so we are limited to what you have to dallas yes annapolis orlando washington and boston yes
going to boston you can t do that well like right now i m starting in boston and i m ending in boston how many miles did i go
0 right even though you know i can drive around the city and go a few miles right but i don t call that if i drive to a grocery store or to school i don t call that a trip
it yeah i bumped it on a glass table i put a cold rag on it but 1st it was a little bump and then yeah it s so delicate yes hm well you finish your trip where you started it right so where are you starting
finish where are you going to go back to okay and how many cities are you supposed to choose
okay so i see nashville tennessee you re going to have to squeeze a few more cities in there what s wrong stuck how come
because i you think you can do this last one and then i can send you to the nurse after okay do you need any help getting started yes you finish your trip
started you have to come back home if i get do you just add 46 to it
say so you re going to have to squeeze a few more cities in here right
visit you need 3 more well there s already one so how many more okay teacher yes cause then you have to go home
good yes are we supposed to put more than one city here what did the directions say it says write at least 3 cities but said we re supposed to write only one
to did you choose 3 cities
okay we re going to be working on following the directions
work what s that let me see the front from boston if you have to go look at this did you read these directions because it is such a problem in this class choose at least 3 cities for your complete road trip
that and then you re going to nashville right she can read it too cause you have yours in front of you
in i got my answer 7 yep i m done is there a label on it
trip boston to orlando hm yes did you do 2 trips
see we re going to share when we re done do we have to share yeah so when i look at this page and you went from los angeles to florida florida can you check this over
this work here is not up to standard okay this work was rushed through it s not 4th grade work it orlando okay back to boston say choose at least 3 cities
is this 3 cities no
out good have fun
so let s see all you did the map fine so let s do the geography a little bit okay
there water i don t mind that this is here right yeah and the map doesn t have those routes like the did okay route 75 or route 95 i m good
so i have a trip yeah and also where did you start from 1st texas dallas and then you left from dallas and you went to i went to washington dc
okay and then you left washington dc and you went to orlando florida and then you went back home to good so make sure you can get in your head where you went on the map okay
yes are we supposed to add going back to home i think you should unless are you moving i m trying to get from seattle to denver but then seattle to denver and then back to seattle that doesn t follow this rule though so this is 12 cities
and then i m going back to seattle well that s the same city so i think you have to go from seattle to denver and then go from denver somewhere else and then you can go back to seattle it says pick 3 cities right 2 and when you do it this way you re doubling a number right
back well i add this one so all i have to do is erase this and add something and then add something else and then i m yeah right you could just write the other city over here honey okay cause this says so put 2 cities on here and go back to seattle okay
good how come you re erasing from boston to los angeles was how many miles that s 200 and look on your chart boston to los angeles 3984 okay
are you going to have that written on your paper somewhere so you can add it that teacher i ll be sharing in a minute geography can you follow it with your finger
minutes teacher i found out why the zeros are on there why because if you tried to go boston to boston you can t cause you re already there right and washington dc to washington dc you can t orlando good so where am i going to see this number written down on your paper
here i m waiting okay so now you re in los angeles and where are you going next
that 2000 2006
didn t yeah we ll get to decimals pretty soon and you can say a lot of ands
yes is he talking to himself or to you or to question figure it out okay now other kids were talking too
no and everybody s welcome in this class am i right don t and we don t have to like anyone but we have to respect them okay because i was looking at you start denver denver colorado
hm okay went how many miles was it
now say that one more time without the and 879 then you left dallas and you went to
california los angeles no because he gets he will have to go back how many miles from dallas texas to los angeles california
1000 1430 34 okay
then you left los angeles california and went back to denver you did
okay and how many miles from los angeles california to denver colorado
again 1018 1018 does everybody agree
along does everybody agree yes i m glad one or 2 of you were today for some people
you yes 1018 yeah because he went from here to here yes both of the places he visit and then the different places yep
so he went 2 places and then came home right that was the directions
okay boys and girls since so many of you used the traditional algorithm i want to try this way and combine s way plus the traditional algorithm
1000s if i just add the 1000s 2000 now if i just add the 100s
400 eyes up here 1200 yes
100s do you know another way to say this number 1200 without the and 10s 30 +70 is
100 and 100 +10 is 110 110 right ones 4 +8 is 12 12 +9 is
32 it s like 12 +10 and then -one 10 and then just -one
good and now we can add this just using the traditional algorithm cause all the carrying s sort of done so we have a one in the ones column a 3 a 30 in the 10s column a 3 a 300 in the 100s column
3331 miles miles okay boys and girls we will work on this again a little bit tomorrow but your homework is going to be more close to 100 stuff
okay so working with the and just addition strategies okay but we will get to talk about this a little more in geography when we re looking at north america and i do like this map because it gives you a lot of the landmarks in our country you know going from coast to coast top to bottom
yes in a minute
all right get your math homework out 1st all right let s take a look
us again what was the formula for finding the area excuse me finding the volume of a rectangular prism length times width times height now everything i told you yesterday don t be scared about it it they have given you the length the width the height okay
so all you have to do is multiply it 2 you have a length of 6 centimeters a width of 6 centimeters and a height of 2 centimeters what is your volume for that i got 96 cubic centimeters any question about that
c i got 90 cubic centimeters okay j i got 36 cubic centimeters number 5 27 cubic centimeters correct have a question okay
j 112 cubic centimeters 0 excuse me 112 cubic meters me you re telling me no it s 57 i m saying no it s meters 0 sorry all right let s go on
me 48 cubic meters yes 48 cubic meters what about number 8 147 cubic centimeters i got something different from 147 what did you get
189 cubic centimeters if you had 7 times 3 that would give you 21 21 times 9 that should give you 9 times one is 9 okay okay number 9 what s the volume
196 cubic meters correct 196 cubic meters
volume 87 cubic meters cubic 0 centimeters correct that you re just going across this was a table you just had to go across you looked at the length 3 the width 4 the height 7
volume okay i got confused you all were looking at the column 0 dear no what are you going to do with 4 different lengths together to find the volume i just got confused even after i went over it yesterday okay
11 i gave you a length of 84 5 i don t know my height but i know the volume is 90 cubic meters 30 not 30
30 so 30 times what gives you 90 okay guys where s your head not you answer paper should be on your desk with the answers
you don t have them that s fine but have it out on your desk 30 i m asking you 30 times some missing number is going to give you 90 and that missing number would be 3 so the answer for number 11 is 3 meters
cubic you re only doing cubic when you get to your volume length i know the width is 4 the height is 7 and the volume is 84 guess what did you get for the length 3 meters that is correct 3 meters
13 i know the length is 6 centimeters i don t know the width i know my height is 4 centimeters i know the volume is 72 centimeters take a guess on that one c 3 centimeters 3 centimeters any question about that other than the mass confusion of going straight down in a column instead of the row
all right let s put this away volume i told you to make sure you bring scissors if you don t have scissors you re going to have to borrow scissors share with someone et cetera okay
i m going to let you work with a partner and as you re working with a partner today we re going to explore boxes explore cubes talk about the volume here of these cubes
particular what s the relationship of the size of the box and the number of cubes it will hold and then we re also going to figure out how does the volume change as the dimensions of the box change
bit what are dimensions it what are dimensions dimensions are the length width and height of your actual cube your actual rectangular prism
what we re going to do today is explore with boxes okay we re going to explore with boxes so what i m going to do is let you work with a partner and i m going to give you 3 different sets of some cubes
do okay 1st you re going to have to do what it so i have tape at each of the tables and you and your partner work together
c you re going to work with a partner and cut out the patterns for the open cubes one after you ve done that we re going to measure each open cube and record the findings in the chart
journal i will move it and you will copy this chart in your journal okay you re going to fill after you ve done all the measuring what do you think you re going to measure with one over there okay making sure you understand that okay then you re going to fill each cube each box the open cube with centimeters cubes
i have centimeter cubes over there and you re going to count them to find out the volume you re going to record your findings here and then we re going to discuss the 1st thing we re going to do is cut it out and tape it together
what measure it with a ruler then you re going to fill it with the centimeter cubes l yes but why open cube what do they mean by that
take one spot and open it take those little cubes it s going to be open open that s it that that s weird how is that weird but simple simple but trying to trick you but they re really not
so remember you have 3 different cubes okay take one pass it down as soon as i have finished passing out all of the patterns for these cubes then you can get with a partner if you would like to as i m passing out go ahead and draw your chart in your journal
okay soon as you get yours you may go ahead it you may get started as soon as you get all of yours it that s the 3rd one i just passed
are you sure you don t have one a bs take a c pass the cs c you don t have a c yet
them here is the c what does the partner have to be at your table no the partner does not have to be at your table all right everyone should have 3 different cubes an a a b a c sorry go ahead
chart go ahead and cut your cubes out tape the tape will be at the tables and don t use a 4 inch piece of tape for one little side
here thank you yes
off carry them back carry them correctly okay you re welcome you floated away
go it s right there make sure you put them back at the desk okay let s go quickly
now you all are wasting time thinking about a partner instead of starting this
do you have a question it s okay cut it
doesn t have to be perfect it does have to be perfect i said it doesn t have to be perfect what did you say
you might not want to because they re all 3 different
someone there you go name does anyone not have partner
go there has a partner she didn t say she didn t have a partner partner i just asked who doesn t have a partner and you didn t raise your hand
okay 0 let s go
yours 0 boy 0 boy
what have you got here where have you been
that s better all right there are go get one right now
okay
you should be cutting the cubes together sides you need to have them open so you can fill it 1st i have given you the centimeter cubes but you re not doing that 1st
remember you cut the patterns the open cubes fold up the seals measure with a ruler before you start filling it measure with a ruler okay measure with a ruler
folks you all can use cubes from there
what s wrong what s wrong he s saying you are measuring have you cut all of these 1st then you re going to measure
let s go y all share all right let s go you all are going to have to share the tape with one of these other tables
make sure you record these dimensions record it in a chart
probably would be best considering we re going to make a comparison in centimeter cubes 1st thing to measure number 2 measure the dimensions
dimensions please someone had a very wise idea over here
they labeled because i can tell you that some of you are going to go i don t know which one is which so it might be beneficial for you to label now you have to put it together with tape and leave it open so you re not going to do this last part right here
you re going to do that but you re not going to tape here does that make sense leave it open there s tape at all 3 tables so you have to go to that table and use the tape at those tables
there are cubes at all 3 tables
still someone would still go i don t know what s which it would still be beneficial to know that there s a difference
care why don t you ask one of them to borrow the scissors if you re waiting they should be 0 so nice and let you borrow them
sweet thank you
time what are you measuring with how are you starting
30 how do you measure at 30
half what did you 5 and a half centimeters but what did you measure did you measure the length the width or the height
okay here is a great kind of predictor for you to know where you should be at this time you have about 5 more minutes maybe 7 max to be able to get these together are you need to start cutting faster putting together faster and stop the conversation
5 to 7 minutes to finish putting your cubes together i already measured mine and they re all the same should she measure hers to make sure they re all the same or just copy
see it comes together like that open it would be nice if you could just shove it in
it you don t have to put them all together though do you do not throw them in but can you place them nice and neatly in there
yes okay let s finish
thank you
finish no you have 3 cubes because you put all of them together me you put them all together
dimension okay step let s do it volume the length the width and the height that s it
since these are centimeter cubes which side do you think you should use all right everybody freeze for me for a 2nd ruler remember when you are using this ruler especially these don t start all the way at the end because there s a little gap in between the end and the 0
so you have to make sure that you always measure starting at what 0 make sure you do that you have about 4 more minutes to make sure you have all of your cubes cut and put together
up does it count if it s a little oversized this is approximate is it closer to 5 5 are they all going to be cubic already or is it just centimeters and because you re multiplying all 3 together it s cubic
0 what are you missing unfortunately i don t have another c because someone lost their c and i didn t have an extra here s the thing
c whose is this that s not mine that s the c no it s not hers i have no clue what has happened
you all work together just using the c estimate why are you using inches the reason i m asking you this is what are these
go get some water then come back and let s get it together i m asking because these are what what kind of cubes are they
what centimeters so if you re going to make a comparison would it be easier to use the centimeters side or the inches side centimeters so let s use the centimeters yes ma am what s up
you if it s 4 and a half how do you show the halves how do we show halves when we have decimals anytime you get to half it s always going to be what 0.50 yeah
that that s it if you re showing this 4 and 5 tenths 4.5 4.5 4.5 then take that and multiply it by 4.5
huh because 5 tenths wait this is what i m saying to you okay guys finish now in silence
i m telling you you re telling me it s 4.5 times 4.5 times 4.5 it s just like multiplying decimals when you did it a while back take that and multiply times 4.5 again
that because a and c have halves b is the only one that doesn t so b i measured just fine okay so c what happens you re telling me that it s 4 and a half yes did you try 4 and a half
4 yes but there was space around it okay no you can t cut it do think about what you could do to fix it what what s 5 times 5
25 carry the 2 5 times 4 20 +2 so use that 20 carry the 2 4 times 4 2 yes
away there you go you yes you can measure 1st
up this is 5 right i don t know
finish yes ma am can that be the answer let s see this is what you came up with multiplying okay 5 2 one 9 9
it it doesn t work like that with the decimal does it
it has a decimal here so you wouldn t have to have a decimal in your answer because you have a decimal here in these dimensions correctly okay we don t even have enough to fill our thing did you ever find c
no that s fine all right at this point we should have some measurement going on with the ruler you need to move on from measuring with the ruler to actually using the cubes at this point we are looking at only about 15 more minutes to finish this up
around now it s time to stop playing around let s go and see what happens if that means that you were way behind that means you and your partner are going to have to come up with a plan
done this is the big one right b okay what about a
did you try a figure out how you can make a work
these they re not going to be perfect ever
it make it 5 and a half how do you what you can t multiply decimals you ve never multiplied decimals in your life
do we do centimeters or inches if these are centimeters what do you think would be easiest go this is width and this is height right i didn t see where your width was this was width this was length and this was height okay
i got the measurement from 0 to between the 4 and the 5 so what would that be
and we came up with did you use one layer no that s what you re supposed to do 1st is measure with the ruler that s what i ve been saying for the past what yes
cubes does that go with these yeah and how do they go
wait wait how do you want to measure that baby have you ever seen any of my measurements i ve been showing you this week like that haven t you seen them kind of like this though so maybe we should try to make them more like that
yes don t you think that s going to benefit you more than what you re doing just asking do we have to fill the whole thing up could you give an estimate without filling the whole thing up i guess okay so figure out how you can do an estimate
there 16 figure out how many layers you re going to have to have and then what would that be 16 what s your length 4
layers so multiply 4 times 4 then 16 times 4 64 does that work out to be what you have there
so one of the things you could do is just do the bottom and figure out how many layers you re going to have that s one way
figure out what s the relationship here between the length and how many cubes you re putting inside
me then we did the height we measured it 5 centimeters then the width and the volume was this we just leave 0.5 over here you re going to have to multiply 4 times 5 then we have to multiply 20 times 4.5
take it back to what we did a long time ago with decimals you have to multiply 20 times 4.5 like that okay
a what was your measurement when you used the ruler what was the length what was the width 4 4 now let s look at the cubes can i do it
4 what s the width 4 4 now how many cubes did it take you to fill this up
64 so what s the volume 64 cubic centimeters when you measure you got 4 4 and 4 volume 64 cubic centimeters now what you re going to have to do which we re going to have to pick up with tomorrow you re going to have to write and tell me what s the difference
what s the relationship between the size of this box and the number of cubes it will hold how does the volume change as the dimensions of the box change one what happened when you went from a to b b to c
you have to write that and get on the right track up actually 5 times 2 is 10
holder 4 times 0 is 0 and 4 times 2 is 8 so then you should have had one place after the decimal okay the answer is what 90 okay everyone freeze no more getting cubes
seat okay so this lesson just have a seat this lesson obviously takes us more than just the one day that we have one because of cutting slow cutting process 2 because of the putting together process and 3 because of being able to measure and fill it with cubes and go through that process
where i see that a lot of you have forgotten even after i reminded you was the fact that you were supposed to measure 1st okay i realize that a lot of you came up with some half measurements then you were supposed to fill the cube and we were going to talk about the relationship between the 3 of them
i need you to freeze 2nd time i said it because it s not going to happen good some of us are not quite there yet and we re going to get there so we re going to continue this on tomorrow
please make sure one that you get all of your cubes put them back into the cup so that they can go back in my container in a minute 2 make sure you keep your cubes all together another 3 make sure you bring them back to me tomorrow
as you are doing that tell me what have you noticed thus far from this process all of the cubes have a different size and are going to have a different volume all 3 cubes different sizes probably going to have a different volume
c listening for c and a you can t use the cubes to make them because there s half marks and you can t cut the cubes in half okay see like for a it was 4 and a half and for the others that were bigger possibly
we ll soon find out for those of us that especially have to finish okay all right so what you re doing one place the cubes back into my container here even this since i already made it that no this one is finished but you haven t written anything with it
together 2 make sure my scissors make sure the rulers get back where they should go okay we will finish
do you want 2 30 or do you want 2 30 works should work thank you thank you very much do they like take your picture with that yeah they just to make sure everything is right i see no it is not a mug shot
today we are going to start our fractions unit fractions that thinking there is a piece missing its numerator and denominator there is a numerator and a denominator we have a top number is called the numerator numerator good and the bottom number is the denominator denominator
c they cut up in halves like if it is a triangle they will put it into halves halves would be one certain fraction cut yeah today we are going to explore 4 centers but you will only be doing 2 of them quickly 1st one is ttqa multiplication
ourselves that is something we have been working on all week i am sorry all school year b turn the question around turn the question around so for this activity you are given a fraction word problem your job is to figure out the word problem and supply your answer using ttqa
for example the 1st one says has 8 pencils end what fraction of the pencils do not have erasers at the end be 3 of them do not out of 8 so what would the fraction be it is 3 out of 8 so what would the fraction be boys and girls hands
it is 3 eighths 3 eighths very good i do not want you answer just to be 3 eighths if you turn the question around the answer would be 3 eighths of the pencils do not have erasers at the end
here group you need to raise your hand center number 2 what part is it this one you are given a paper that looks like this and it has all the different colors that you will need green please just use the materials at table 2
own so the 1st thing you are going to do is color the design according to the colors written in the box directions then you are going to answer the questions that follow design once you have this part finished you are going to go on the back and you are going to create your design using any 3 colors that you would like
so you are going to make i made a design here design when you are finished you are going to make your own design and answer questions about your own design does everyone understand yes that is center number 2 it is called what part is it and your objectives are there b these are all going to be cooperative learning yes
center number 3 vocabulary concentration raise your hand if you have ever played concentration before or memory cards you will know the difference between the 2 decks
this they are the same word and definitions in each set so do not mix them up understand so if you have 5 people at your group you can do a group of 2 and a group of 3 playing the game you are flipping them all over and then you need to match the vocabulary word with the definition one vocabulary word might be numerator might be denominator might be fraction
and then you have to match it to the definition that goes along with it does everyone understand vocabulary concentration yeah so again there will be 2 games that can go on at once here and lastly number 4 i have who has
no i have who has is a game finished i have who has is a list of cards and every card looks like this i have who has so you are going to read i have and what would we call this fraction the one that is colored in
fraction this fraction here this 10 what is that called how many are colored in
one and how many are there all together 44 so it is going to be called one who can i forgot the name it is one out of 4 so it is going to be called one you want to help him out
14th 14th so you would pick up your card and you would read i have 14th who has 5 sixths that is why it is called i have who has and then you are going to everyone in your group is going to have their own set of cards and you are going to have to look through your cards and see if you have 5 sixths the way we are going to play it is you are going to lay them all on the floor right over here and so i would say i have 14th who has 5 sixths i would place this one on the floor
would say i have 5 sixths if that was the hand that she had yes it is kinda like fractions go fish kind of like fractions go fish how do you deal the cards out you are going to just separate them you can just do it one for you one for you one for you one for you until you have none left over in your stack number does everyone understand this game yeah
yes it is like this one is a multiplication problem pretend that is 24 it is like what this is like a multiplication problem because there is 4 tables in the room there are 4 tables and what 4 tables in the room and so it would be 4 times what
4 times but there are only 5 people at each group so it would be 4 times 4 times what group 5 it should be 4 times 5 equals 20 there does everyone understand the 4 centers
yeah while you are working i am going to call your group over at teacher table to work with me on some fraction activities so i am setting this center 4 over here on the floor cause you need to line them up in one big long piece there remember do not look for your answers until you have it finished
yes no cause i do not think you are going to be taking anything with you other than that one paper in i have you have like if the person that has a fraction do they have to have it on top on the bottom i mean on the top where it says i have
number the number to start with on i have who has is 2 thirds so once you deal out your cards the person who has 2 thirds is the starter r so the card that you showed it said 14th who has 56th would that person say i have 56th who has exactly any questions
i did not know what that means what you said working with a group yes you are working together as a group c like once somebody 2 cards they are laying out in a row so you are going to have the 1st one we had i have 14th who has 56th and if you have it you would say i do i have 56th you are going to put it next to it and you are going to have a question below
who has 2 fourths then the 2 fourths person will say i have 2 fourths they will put it down who has 18th it will end up making a big long chain where someone have to answer every time
row so do you say who has point the bottom number what if you have them that is okay you would have to say i have it
correctly you are going to work on the center that you are sitting at right now one bring your chair up please and i am going to take team 3
please can i sit over here so i will not block it one he is at team 2
we are going to start working with making fractions right now
so the 1st thing i want you to do is to tell me what this fraction is
in what would you think maybe what does it look like in you do not have to count
like it looks like how much of the sandwich it looks like a triangle i do not see a triangle do you mean a rectangle yeah 0 a rectangle i am going to show you like this pretend i cut my sandwich can i cut my sandwich like this
good so everyone agrees that this is called half over here yes i would like you to cut yours in half just like mine pencil shade it in just like me the whole rectangle is it is 6 times 4 because there is 6 in this row and there is 4 rows so it is 24
right so just told us that this array is a what by what
4 if it a 6 by 4 rectangle how many pieces are in there all together inside what would you say the area was
4 6 times 4 agree yes do you agree that there are 24 pieces inside of this
good if there are 24 pieces inside and we just colored in half of them how many do you think we should have colored in 24 24 divided by 2 12 teacher 12
good so half of 24 is going to be 12 because we know 12 +12 is 24 that yes i want you to use the other rectangle that is next to it and i want you to cut that sandwich in half a different way and so remember our rule is if it is half you must have to color in how many
one half one half which is how many 12 so you have to cut it so that you end up with 12 on one side and 12 on the other i do not think i am going to be here tomorrow 0 you are not feeling well
what the bubble we were catching it and then it went in my mouth and it is a special kind of bubble so most of you colored in you split it horizontally meaning side by side in how many did you color in
yes yes in order to be half you have to have the same amount on one side that there is on the other numbers right you would not be able to the next thing i want to do is i want you to cut this next rectangle into fourths so now there are 4 people eating this sandwich
sandwich now for this 3rd rectangle there are going to be 4 people that would like a part of the sandwich and all parts have to be equal
them color in what you were going to eat if you were one of the 4 pieces and color in one of them
you would not be able to do it like that right diagonal we are going to talk about it i do not want to miss the super party we are not talking about that right now we are doing fractions right now
yeah are they all equal yep yes so it looks like the 3 of you cut your sandwich like this piece how many were in that one piece
66 do you agree 6 way cut his sandwich so that it looked like this he had 1234 do they look like they are equal parts
yes how many are in each 1123456 too so why do not you add the one that we did or the one that they did on your 2nd one there so do is way and will do your way
now we have shown 2 ways to make fourths i have a 3rd way to make it
now i would like you to try to find a 3rd way to make fourths so go down to your next box your next sandwich and try to find another way that you could cut that sandwich so that 4 people would be eating the same exact amount and there can not be any leftovers so pretend you are the chef and your client says we would like a sandwich but we want you to cut it for 4 people to share
and you can not do it this way and you can not do it this way you have to come up with another way chef chef m try to find another way to cut it for your clients
that is my go ahead i just found it would have worked i love fractions you love fractions person is 66 so just keep that in mind
when you are making these pieces there should be how many in each person is 6 do we need another eraser is that what the problem is over here here i know we got some erasers for you find another way to cut your sandwich into fourths that everyone has the same amount
those erasers do not work that well these do not i used them and it leaves a pink mark sometimes 0 it does yeah just try your best it will the lead does not erase well just for erasing pencil just use your regular pencil though come on
work so tell me show me where you cut them here one pieces how many pieces are you supposed to have
44 so that will not work will it you have 12345 you have 6 let us see yours right 123456
44 very good in why do not you pick 4 colors cause we are making fourths each person can be a color
yourself i will make a sample for you
this you do not want to pick the same colors as me but color them to prove that there are 4 separate pieces and each piece needs to be the same amount pieces fractions are equal pieces would they be equal if we would do it like this how could we prove if it is equal they all the same the same what squares yeah you know how many is the same
good so if you can prove that then that would be equal so you would color color in each person is section a different color fourths in order to prove they are fourths we have to have how many squares inside of them
6 it can not look like this and it can not look like this
that now use this red and color in another 6
piece what are you working on i was figuring out if i could diagonal well let us see work i do not think you are drawing diagonal though 0 it is an opposite number you are right quickly i just gave her this sample
1st color in any 6 but your 6 can not look like this and it can not look like this
may did your group start with 2 thirds yeah are you all lined up now
now yeah now put a different color and color in another 6 just color in 6 color in any 6 but it can not be a group that looks like this and it can not be a group that looks like this did you color yours in yet
not yet you need to color them in colors but can it be like up top instead but you just can not cut your sandwich like this
yes we are working on this one so now you that is a piece that is a piece that is a piece and the small one is a piece color can we make another way yeah if you are ready to go on you can make another way
i need one more thank you why do not you just start by coloring in 6 pieces
this 123456
way can i make it with a different color they will not be the same but now you have to pay attention to what you are doing because now you take away to cut these into 6 but they had to be connected this so 123456
color teacher this way what a coincidence i had this let me see
thinking try another one together let us look at is for a 2nd had one going but then she kind of did not plan ahead and she ended having this one purple could you cut a sandwich that had a piece of sandwich and then like this random piece over here
together try the next one so that you know try to work on one too
i made an awkward way but it is equal it can be kind of weird looking make another one not yet
minute now how many did you color in with gray no too many right yeah so if we take off some there now you are up to 6 that would work
ways once you start exploring there are a lot of different ways to cut this into equal fourths i just had trouble cause i thought they had to be no that would not work cause you left those 2 by themselves right yes i just thought cause i thought they had to look the same like this no they can all look different 0 as long as they are like the same number as long as they are worth the same
same perfect i am missing good i am missing so we are kinda moving away from thinking of fractions as perfect pieces usually we see fractions that look like this and like this but now we are moving onto finding some really interesting ones like had
as long as each piece is worth the same they are broken into equal fractions one and again they are all worth they already have 6 inside of them rule the last thing i want to do before we leave before i send you back to your group is i want to do some adding fractions with you half go up to your one half that we started with in that 1st top left box
in this one we are going to write a number sentence for that it is going to be one half plus what was the other side one half one half equals 2 halves it equals 2 halves
c and 2 halves is the same as one whole down one half +one half equals one whole and let us move to the one below it we had 14th plus what else did we add for this one
we did 14th +one over 414th +plus another 14th plus very good one how many fourths do you see here in this one
do you see how many fourths 44 so what we are doing when we are adding is we are adding the numerator we are adding one +one +one +one which equals 44 and your denominator which is your bottom number is going to stay the same it is what they are called
called denominators fourths fourths so that is their name so their name does not change they are called fourths we are not going to add our 4th a lot of people they would add 4 +4 +4 +4 and get sixteenths these are not called sixteenths they are called fourths so we always keep our denominator the same cause that is their name
change well you can change it sometimes name they are called fourths you are not going to change them all to sixteenths it is kind of like when we are describing things when we do ela noun so we might have 10 dogs 11 dogs 12 dogs 13 dogs
the top number might change but the bottom number the noun they are always going to be 4th fourths they are going to stay fourths and 4 fourths equal 84 fourths how many do your 4 fourths all together equal how much is this whole thing worth the whole sandwich is one whole
whole 4 fourths make all of it tomorrow this is just kind of a start to us looking at fractions a different way other than the perfect half and the perfect fourths they can be cut all different ways as long as each piece is worth the same
i am going to start doing that when i am making sandwiches 0 you are going to start cutting them into different ways as long as they are the same amount because you do not want someone to get a teeny tiny piece and someone get a large piece they are all to get the same amount but how would you know how much are in each sandwiches it is just a sandwich it would be hard to do it for a real sandwich if i give my brother a little piece he is going to go you guys can head back to your desks
folder take your folder with you when your center is cleaned up and ready for the next group you may walk to your next center
one and actually 4 you can head over to the teacher table
center see if you can work to have your group work more quietly at this next activity if you finish this activity you may finish the one that you just started before go ahead
no can i grab another pack of markers no you could use crayons we are over here and we are going to start working with some fractions
so the 1st thing i want you to do is put your name on the paper
designs yeah that was fun we are going to start working with sandwiches over here rectangles and instead of them being rectangles pretend that each one is a sandwich chefs and we are going to practice cutting the sandwiches into equal pieces for the people that we made food for
pieces no how many pieces wo 22 equal pieces so go ahead and take this 1st sandwich and cut it as if you are the chef into 2 equal pieces
color in each piece a different color please quick quick quick color them quickly one person will be one color color quick coloring do they have to be color in all the way just quick coloring would be perfect
are quick coloring middle and you cut it in 2 separate sides how much is one side worth as we are talking about fractions
half write that below it is one half one half we can add a math symbol in between halves one half blank one half plus
together when we add one half +one half how much of our sandwich do we have one whole one whole put a large one go i would like you to break the next sandwich up the same way but i do not want them to look the same way so you are going to break it into halves but they can not look the same way that you did this one
way yeah i was just going to tell the other way go ahead and draw it and color it so again you have this sandwich and i want you to break it into 2 pieces for 2 people again
what one half plus write down one half +one half equals one whole i want you to turn and talk to your neighbor
so turn and talk to your neighbor of how do you know that you cut them in half perfectly how do you know that those are perfect halves ahead turn and talk for 30 seconds tell me how do you know that these are how do you know that these are perfect halves how do you know that they are
i know because explain that to me so it is 4 here so if i colored 21 color and 2 the other color that is even
12 and how many are there for yellow yes how many squares are there all together in your sandwich conversation what were you saying with
i knew that i split it evenly because i counted 4 this way and 6 this way 12 very good so you knew that if you broke it perfectly in half each person would have to eat how many h me and said because this is 4 times 6
so we just multiplied that and it equals 24 so we counted out 12 good right here it is all 12 and 12 so we added 12 and 12 perfect so everyone agrees that 12 +12 equals 24 and that is how we know they are perfect halves yes
sandwich so i need you to cut the sandwich into 4 equal pieces n cut your sandwich for your guests into 4 equal pieces 4 different colors 4 different colors so that each person has the equal amount just like you did for your halves that is the whole thing with fractions
pieces actually i do really make sandwiches so color each go you need 4 colors
work so you need 4 crayons to do quick coloring go what time is the camera leaving we are leaving at 2 30 we are not getting to this point yet
us it looks like everyone broke them up this way you drew one line vertically which means up and down and one line side to side horizontally did yeah i want you now to tell me what each piece is called
called they are not halves name 14th they are called fourths so now i would like you to write another math equation underneath that sandwich
different good you have 14th +14th does that make 0
right you said 14th +14th means 2 fourths everyone yeah i forgot to do that but your math is still correct absolutely fourths but i want you to make an equation for the whole sandwich so you need to have this 114th plus this one plus this one plus this one i want you to include math image for all of them like this and what does that equal
perfect you should have written i got 2 answers i got i saw someone write this
this i accidently i saw these 2 answers saw if you were the teacher what would you say if you saw people write this answer
partner what would you say if someone wrote this would this be correct 14th +14th +14th +14th equal one whole sandwich a 14th +14th +14th +14th all together was that your whole sandwich
114th +14th +14th +14th how many fourths are there 44 and are they called fourths yeah were these called fourths is this piece called the fourths yes
did you have 4 of them yeah yeah so would this be correct 4 fourths do you have 4 fourths yes think what does it look there is a new
options 0 the teacher would want you to write one whole instead of 4 fourths because like 4 fourths is like still a fraction but when it is also done you should really write one whole for it would you say that this correct yes would you say this is correct yes
so you would agree that both of them are correct but you just think a teacher would rather see this correct we think both are correct but the reason i read it 4 fourths is because you add the numerator perfect i love numerator which one was the numerator the top number or the bottom number
numerator it was the bottom no wait wait the top the top numbers one +one +one +one 4 and we are going to keep our denominator the same change so we get with 4 fourths that is exactly what i said 0 it is
good so when you see this how many different pieces are there 4th so is it true that you have 41 fourths
activity i want you guys to break the next sandwich up into fourths again but it can not look like this
up i want you to break it up into 4 equal pieces again but i do not want it to look like that another there are quite a few different ways that you could break your sandwich up to make it have fourths 4 fourths remember
here good we had to help the boys a little because they did not know that these were the answers and these were the questions can we check if this one is right i think it is right no
now yeah i do not get this one that much answer questions on the front on i did not get this one i did not get this one so you have to figure out what fraction of the whole design is each color 20 we did that 20 20 hello then you need to figure out how many are each color
2 so your fraction would be 2 out of 20 or 2 over 20 amount so now you can answer that part the fraction part form i am all set
thank you all right boys and girls listen up please all right can somebody tell me what have we been talking about for the past couple weeks
decimals and what exactly about decimals least to greatest putting them in order from least to greatest anything else anybody want to add to that j subtracting and adding decimals subtracting and adding decimals anybody else d multiplying we touched a little bit not too much on multiplying but we did touch upon multiplying
good all right so today we re going to review a little bit of what we have been doing pencil it s not i m going to give you a couple problems and i want you to work them out however is easier for you
so the 1st step in adding up these decimals what do we need to do with the decimal point put a 0 put a 0 next to the 22 next to the 2 good so i would add a 0 next to it and then i would do what with the decimal point
good in order to get an accurate answer you need to line up the decimal points can somebody raise your hand and tell me what you got for an answer form 66 hundredths good
66 hundredths excellent so if someone were to ask you to fill in 66 hundredths on this grid right here how many boxes would i fill in 66 you would fill in 66 boxes
in and that would give you the accurate answer when you fill that in
so we have 75 hundredths +6 tenths and there s 2 grids now instead of one what s the 1st step to do
it point wait .35 hundredths so you got .35 hundredths yes .35 hundredths no no no no one no 11.35 hundredths okay right 0 no yeah so i m going to do the same steps that you told me i m going to line up my decimal points and i m also going to add what
good line up my decimal points add a 0 so when we add it 5 +0557 +13 one.35 so now this is a little tricky now how would i fill this in the grids 1351 and 35 hundredths how would i fill that in the grid
d you d fill in one whole grid and then 35 in the other grid good you would shade in one whole grid and then you would fill in 35 boxes in the other one so if it s more than one you would fill in one whole grid all right does anybody have any questions on that
instead of taking it like that the 7 by 5 off 7 by instead of making the shapes that way so you make that 7 by 5 because it equals 35 no like an array 0 like an array
but if they give you a grid a hundredths grid and they want you to fill in the hundredths grid this is the way that you would fill it in if they ask you for an array yep yeah that s something different on all right so we re going to do a couple examples of expanded notation as well
all right so please put this example on your paper
paper is that a 9 too yeah 0 yeah 9 good i ll kind of walk around and see what you have
0 would you like to go up and show that i ll come back there on top
okay excellent perfect all right excellent can somebody raise your hand and tell me thank you you re welcome how would we read this number if i asked you to read this number how would you read it
r 43216 and 92 hundredths thousandths thousandths good so remember if the decimal form yeah it is fine so remember that the decimal point always means the word and 43216 and 92 thousandths excellent all right i m going to give you another example
and i like the way that you remembered to put a 0 to take the place of the tenths because they did not provide you a tenths place so you put a 0 there to take the place if you just put 92 it would say 92 hundredths you need to take the digits that excellent all right i m going to give you another problem the same way that we just did that expanded form
there is a couple numbers place values that are missing well i know about this no it s not right let me see so remember put a 0 to take the place if there is a place value missing
0 i get it the 17701 teacher 0 teacher that s not right check your answer put a 0 it s not 701
difficult good excellent if i got it right please don t ask me why i think i ve got it now
board okay good 0 good you can put that on the board your answer you can put up
huh it s what place is in the 100s place is there any number in the 100s place no no 0 expanded something in put 2 what it s not that one and it s not that one either so it s 701 minute boys and girls if there s no number in the 100s place put 0
yeah 0 i think that good he wasn t 0 that s too many numbers right there remember we re only doing thousandths 0 yeah thousandths 0 i know what it is no it can t teacher where is your number right there see
yeah is this the right yeah 0 what number is in the tenths place me the 8 the 8 and what do you have on your paper 00 it s 802 but the 0 is on the tenths place on your paper i know good all right so this one was a little bit more difficult so boys and girls we have 80000 +6000
86000 then we have 70 +one so it s not 700 confused so there needs to be one more 0 yeah there has to be a 0 in the 100s place 100s i know some of you got a little confused and you put the 7 where the 100s belong but just be careful when you see that if there s not a number in the 100s place put a 0 to take the place
point then we have an 8 in the tenths place so we put a 8 in the tenths place place there s nothing here that s given in the hundredths place so we need to put a 0 to take the place of the hundredths place
in thousandths thousandths place so the 2 belongs in the thousandths place does everybody see that number how do you say that decimal word form
b it s 86071 and 802 thousandths excellent 86071 and 802 thousandths thousandths remember this means and all right i m going to give you another one like this cause i think you guys saw your mistakes so let s see if you can try another one on your own
so remember if there s a place value that s missing you have to put a 0
it yeah can somebody tell me it s what place is this 1st one in good this is the 100000s but that s not in this example but it might be in the next 100000s it s what place is next to the 100000s
10000s 10000s what place is next to the 10000s good the 1000s so you can say 1000s what place is next to the 1000s on the 1000s the ones it s right next to the no wait 100s place 100s good and i m just going to write it on the bottom here
100s and what place is next to the 100s the 10s 10s good 10s with an s i ones the ones good and now we have the decimal point
what s the 1st place to the right of the decimal point tenths and what about 2 places over from the tenths the hundredths hundredths good and then thousandths did you say i said hundredths then thousandths hundredths then thousandths so hundredths and then thousandths so you know what
you can always make this on any of your papers to help you all right so you all should have done this problem by now on the top 10 yeah i had to throw it away because okay
now .609 yeah good shh quiet still working on it
in tenths it s in the tenths so 6 needs to go 9 thousandths so it needs to go in the tenths place
the 2 goes in the 10000s place there s nothing in the 1000s so we re going to the 0 over to the 1000s place place nothing in the 10s place so i m putting a 0 there to take the place of a 10s
place we have nothing in the hundredths place so i m going to put a 0 yep and a 9 in the thousandths place number 20503 and 609 thousandths good 20503 and 609 thousandths good raise your hand if you need another example
on comfortable yes 0 no i raise your hand if you want another example on one more example but it looks like the more practice you have the better that you re getting on this what i ll keep this number line up for you
that makes it so let s see here
so this is our last example 0 that s how okay last example big headache so i left the number line there for you to check it out
so what number do you have in the 100000s place there do you have a number 4 yes right there that s not the 100000s place go check your answer 0 that s 4040 it what number do you have in the 100000s place there s the number line
top good what number is in the 10000s place 0 no it s 480 so why do you have 408 there you got to fix that
go ahead write how you guys doing did you find it
i did can i write it on the board good good most of you have remembered to put a 0 i did when the number wasn t present
attention the 1st digit that s the value of each place number back what is it i thought you said that was wrong what was wrong 482 i thought it was 480 you said 480 was right no
2 you told me 4800 it s 482 let me see your paper maybe i misread the wrong one right here 480 and you said that was right nope yeah you switched out the numbers now all right good so can somebody tell me what number is in the 100000s place
4 good all right guys in the front row please the 4 is in the 100000s place it s what number is in the 10000s place 0 no no no 88 is the 10000s place then 2 guys please don t jump ahead
and the number in the 1000s or the 1000s 2 right in the 10s place 55 in the ones 44 tenths 00 there s nothing present in the tenths place actually this one okay did you have something different on your paper
did you copy it out wrong it s what number is in the tenths place 0 i think you copied it wrong yeah fine so what number is in the tenths place 0 i mean one i mean 5 wait a minute so what number is in the tenths place
you 00 is in the tenths place and then what number was in the hundredths place place the 9 the hundredths 0001 the one is in the hundredths place and the last place the thousandths i had the 9
was the 9 good does somebody want to raise your hand and read that number please
j 482000 i kind of like changed it 54 and good 482054 and 19 thousandths good
and yeah so all right it looks like we can kind of move on from this all right the next thing that i want to do is compare and ordering quickly all right you guys did a good job figuring out those
so you re going to copy these down and put them in order from least to greatest i love these i hate these the order is so the trick that i told you what you need to do to make your life a little bit easier is what
add zeros add zeros it s a lot easier to see when you add zeros if they all are on the thousandths place it s easier to see so that should be easier to put in order from least to greatest right is that a 6 nope it s a i ll just so from least to greatest
yeah least to greatest that s zeros so remember you start looking at the ones place then the tenths the hundredths and the thousandths from least to greatest least to greatest teacher can i just do it on your paper least to greatest so that s what we re doing now
job so the numbers in order from least to greatest and again add zeros so it s easier for you
questions i did it it 0 least to greatest good yeah
good okay

greatest 1000th because this has all the zeros the next number 0.110.11 how do you say that 11 thousandths 11 thousandths you said 0.11 so are you .011 okay
and that s 11 thousandths good 11 thousandths the 3rd number can i go after you tell me what the 3rd number is please the 3rd number is 0.100 that say if i had blocked out the zeros a 100 thousandths you could say a 100 thousandths or what one
or one if those zeros weren t there you could say one what 110th 10th 10th 10th good right and the last number can somebody read me what the last number is
110 thousandths 110 good 110 thousandths and say if i took away the 0 how would you read that number now
yep so you know that they are equal good 11 hundredths is equal to 110 thousandths any questions on this
again the left to write again it gets hard when some of the digits are the same but that s what you re going to see so i did this if they have like so if they have same if they what
0 please put those numbers in order from least to greatest paper zeros yeah that s what you need to do on your paper okay okay so you re going to do that on your paper
too but because i m working with the digit 9 it makes it harder cause there s so many 9s it would probably be a lot easier have a seat teacher may use the bathroom once the pass comes you may go back okay
out so you re putting those numbers in order from least to greatest i got it
b 9 thousandths 9 thousandths if i said the greatest number it s you can tell right away 9 duh right away you know this is the greatest number because this has a 0 that has a 0 this is a 0 that has a 0 this is the greatest number it s in the ones place
right and i told you to add zeros to make it a little bit easier for this one you could have done it also these are just extra zeros there it s remember every whole number there s like an invisible 0 there so if i gave you the number 14 it s like there s always a decimal point there we just don t write it so there s always an invisible that right there is equal to that
thing all 3 numbers these are all equal we just don t have a decimal point down can somebody tell me what the 1st number is yeah 9 thousandths good 9 thousandths this right here is the least number
it has zeros going all the way across all the way to the thousandths place it 90 hundredths 90 what hundredths she said if it s 3 places it s 90 thousandths if it s 3 places it s what
hundredths 3 places 12390 thousandths thousandths thousandths good if it s 2 places then it would be what hundredths hundredths duh so this is the 2nd one so remember when you see 3 places before the decimal point it s thousandths 2 places it s hundredths please turn around
tenths can somebody tell me what the 3rd number is r 909 thousandths good 909 thousandths that s the 3rd number j 999 thousandths good 999 thousandths excellent all right any questions on that
no raise your hand if you need another example no yes of all different numbers of all different numbers you that was actually on the homework last night an example of all the different numbers
i can do an example of all different numbers
right say if i said here this is an example of all numbers
groups one and 2 please just come and join quietly the group so right now we re putting these numbers in order from least to greatest board all right on paper though on a piece of paper what have a seat you can just sit right there for now
just take out a piece of paper you what
okay was outstanding awesome thank you okay boys and girls so i just got a good report from one and 2 job so if we continue this until the end of class 2 times everybody s pin will go up
till recess how much and we ll talk about that after no kidding so we re putting these in order from least to greatest 0 wait so i m very proud of group one 2 the whole class 3 and 4 wait so again we re going to raise our hand
out good yeah all right you asked for this example here least yeah the least number is 0.97 what is it
0.97 okay so let s look at so let s start from the left to the right so we have a 0 here and a 0 here so we know we re working with these 2 numbers but we have a 5 here and a 9 here you yes i so we have a 505052 thousandths good
become one hundredths 900 thousandths thousandths good and the 3rd number shh the 3rd number is which one
600 thousandths i mean 11600 thousandths one and 600 thousandths and the last number how do we read the last number
okay one minute okay yeah
morning okay so here is your journal and it s mean median mode and range of the following set of data and then just add and subtract some of those are decimals and i m going to go ahead and put an asterisk meaning a little star next to the ones that do have decimals in them i know that you did one of these a couple of weeks ago that was very similar
so it s not the same exact one but that one that one that one and that one have decimals in them this one happens to be 1900 not one and 900000 okay them and once you ve finished all of those just go ahead and raise your hand and i ll be glad to take a look at it
and i m going to do it at the same time make sure you have the correct answers
that so remembering that have a seat excuse me
you re close and i could be wrong but let s just check it and make sure and it may be let me see what you got when you added it together cause we re getting different things okay you may be right
just let me check my work
okay let me make sure right range range do 1st cause it should be pretty easy close you and both are very very close
and if you take if took it out one more digit to the hundredths place i think she would have gotten it exactly correct
go okay and so if you kept going though if you kept going do you see that when you added on zeros you d keep going to a decimal place okay so that s where went and she just only went to the tenths place but she has it correct for the tenths place
i just had mine a little bit are you talking about here here it s just because there s so many numbers to add up it s actually 348 in the end so why don t you correct that over here and then you ll get the correct answer you had 344 and if you added them all up correctly it would be 348
right good job and i m just going to correct you here just so that you don t have to keep i want you to do the process correctly and if you added these up and regrouped correctly it would be 348 correct okay you ve gotten that correct
it actually is you ve done all of this correct i think that you chose 8 instead of 9 and that s your difference see how you subtracted 63 but that would be 89 times 7 not 8 does that make sense
okay okay does 7 go in i know it doesn t go into 3 no does 7 go no that just means that you would go to the next digit over and ask yourself if 7 goes into 34 correct remember you have to hold that space if it doesn t go into the 1st number
good take a look at that in a minute you all are doing the same thing over here and you re getting it you ve gotten it correct to the tenths place and then that s okay you re very very close it let s take a look at it
all right raise your hand if you want me to look at it really quick before because i m really proud of all of you getting the process correct numbers you re almost almost exactly correct all right if you have not finished that let s just take a look and recall the steps on doing the different processes
remember mean what does mean also stand for job mean is the average and that means we re going to add them all up get our average by dividing we add them all up and we get a total which i saw a couple of you make little errors in your addition
so you need to be really really careful because if you came up with 344 when you added all these numbers up together or 318 your end product is going to be wrong not product but your end sum is going to be wrong what anybody tell me what when you add all those numbers up together you get 292 you get 292 when you add these all up
s i think you might have forgotten a number the biggest one of all perhaps okay well that s not correct so what did you get c where is it okay let s take a look cause a lot of you got that same thing
so what we re going to do is look at 0 sorry 348 and so we find the average of these numbers we totaled up the sum j what number are we going to divide by if we re going to find the average of these numbers
7 does 7 go into 34 and how many times 34 343 times 7 goes into what that 4 times 7 is and the tables are set up kind of weirdly this week because of little experiments we re doing but face up here so you can be watching
job so 34 -28 is going to give us 67 can t go into 6 so we need to bring down does 7 go into 68 and how many times a yes it goes 9 times it does go in 9 times 49 i have a lot of you at that point so that s impressive now
so 9 times 7 is going to give us 63 right and once we do our subtraction here what do we have to do in order to take it out to the decimal places c to take it out to the decimal places yeah if we want to keep going over here what do we have to do down here put zeros good okay so 7 goes into 50 how many times
times and we ve got 7 times 7 being 49 we ve got one left over okay and we re going to add our 0 again time so those of you that got to that place keep driving out one more place most of you had it correct good that s okay i did tell you to go the hundredths place and that is the 2nd digit
right there like the 4 is over there 8 so and you re subtracting it right but but subtract but you would have had you had to regroup from here take it away make this a 2 and then you regroup over here and this becomes a 14 -68 what you did incorrect was 9 times 7 is not 64
out let s go ahead and so the mean here we re going to go ahead and 49 71 do i have a volunteer to tell me to put these in order so that we can do the median okay go ahead and put them in order from least to greatest so that we can do the median and then you can do the median because the median is short for what median means median means middle middle okay
quiet and one of the keys here with this one is you re going to have to make sure that the numbers that are duplicated meaning the ones that could be your mode you duplicate them the right amount of times
if you only duplicate them twice and they need to be here let s go ahead and i ll i ll go ahead and erase that since we ve already done it and that way you ll have room to finish this we know that this is the mean and now you have room job so she s put them in order from least to greatest and now show us how you find the median
you cross out and this one you happen to get one keep going nope oops explain to what she did
she took one more you have to go in sort of a pattern right and she messed up the pattern and she did one on the right side one more time than it should have been correct so you did right is okay but would it be that 56 let s go ahead and fix it for a minute and we re going to go ahead and put these back
yeah okay so is pointing to the correct one but she knows that 56 56 and 56 you were sitting in s seat there okay so we went from one side the other one side the other one side and the other
have to back and forth back and forth and we are left with only one in the middle middle if we were left with 2 in the middle if this was not an odd set of data what would we have to do with those 2 numbers we re left with in the middle
add and then say we were left with add let s look at the set of data that looks very similar and say that we only oops that s a 56 like our set that we have right now 89 so say we have a similar set of data but only 2 eyes up here only 2 sets of 56
we took that median and we went from either side oops sorry that to find the median of that set of data what would i need to do you would add those 2 together and then you would divide it by 2 because we re trying to find eyes up here we re trying to find what here of those 2 numbers
the average we are and when we find the median and we re left with 2 numbers in the middle we do that by finding the average of the 2 numbers that are left time we had a nice even set of data actually it was an odd numbered set of data but it came out nice and evenly to the one that was left in the middle so then we that is what our median is
mode what does it mean mode means right so we have we ve already put our numbers in least to greatest but we could even do that just by looking at the original set we see that 34 is mentioned twice but 56 is mentioned 3 times which is the most okay range what is what is the range of a set of data
data how do you figure that out subtract the biggest from the smallest the largest from the smallest number and we have 89 and what s the smallest number good and simply put that would be 66 so we would be done let s go ahead and since in the interest of time if you have not started already i m going to ask you to do these 3 okay
done we ll do just those 3 and if you ve done them already you can raise your hand
start all right we have 34
place okay so let s regroup and you ll have a different answer when you re done okay okay take a look because can we okay okay go ahead and try the 1st one
one okay and that s where your decimal place is you can do the 2nd one and you did all of them
one teacher okay is 0 -77 we have to hold our place there
okay let s see what they come up with and we re going to you may have you re close not close but you ve done everything right except for one thing side girls if you aren t looking for something in particular sit down and you can raise your hand and i can bring it to you
that is that correct all right for the 1st one up here we have 34 and 3 hundredths do we have a thumbs up for that 34 and 3 hundredths the one major mistake people were doing was not putting a 0 here to hold our place and then having to regroup
so as long as we ve lined it up perfectly it would be 34 and 10 hundredths or 110th 10 hundredths once we add our 0 -7 tenths i mean 7 hundredths i can t speak so that 1st one we have a thumbs up for the 2nd one let me see if i can find where we ve done that
okay we have just can i leave this up here yeah that s fine we have just an answer of one and 208 thousandths let s set it up properly though it says we have 8 thousandths +one and 2 tenths
up if you did not line up the decimals perfectly you would have gotten some completely different number okay so as long as he lined it up perfectly that one would have been quite easy you just had to add in your imaginary zeros to hold the place if you wanted to but lining it up perfectly would have put you where you needed to be
and the last one this was simple subtraction with whole numbers and again you would just line that up with the place value in the right place which is and do we have a thumbs up for that or do we need to fix that it we do huh what do you think do we have thumbs up or thumbs down thumbs down okay what do you think what do we need to do
change the group okay let s go ahead and look at how she could have regrouped which would have been 10 -6 is not 6 okay so we have we needed to regroup over here which is this would have become an 8 regroup 10 -6 is 4 okay good
is 0 okay and one minus okay do we have a thumbs up now for 1024 job all right we re going to skip over these last 2 and i m going to go forward yes
can yes which the one where it s one.20 plus never mind okay good all right let s just move forward because we have a lot of things to do today
and i m going to have you guys get in groups real briefly but we re on top because we haven t done volume in a couple of weeks and i noticed in a couple of the assessments we ve had lately that you all were doing most of them correctly but you weren t very confident about it when i asked you to write down the things that you were struggling with a little bit you happened to write down volume where but you were most of the time getting it correct
i think what you re going to see next year and this is what we re going to start talking about today is when you talk about volume next year it won t just be for rectangular prisms meaning square prisms cubes okay that s what those are square prisms or cubes
here what s going to be the case if i told you that this was a square prism and i m missing a side and i told you that the height of the square prism was 8 inches what would have to be the case with all the other measurements for that prism
here again i m sorry the way that it s set up today but that s just double it it put 2 squares okay 2 squares in one c i think so you think all the sides have to be because it is a square yes okay
but when we re finding volume what measurements especially of a rectangular prism are we worried about yes width okay width is one of them you re correct height okay and length okay and what we traditionally have learned it as was length times width times height which is length times width times height
now with this particular square prism where i put 8 everywhere and eyes up here please okay and please don t touch your neighbor s face okay when we put 8s all over here we mean because every side is 8 inches
so 2 things that we re going to have to keep in mind here does it really matter for a rectangular or square prism if i do weight if i do width or length 1st or height or width 1st or length or height last no okay well in this instance with a square let s go ahead and see what it is
width going to do width 1st cause she said width what s my width the size okay so what s my measurement the measurement is 88 inches okay c 8 right and what s my length let me see if i can get that back up
okay and so again what s my length or my width the height rather okay all right so we ve got 8 times 8 times 8 does it matter which one i do 1st no okay so we kind of established because they re all the same measurement it doesn t matter what we do 1st 64 64 and then we can go ahead and do the math for the last measurement cause we need all 3 and
32 okay 32 okay and 8 times 6 is what inches multiple students squared squared no s cubic inches because we are using 3 measurements
measurements it s going to be 512 inches cubic okay top okay now we re going to kind of experiment and i m going to use really small numbers 2 times to see if it matters prism we ll call this 6 and we ll call this 3 and we ll call this 2
okay does it matter whether i do width height or length 1st when i m doing rectangular prisms no what do you think
if they re different if they re different numbers it s you think let s do it twice let s do it as they re saying which is length is 6 times width is 2 times 3 is height 38 12 times 3 34
36 let s do it the other way the 1st way that it was told to me by let s do width times height which is 3 times length which is which is 6 sorry is 6 times 6 is okay does it appear that it really matters what order we do
okay so this is really for rectangular and square prisms we like this to be the nice little formula that we ve learned to use weeks and weeks ago when we were doing all our manipulatives and we were using the snap cubes and whatnot but for these in particular it does not matter what order we do what we re going to do today and i d like to get across from you guys are okay
get across from and get across from today we are not going to talk about formula yet because next year you re going to learn about the formula of different different 3 dimensional figures okay
what we talk about when we mean 3 dimensional figures can you think of other figures that we might be talking about that we might need to find the volume of rectangles if i pick up something and i need to know the volume of it is it always going to be perfect day if i need to know what i can fit in here is that impossible because it s not a perfect square
no no but there s going to be different formulas you re going to learn about today however though you re just going to explore irregular figures which means between the 2 of you between and actually you guys can do it with each other i don t mind of the girls want to do it and boys want to do it but just make sure you have something up between you that you can t really see while you re working
okay you and and all i m going to ask you to do is build some figures and i m going to give you some copy paper you can build a rectangular prism
now if you decide to build a square prism i want your eyes up here if you decide to build a square prism or a rectangular prism you can use you can go a little further and you can use a ruler to find the volume of it okay so that s your choice if later on you build one that s regular that you can find the volume of
right now though you re going to be building something that might be irregular
yesterday all right you all are going to have to i m going to get some more from teacher and you ll be using some toothpicks not a lot because it looks like i m running out yesterday so some toothpicks okay and you re going to make it and i ll find you some more so if you aren t able to start it s okay i ll get them for you
appropriate okay and you re going to get a handful of these but you are going to put your barrier up across from your person while you re building okay and if you d like this put on a paper towel so you can eat them later you don t want to be touching the desk
table but think about the irregular shape that you want to build okay and what you re going to do is do it while the person is not looking and then you re going to draw it for that person and they need to re create it
okay so okay see if i can find some more them okay i have plenty can we work together on this no
guys you all need to listen to the instructions okay cause it s a little bit different you do not need to use all the toothpicks i m going to collect whatever you don t use he took all of them i have 1000s okay
they re also going to act as the vertices if you come and you decide to make something triangular okay so they re going to act twofold that way and once you ve made your figure you re going to draw it for the person across from you okay you re going to put it in a paper bag which i m going to give to you and you re going to swap and see if that person can build it from your drawing
and you need to draw write on there how many vertices how many faces you know faces are the sides vertices are the where the 2 sides come together at an angle and i ll get it for you and how many edges on your blank sheet of paper and i ll be bringing that to you too
okay so in just a do you guys need a you need a folder to block one okay good all right all right let me know if you need more toothpicks let me know if you need more marshmallows 1st put it together and then draw a picture of it so can re create it
doing and i ll be bringing a half sheet of paper around to you so you can draw it for the person across from you
okay i ll bring it to you you are definitely going to be able to eat them when you re done but you probably don t want to be putting your hands all over them or the other person putting their hands all over them if you want to eat them
i have more for you if you re kind of disgusted by that so i ll give you some more when you re done yay okay but draw the picture put the picture don t put the picture inside your paper bag okay 1st create it and put this up between you so you don t see what the other person is making okay like that so she can t see you you can t see i m drawing the picture both of you are doing it
you re going to make something with you need more marshmallows all right if you need more folders you can have them you don t need a paper thank you
you re welcome you need more marshmallows okay okay if you need more folders cause you don t want to see that s fine
all right all right so you and you are building something
both of you are going to build something with your toothpicks and with your marshmallows okay and i m going to go ahead and give you your paper bags in just a minute yes doing okay and then once you ve made it it doesn t have to be totally regular like i said
once you ve made it draw it for the person across from you put it inside of your paper bag and then they re going to try to re create it no you can make anything you want but don t let him see what you re making that s because this thing needs to be up between you 2 well you guys decide that
all no i said if you re going to eat them you have to eat the ones i m giving you cause i m and guys draw the marshmallows too
you yep okay who needs more toothpicks you need more toothpicks let me know
good all right and you ll want to put now build the figure
okay no but you can do something bigger than that if you don t want it to be so simple for them to be able to re create
because you re going to draw it for the person so they can make it and what i mean by drawing it you re going to have to draw the whole thing
okay i saw this difficult you re not going to see both ends okay it looks different than that if you actually draw it so make sure you draw it look exactly like what you have in front of you
but these little circles should be where the marsh for instance if you re making it super long and the marshmallows connect 2 different toothpicks here then that s you need to put marshmallows there too see you need more toothpicks okay i don t have any what don t you have any of
okay you re not going to have a big figure if you okay you need more marshmallows that s beautiful but you re showing it to her
point you can eat it but wait until you re done making something okay i ll get them for you looks good
bag okay you re welcome can i do another one on top
sure yeah you have something we need more toothpicks and more marshmallows i need more toothpicks well when you need them ask me for them okay put that away okay
all marshmallow okay all right now put it inside the paper bag around teacher how can i make it you just have to lay it on its side if you need to
later yep you sure are
i d like to see the person across from you re create it after you draw it i need some more toothpicks okay here you go i think i should have set this up as a station where you come get them yes if i had known you were going to be the only people in here i would have done that because i didn t want 25 people running around why are we putting it in here so that they can t see it while they re trying to make it
well that s the whole point of the folder
up no i really didn t teacher i need more toothpicks okay 0 my gosh
if you cannot fit it in the paper bag then go ahead and just draw it and keep the folder up so that the person still can t see it okay yes okay well you know what
finish up and if you are making more than one finish up the 1st one i m going to you about 4 minutes to draw it and then let the person across from you re create it can i write my name on here
right okay you need to be doing your drawing
looks good all right so you re going to need more toothpicks and more marshmallows to re create what your partner s done so i m going to put a few more of each at each table
i m coming we re done with making it so now you re going to re create it and you and have to share i m out of marshmallows after this cause some of you have eaten them
share okay you all are going to share now draw it for him and he s looking at it yep well no the person that you decided to work with
i told you he already saw mine yeah if you can t fit in in a bag just keep it there and draw it for her mine is so hard to re create yeah you used a lot of marshmallows no just leave it there so she can t see it and then give her the picture and see if she can draw it see if you can lean it up against there
that s okay happen yep go ahead and give her the piece of paper and she can start to re create it if it s too complicated we might not be able to do it cause we don t have enough marshmallows marshmallows you know what
there okay now you have to build hers or his whoever your partner is i m building well i didn t know who he was working with teacher do you have i need a toothpick okay
some of you won t be able to cause you ve used too many marshmallows but we ll get started and see if it looks like what s in the bag then put as i said before if you can t put it in the bag then put a barrier up so they can t see it and leave it that way
it it s hard it is hard
now okay i ll see if i have them but i may not have that many i don t understand his picture well that s what you re supposed to be that s the problem you have to really be clear on the faces and vertices that you re using 12345678910
need no you need 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 creating 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 need okay share toothpicks if you can and i ll bring them around if you need more
what get started and then you ll know how many you need
all right and if you need more marshmallows look for people at your table that might have more than you need all right the timer is going to go off in a minute and whatever you got you re going to show and see if you re anywhere near building what your partner made
if you took the marshmallow give it back please thank you and remember you re on camera so if you want to want to give it back to her we don t have to look at the camera if you can give it back to her then we won t have to look at the camera to see what really happened
i m not tall enough okay and we have 4 minutes teacher the thing is too small that s okay you can just use the bigger that s okay you can see the bottom of it
know that s just a little hint though for them to get started
okay now freeze freeze he s eating my marshmallows i want your eyes up here
done okay i know that you re not completely done here let s go now what did you notice those of you that were actually able to start shh start re creating the other person s what do you notice when you re creating the other person s figure
it s hard what it is hard but what made it easier as you were able to start doing that how there s a camera right there
here you guys i know that this is this is almost the end of the year busy week but i need your eyes just for a few minutes d thank you okay so the drawing made it easier why s cause when you take good visualize i heard visualize twice
what were you seeing so we talked about the different parts of your drawing that you were visualizing so you re visualizing how many what sides okay so sides meaning vertices i mean faces i mean what we ve got 3 different elements to our figure as if you re talking about you re talking about the flat sides
or created by the toothpicks toothpicks okay so if you re talking about the toothpicks and i m going to show a really simple one right now cause s would be a little easier than say s but if he s talking about the sides represented by the toothpicks what are those also known as faces edges okay good good good good
so those would be the edges and if you were given a visual even if it was s which i m not going to touch well actually i m going to show yeah i am s because i think it s pretty sturdy but s and s are both pretty cool but it s very sturdy cause it s joined together at lots of vertices
now this would be hard to re create if i only gave you 5 minutes like i did here but if i had an exact representation with all the edges all of where the edges meet which are called the what where the edges meet together in the corners what are those also known as vertices vertices one is a vertex i need for you boys to be off
i know you re trying to continue doing what i asked you to do but your voices need to be off now vertices one would be a vertex okay and then the other thing that you can really visualize here is how many what faces flat sides would be the faces
okay when you when you determine the volume of a figure that is 3 dimensional like this this is the information you re going to have to have
just like just like when we determined the volume of those big cubes we made with paper rolled up paper a little while ago the new figures the 3 dimensional ones that are not regular are still going to include all of these elements and you re going to have to figure out how many of each and how long each one is
it might be inches okay i know that this is a little bit more interactive than what we ve been doing the last 2 weeks but it s we re not hiding anymore okay cause we re out of time to re create it so i need your eyes up here and don t worry about that okay
stop okay thank you w face forward okay i have an extra one if you need it i ll give it to you but just for the time being don t stress it
it you re going to need to share this sheet with you for the 3rd time go to your seat then take your stuff get a board and sit on the carpet
you re not sitting over there it s s seat take your sheet take a board sit on the carpet or sit at your desk
okay you re going to need your math notebook for this lesson it okay i ll put it in front of me thank you good job all right so in case you forgot what i said this morning today division tomorrow division next week
it we re going to not going to basically this is going to look easy for us by this time next week right now i look at this and this is a tough problem but by next week we ll know the strategies to solve it everybody everybody on the desk should have a strip of paper right yeah direction so you don t have that strip so take yours off and put it on the board okay
strip we think with our brains we think with our brains obviously but you know what sometimes believe it or not our fingers can help us about because sometimes in just words we write with our fingers right
pencil right so we re going to try to do something we re going to do something a little similar something all right this right here
no yes yes it doesn t say the division yes part you guys and you actually should be able to recognize this when i read it out loud this is what you guys need to memorize and say to yourself when you solve a division problem
okay 1st of all this number outside is a divisor all right it s important to know that that s a divisor the number inside is a dividend dividend is on the inside divisor on the outside everybody or you re sharing should have fact families for certain number
i didn t write them all because there s there s 12 12 the 15s wow i know my 12 s i kind of know my 15s i don t know my 90s i definitely don t know my 75s so whenever you see a division problem like this 1st thing you should do is fact family write it yourself
family trust me do the work now so you can coast later go look what i do with my finger okay 12 so i m going to write 12 right here 12 all right look what i do with my finger okay
s because it s a lower number it s what because it s a lower number which is a lower number ahead just start copying on paper or in the notebook in your notebook so 1st thing i did didn t take a lot of math
12 doesn t go into one one so put a 0 right above the one don t put a 0 about the 3 put it above the one because we re just dealing with the one
okay now 12 goes into 10 times 131 time one time another way to do it is using this 12 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 13
lightly write it really lightly times one 12 times one you re correct if you look at your fact family 12 times one is close to 13 12 12
simple you can cross this out too 13 okay we re done with that now and this opportunity you drop the 15
so i m going to write 15 here as my new dividend using my finger i want you guys to use your finger too okay me i ll wait a 2nd i m going a little too fast wait let everybody copy yeah let everybody copy
2nd thank you
one and you could look at your fact families you don t need to memorize it there what s one times 12 12 you are going to drop that 0 okay we already got the 15
2 all right when you re done copying pencil s down again 30 over here do you see what i did 0 that s right because 15 -2 is 3
okay when you re done you re pencils are going to be down just so i know i don t got my own paper all right you need to share with somebody i didn t have enough share with this time all right okay get your pinkie again or that s how you do all right you re going to tap on that sheet again
by what number is equal to what number is equal to close to close to but not past but not past 30 3 12 times 3 is 36 past way past 30 right so what s 2 times 12
240 what if this was 3rd grade we would just say remainder 6 and we would be done grade okay i can make this a little clearer no i said not that where s
i don t know all right now what should i do now now derrick what should i do next down dropping down dropping what i want you guys to do is go the hundredths spot
drop and drop another now i m going to put a 60 here okay 2nd i want you to copy this down and then you can work on your own sure i ll wait for you guys to have your pencils down
ready all right with your fingers i saw and doing it let me see the rest of you guys put your fingers on the strip 12 multiplied by 12 multiplied by what number is what number is equal to close to but not past 60 beautiful and what s 5 times 12
is 0 you know we add 0 and a decimal i m actually done 0 and we know 12 goes into 00 times fine that s your answer make your answer a little bigger no this is the same 0 i just wanted to stop at the hundredths spot just to get us in the habit
d you can write as long as you erase it because i m just doing it to help you guys with it down you could write it just erase it
fine cross out what you look you can cross out this and do another one all so that example 2 990 divided by 15
michael for this problem what value is the divisor here all right here we go
1st part shouldn t be that tough do you have it copied down times one time 6 times times 0 times all right again this really isn t a high calculating math
9 so 0 i thought you were saying how many it goes into 99 now so let s do this out loud okay thank you
you multiply 15 multiplied by 15 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 99 what number is equal to close to but no past 99
90 all right thumbs up if you like having that fact family done already before you re spent time doing it but you re not stressed out about it 9 and i just drop a 0 and 90
and you know what i mean let s do it why not 15 multiplied by what number multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 90 is equal to close to but not past 90
it that will be 66 and what s 6 times 15 90 and you know what now that i add a 0 there s no more dividends to drop 0 yeah there s no more dividends to drop 66 okay
raise your hand if you thought you d be dividing by 75 and 5th grade good all right let s copy down example 3 all right and when you re done just put your pencil down
right 1010 wouldn t be on that far it s just a factors of 75 the multiples of 75 up to the 10s
okay 75 goes into one how many times that what s that it is 0
times why d you say 0 though 0 because it s a lower number okay now 75 goes into 10 100 times 0 will because 75s bigger yeah 75s a lot bigger than 10
all right so you put a 0 above that all right huh 101 so that d be wait it s not
what s my divisor for example 3 correct 75 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 101 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 101
okay so what s one times 75 here and i ll erase this so it s easier regrouping okay because there s more on the floor in both cases regroup because a 10 then this needs to borrow from that
11 11 -5 is 62 310 divided by 90 well 1st of all you re only going up the hundredths
.40 i m still working on theirs you can check you can use a calculator to check your work if you need to class all right so 75 can t go into 260 and cross that out
260 thank you 75 are you guys with me 75 multiplied by what number is equal to multiplied by what number is equal to thank you will 3 what s 3 times 75 will 3 times 75 is 225
225 okay do some subtraction you re going to have to regroup again am i done not i wanted to answer on okay if you re right i can t check it right now
because hundredths hundredths okay so what do i do shantiz to keep going s andrea going so i can solve this up to the hundredths wow
what do i do to keep going i don t have any more dividends what do i do 0 dot and drop dot and drop
shantiz you add a decimal and you drop a 0 if you want to keep going that s what i m doing what number is equal to thank you will close to but not past 350 350 it will be 4 is it 44 yeah yeah will what s 4 times 75
300 very good if you do subtraction you get 50 i m on my tenths spot i want to be in my hundredths so what do i have to do do i want to keep going just so i can solve drop a 0 drop a 0 yeah
here you put 500 500 yeah so can you help me with this i know you got to put a 01st 75 multiplied by what number is 75 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 500
500 will and that will be 6 right is it 6 okay what s 6 times 75 145 4500 is 4500 no 450
450 you re welcome so if you look here 500 so this that s why i say just go up to the hundredths so that s the answer 13.46 that s your answer
for the next no it s 13 next 15 minutes work on these right here work i m going to be walking around this is math
minutes and then we do some more math else science no no no d careful with that i like how the ladies are working at the table
can okay where s your fact family sheet no no the sheet with the facts i need that okay that s why i had you guys i don t have enough you guys need to share 90 okay this is where you re going to be looking all right so 1st thing is you look at 90 goes into 3 30 yeah it goes in so you put 0 right on top of it
times which number s bigger 90 or 31 90 yeah so it ll be 00 now how many times does 90 go into 310 okay so the divisor is 90 and this is 310 okay so 90 multiplied by what number 90 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 310
here yeah i agree i think that s pretty close because that s past it so you can put a 3 right on top 0 and then 3 times 90 huh good it s right there 270 you just put it right under the 310
that okay okay so 1st is 90 into 3 which is 0 31 so how did you plug it in
i said 90 this and then i tried no you would do 311st so 310 this would be the answer though 310 divided by 90 okay
3.44 you just go up to the hundredths you don t you go up to the hundredths 2 spaces after the decimal so that s as far as you go this you have your fact families for 90s right here want so 90 goes into 31 how many times
which number s bigger which number s bigger the 90 or the 31 310 so 90 multiplied by what number is equal to close to but not past 310 look here look here please whisper it in my ear are you sure
you i don t know maybe is it no number 90 times 300 yeah that s the right answer 3 it s 3 90 multiplied by 3 is close to 310 what it s right there you don t even have to think
there i ll be with you in a moment 3 times 90 is 270 subtraction you said 3 times 90 same one +2 is the same as 2 +one relationship multiplication and addition have a relationship where it doesn t matter what order you say it in it s the same sum
h yeah do you have will i heard you calling my name 310 yeah would be 3 yeah so what didn t you get about it well i got it you put a 3 right here and a 3
90 3 times 90 that would be 270
yeah you put 270 right under the 310
yes not right now
for a moment yeah okay 0 no what you do is so you ended up sorry okay it doesn t go into 160
drop it s 1600 actually no wait yeah so look at you might need a calculator to figure it out to 1600 i m only going up to 10 right here you math is wrong that s why i m having a problem with this okay
2 it s 11 be 0 that s why that don t go right yeah mister h
times yeah 4 times yeah no problem i got it it so i ll just give it to her on friday or thursday i ll do it tomorrow that s fine
you you don t get not telling me where you are 0 i didn t see where you was i was writing this down i didn t yes
0 we re done with math that s why
all right did you use a calculator to solve this because this isn t right 40 yeah that s 40 okay clap 3 times if you hear me
me snap 6 times if you can hear me question raise your hand if you can tell me what we were just doing in math
doing today in math we was doing division by 2 digits wow okay i probably will okay now whatever and you re different
and way okay teacher c s table we re going to have
w and head over there and you 3 can go on laptop stay on the rug area and do then you have that table and you have right all right
okay diagrams now we re going a different way to record data and that s with line graphs
okay so i m going to give you a post it now and i want you to write down one thing that you remember about line graphs
you something you remember about line graphs that s okay if you can t think of anything about line graphs maybe anything about graphs that you remember help anything about graphs what do graphs do
share they are fraction graphs sometimes they can show fractions can what else a line graph can be like if you see which animal is the fastest so it could record their speed over a certain amount of time
good a graph could be like how many people like opera and how many people like plays okay line graphs wouldn t be used for that kind of graph
a bar graph would be used for that because that s telling you a certain amount of objects that you re counting when we re doing line graphs we want to think about things that happen over time like maybe how fast your heart beats the 1st minute after you job the 2nd minute changing over time but good
we could also do line graphs with weather the temperature how it changes it more or less yeah you can determine more or less of something on a graph good excellent could you please open up your book to page your page is i think 123
now we re going to look at the graphs on page 123 and there s 2 different types of data we can collect data that involves counting like just told us like she s going to count how many people like oranges how many people like apples people then there s continuous data and that involves measuring over a period of time like maybe how high you ve grown over a year cause that s over a period of time and how much you ve grown
okay so in your notebook let s write down the difference between the 2 discreet data and continuous data in your notebook we re going to look at your notebook i m going to write it down for you
so we have discreet data involves counting
and they are not related the data is not related to each other like apples and oranges they wouldn t be related to each other yeah not related to each other let s put that in parentheses not related to each other
123 we have afternoon temperatures and we have the heights of 5 trees now looking at those 2 tables which one do you think shows discreet data think okay
if you agree with put your thumbs in the air if you think it s the height of the trees right because if you look at the other one that one has continuous data because what are they doing there time and they re showing us what on there the temperatures how they changed over time sometimes it doesn t stay the same all day long does it
good now can you think of another example and gave us one of when we would collect discreet data she said we could ask the classmates who like apples and who like oranges do go ahead and discuss with your partner people who likes strawberry ice cream and who likes chocolate okay good can you think of one
who like white versus pink okay good yes
so it s usually based on somebody s choice or their selection and how much they have
idea if you have a blue pencil and you want to know what pencil classmate and they to demonstrate maybe mechanical regular or a sparkly one
good i think obama and the other one we choose what we like yeah we choose what we like yeah good yeah that would be when you used a bar graph the discreet data good can you think of another example it could be grapes or raisins okay
okay yeah we just did a big we put that on a bar graph too didn t we yeah you just said you like both you what s another example we could do for discreet data
me yeah colors good n definitely food choices yeah too now can you think of any examples when we could collect continuous data that s a little harder to think about changes over time
do you mean like the future not necessarily the future but when would you collect data on something like when you plant a seed excellent yes so the height of the plant after a certain period of time j no
that would be choosing between the 2 that s when you use your bar graph data continuous data is something that continuously changes over time s i got another one when we we so the height and how you grow over a period of time
good well that would be a choice night the sun the sun and moon the goes down okay maybe how dark it is yes we could do that or maybe you could measure the temperature of what it s like in the day and the night
okay that would be again data that you would collect discreet data right do you see what i mean another example
if you have different types of cheese like 3 different types of cheese which one will rot 1st i guess if you measured the amount of mold on each piece of cheese and how it changed over time yeah that would work
about it s okay if you can t think of 12 yeah so you re counting or you re changing something over time and that s what would you collect the data on
more you buy 3 books and then the other day you buy more and then more and then more so how many books you buy over a period of time and how much you end up accumulating good how many times people call you a day and how many times you would knock on the door there and that definitely changes over like a period of an hour
is this discreet data which one is better raisin bread or regular bread yes that s discreet good go ahead and turn your page to 124 we are going to do questions 5 through 9 together but i m going to let you do independently 1st and then we ll discuss each question
so right now which graph shows discreet data one you can put the bar graph or the line graph b or l think which one is discreet the bar one or the line one
graph it s right on the top there are you looking for the word graph sweetie 0 it s okay up which one thinks it s a bar graph
one is it this one trees the tree one i think it s the line you think it s the line remember discreet we re counting and it tells us a specific amount there it tells us the name of 5 trees and the heights of them so that one is telling us the exact height of the tree
it s not telling us how the height of the tree changes trying to trick you a little bit there data so which one would show the continuous data yeah the one with time because it shows you how the afternoon temperatures are changing over the afternoon so that s the difference between the 2
now suppose the height of a 6th tree was added to the bar graph could you predict what the height of the tree would be if i added another tree to the bar graph could we predict without knowing anything about the tree of the height of the tree no so discreet data it doesn t have any relationship to the rest of the data in there does it
if i put a maple tree in there it has nothing to do with the tree it so discreet data stands by itself so let s look at it the other way suppose at 6 0 pm look at your afternoon temperatures graph suppose that at 6 0 pm the temperature was added to a line graph
would it be difficult to predict what the temperature might be or is it a little easier to do that what do you think what i think it might be hard to predict you think it would be harder to predict that what do you notice about the graph what happens between one 0 and 2 0
up and 3 0 and 4 0 it stays the same same and then 4 0 to 5 0 it starts to go down down down so you think you could give kind of a good estimate of what it could be yeah so do you see the difference between continuous and discreet data continuous i can kind of predict sometimes and discreet has nothing to do with the rest of the graph so i can t predict it
totally different yeah what s the answer for number for number what 7 what do you think yes 7 is the bar graph honey so the tree adding that would not be easy but number 8 is the temperature
easy 0 so number 7 is yeah i think we kind of skipped over that real quick okay now in your notebook i want you to write down a question that you could ask somebody about either one of those graphs think of a real hard question for somebody to have to answer between those graphs write you can compare heights
you could predict there s many ideas what do you mean on the graph yeah like on the what goes over 100 you need to come up with a question that you would like pretend like you re making a test for somebody and using these graphs what question could you ask them
are we almost ready to switch guys or no one more minute okay isn t this a line graph yes that s a line graph are we supposed to make our own it you re to use these graphs and come up with a question about these graphs
for example what s the difference between the blue wood tree and the sparkle berry tree numbers compare them compare them and do what operation if you re comparing 2 numbers what are you going to do
difference one of them is 20 and one of them is 25 numbers am i going to add them or subtract them subtract subtract them because i want to find the difference
does anybody have a question they came up with if i added 6 0 pm 7 0 pm 8 0 pm would it go up or down so that s a prediction one do you think the temperature would go up or down if she added those
look between 4 0 and 5 0 it started to trend downward okay does anybody else have a different one yeah can you change these containers can you interchange them i wonder if you could come up with an idea for that that would be hard to come up with
good please go to your next group desk please listen to where you re going next when you come back to see me please bring your math volume one book and your math notebook i need to see and
and teacher c will see and and teacher a will see and
let s have you sit right here so your back is facing okay sit right in this chair here so your back is facing i think we may i think i would have wrote you down if you weren t you re fine can you go get your math book and your notebook for me volume one
did you bring your math book and your math notebook do you have your math books
point you don t have to worry about it right now sweetie good job don t fall the math book yeah volume one how do you spell grapes
g r a p e s we have been discussing tree diagrams and we are going to be looking at line graphs today what do you know about line graphs i want you to discuss with your partners
now on your post it note i want you to write down an idea you have about graphs any idea that you just discussed that you think is important about any type of graph for why do we have to read them what could it show on a graph
h as soon as you re finished you can share it i put go ahead what do you know about graphs
all just tell me what you re thinking you can on the graph how something weighs it has numbers and it also can tell how much of something so it s kind of a way to illustrate data that we collect yeah good
numbers what about you all i m not sure you re not sure what graphs do and why we have to learn about them have you ever used graphs before
s i put to read important so because they give you a graph you re able to get information from it j it could show changes over time
good that s actually what a line graph does you re not sure i like your 1st thought we ll stick with your 1st thought and if you think of the other one let me know okay s graphs compare 2 or more things that see which is greater good
graphs do do that sometimes don t they what s your idea most graphs are a graph that compares something to another from least to greatest okay you usually can get some sort of number if you re comparing 2 things you can get an idea of how much one or the other is
good could you please open up your book to page 123 right it s kind of a combination of both isn t it
we re going to talk about different types of data we collect and depending on the type of data we collect determines what type of graph we make
okay determines what type of graph because we don t always use the same graph for all the data we collect there s a difference now if we did discreet data that involves counting something like and i were talking about if you had a choice who likes grape or who likes apples everybody would raise their hand and i would count who likes what right and then i would do a bar graph because that would show discreet data
but what if i decided i m going to measure how much you grow from the beginning of the year to the end of the year your height it the height of how much you grew from the beginning of the year till the end of the year that s going to change isn t it it changes over a period of time and that s when we use a line graph when we change something over a period of time
so let s write down in our notes the difference between the 2 types of data counting they re not related to each other i can t look at who likes apple and determine how many kids will like grapes then other if we were doing pizza and chicken who likes pizza who likes chicken if i know how many people like chicken is that going to help me determine who likes pizza no
they re separate ideas just because you like chicken that doesn t mean you re going to like or not like pizza it s a different idea i can t predict how many people are going to raise their hand for pizza too can i
no but if i was growing something and say it was 2 inches the 1st week and then after 2 weeks it grew another 2 inches then after the 6th week it grew another 2 inches probably the 8th week it s going to grow another 2 inches 2 inches
that s something i can predict i might be off a little bit but at least it s going upward unless i didn t water it and it died right
but could they like both yeah yeah so i can t necessarily know for sure because the idea is not related i m going to give you a better example when we talk about it in the book then continuous data that is measuring over time
down it s a little chilly over here i just turned the air on because i got warm but now i m getting cold i ll turn it down i m going to put this right here in case you didn t get it
if i turn it down we ll be ice cubes off it does say data s okay
notes graphs over there yeah graph okay
now if you re finished with your notes i want you to take a look at i collect it from your test scores you re going to look on page 123 and there s 2 charts there that are displaying data notes read your titles read what it s telling you how it goes up and down
so looking at those graphs which one do you think is showing discreet data of do you think it s the afternoon temperatures or do you think it s the height of the trees
sure what i m asking you is which one is just counting something is which one is i m measuring something over a period of time i m looking for the one that i m counting and then i m going to graph it which one could i do that with yeah the trees
height i didn t tell you i m measuring it that i m going to measure it in may okay so which one would be continuous data then which chart would be continuous you can say it the temperature because i m showing the temperature over a period of time
one 0 i took my temperature and it was 76 degrees but then at 2 0 it s 78 degrees so it s getting a little warmer yet at 4 0 it stays the same 81 and then at 5 0 it starts to go down to 80 on it might get colder and keep going down good now can you think of any other time that you could make a graph with discreet data
can you think of an example of when you could have data that would be discreet go ahead and discuss with your neighbors you 2 you 2 you 3 and i ll discuss with you 2
what could you ask your classmates about what type of food do you like ice cream or do you like
well do you want to keep desserts together ice cream and think of another dessert brownies brownies good how about another example what could you ask your classmates and collect data on favorite favorite games good let s share some ideas
on please turn around on food okay any types of food e games like video games or outside games favorite video game favorite outside game did you think of another one because they kind of took your idea book
good favorite book ice cream favorite types of ice cream them okay go ahead can you think of something else or did they take all your ideas tv favorite tv show tv or type of tv
w favorite thing to do on your leisure time okay good excellent now this is a little harder can you think of examples of when you would collect continuous data the temperature yep changing over time the temperature is one
can you think of other examples though and we ll share these all out because they re a little harder measurement of plants the movement movement of the clouds depending on where they were how far they moved in a certain time when the sun sets how long it takes the sun to set yeah how long does it take the world to rotate the moon
how long it takes the moon to go around the revolve around the okay good 124 now what they ve taken is that data that they in the chart and they ve made graphs for it so in your notebook we re going to 5 through 9 together
count who thinks the bar graph graph just put b or l in your notebook what s the bar graph it has the bars on it bars so which one is discreet
good so which one would show continuous data line graph line graph and that s where they connect the lines because it relates to each other 1st at one 0 and then at 2 0 i m still the temperature but i m changing over time
exactly good so i want you to look at the tree graph again and if i was to add a maple tree to that would i be able to look at my previous data and determine the height of my maple tree yes no wait what was it they i have a totally different type of tree i m sticking in there
i can t look at the blue wood tree grew 20 feet so my maple tree should grow 20 feet no i can t do that other if you have the same tree right then maybe you could do some comparison now i want you to look at the line graph now
book can you look the line graph now could i predict what the temperature could be at 6 0 pm about about because what is happening to the temperature
up down it s going down it goes up stays the same and then starts to go down so at 6 0 it probably is going to go downward
78 but i ll be able to determine all right good it s not that cold at night true we re almost ready to switch okay is that okay
no you don t have to do it it i went over it
going you guys get to go to you re going to go see teacher c computers
you can t come over settle down please i m not going to speak over you and you re going to see teacher c
and the rest of you go to hi guys
there okay
ready we ve been talking about tree diagrams and now we re going to shift gears into thinking about line graphs now what i want you to do is to write down anything you know about graphs it doesn t have to just be lines just one idea
me that s awesome that you know so many ideas but one idea about line graphs graphs i shouldn t hear any talking on the computers you
thank you
one what did you draw lines or bars okay read it out loud graphs represent how much or how many thank you teacher a idea i put there are many types of graphs pie graphs lines graphs bar graphs good there is many types
you can just tell me what you re thinking you don t have to write it graphs measure the different facts measure your data or measure what you re looking at good at 1st i wrote a pie graph makes me hungry but i knew you wouldn t take that i guess that s a thought that came in your head though now can you please open up to 123
we re going to talk about depending on what kind of data of we collect depends on what kind of graph we make cause we re not going to make the same type of graph for all the data we collect for example if i ask the class what their favorite color is i m counting and it s discreet data
answer what if i said we re going to measure the temperature this afternoon because we re supposed to get a cold front change i don t know off the top of my head what that s going to be at 2 0 if it s 11 0 now yes question what if the change their mind at say 3 0
accurate cool what i need you to write down in your notes is the difference between the 2 types of data
counting i m counting something and then i m measuring it and then i m putting it in a bar graph continuous data i m measuring the changes over time maybe how tall got from the beginning of the year till the end of the year maybe how tall my plant got from march till june
are you okay
okay continuous continuous well counting is up here counting let s keep comments like that to ourselves please what do you need to say to
you we don t want to hurt anybody s feelings what does that mean what do you mean how do you describe when you do something you know you use your brain and you re able to think of it without thinking about it
like if i would have just slide myself across the table i wouldn t be using my right because she knows what s going to happen if you do that teacher m is going to get angry with you yeah yes know some of the names of those trees that they have in there like a nanny berry i do not know what that is either i ve heard of weeping willows yes i know what that one looks like
okay let s move on because only have about 5 more minutes guys so i want you to look at that data that s on the 2 charts that are in your book one of them is afternoon temperatures and one is heights of 5 trees between the 2 of them which one do you think is the discreet data trees if you think it s the temperatures put on finger tree is 2
a i ve actually heard of tree discreet on this one discreet on the trees good data now could we think of another example of discreet data that we could collect and make a bar graph with example how many people actually write notes down okay note takers versus non note takers yes
how many people okay can you pick one pick a food who likes it i ll come back to you
classmates favorite games games you like yet what s your favorite thing that s in your lunchbox excellent one more thing it has to do with food how many people like chicken nuggets over burgers and how many people like burgers over chicken nuggets what s your favorite pie there you go now you re getting it
their thanksgiving dinner isn t that bad that s what i buy who likes lord of the rings or harry potter so you can compare movies okay now could we also think of examples of when we would do continuous data
time height height good do you want me to come back to you distance distance over a period of time
work i d say if you measure somebody s eyes like you could measure it when they re 10 and then when they re 15 you could measure if they get on a scale of one to 10 10 as being the best eyesight and one is the worst yeah you can measure eyesight over time definitely another one brainwaves brainwaves how they change over time yeah remember i forgot exactly when it was
okay a test that i had to do i had to go to the doctor s office and sleep there at night yes i remember that test they said that since they attached all that stuff to my head all the electrodes i think it s called
they said that they saw my brainwaves and apparently they said i had a dream and i bet they know that from how they move a miles miles you travel over a period of time good now go ahead and turn to the next page and they ve actually taken the data and turned it into our graphs
it discreet not line discreet is counting and i know exactly how much continuous is like when you re in a business in a company and they show how much money you got over the yeah that s a great example a great example had this graph and it showed his population is a good example
so he had to go to a toilet and s was like your line fell into the toilet okay so continuous would be the one with what temperatures though looking at those 2 graphs which one do you think it would be easy to predict what would be next for example if i put a maple tree in there would i be able to predict the height of my maple tree based on that information in that graph
it but you could kind of predict what it could be like at 6 0 pm difference continuous data you can kind of predict but discreet data you cannot it just gives you information about those options that you put down exactly
care make up a question that maybe you would have to answer on a test about one of those graphs like a question to do with like put on my old school test that you would put up there northbrook public school yes pretend you re a northbrook public school test writer and you re going to make a question paper i misunderstood what you said
a what is that what is what 0 so it would continue down to 0 but they took a part of the graph did they ask you that no would they no they won t ask you that but is that a question you could ask
yeah we make our own graph no use this graph here and you re going to come up with a question about this graph or come up with a question about that graph want is it okay to take a 2 steps yeah
they would give you 2 step graphs right okay you can ask something about the temperatures yeah
you could do the difference between them or the total amount do you want to share yours no yet what does the zigzag under the 74 mean it means that it s a part of the graph
good did you come up with a question it okay was close it up and hook it back up to the outlets please and head back to your seats
i m doing the height of 5 trees in feet what if you added the soap berry and sparkle berry would it equal any other tree if it equals more how much more i like that one yeah
that is awesome and that is exactly the type of question you d get different times okay
let s have my round table line up 1st by the door tape can you let her in honey let s have s group line up s group
and your green and make a little house and i want you to trace it on your grid paper okay
yes all right so i drew a model on my dry erase board right here 2nd to find the area for shape if it is a 4 sided shape such as a square or rectangle or parallelogram what do i do multiply what do i multiply
base times height the base times the height triangle how do i find the area of a triangle thing we will put a base times height but then there is a 2nd step and we divide by 2 if you look at the shape that you have drawn what are the 2 shapes that you have there
a triangle and a square a triangle and a square and i have labeled the dimensions looks like a little house
something i have noticed what we have been doing the past week you guys are sometimes struggling with finding the missing dimension when it does not label it directly today if i look at this shape does it tell me the base of the square yes what is the base of my square
8 technically it is a rectangle though because how do i know it is a rectangle rectangle do i know the base of the triangle no out yes can somebody tell me how to figure out the base of the triangle
j you use the 20 times 8 8 what happens right here it is cut it is kind of cut
8 8 and that 8 is the top of the rectangle but it is also what rectangle no
here what is this dimension right here this 12 p i mean the square the rectangle what does the 20 tell us the height of the whole thing the height of the whole thing from this point all the way down to this point
so which number am i going to use to find the area of the rectangle 12 so what are you going to multiply to find the area of the rectangle 12 so everybody do that do 12 times 8
back that is fine when you put the answer in the units yes
feet units are feet in this case right so in the middle of your square i want you to write that it is 96 feet squared
rectangle for the triangle so let us find the area of the triangle basically you guys had this shape right and from here to here is what 20 20 but this part is what 12 if i am taking the 12 away from the 20 what does that leave for the triangle
8 because you do 20 -12 which equals 8
20 i have already used 12 to find the rectangle so if i take this away i am left with 8 to be the height of the triangle so label in your triangle that the height is 8 and you guys already told me the base of the triangle
8 so what do i need to multiply 64 64 then what do you need to do next
2 good 34
close okay times when you did your division how many times can 2 go in to 4 twice so what is the area of my triangle
okay so now that i know that the rectangle is 96 and i know that the triangle is 32 what do i need to do to find the total of the whole figure
that good
what did you get 160 did you add 96 and 320 i did 96 +64
right yes okay this time then you can go to a different space on your paper i want you to do that okay
can i then go over it
okay you guys are doing a great job of following directions let us figure out what we know about our compound figure do i know the height of the squares what is the height of the squares
30 do you see how this goes from here all the way up to here 15 yes because it is labeled right here do i know the base of one of these rectangles yes no
here so one of them is 6 6 because we have 12 job we know that they are the same size so one must be 6 and the other one is 6 because 6 +6 makes 12 okay
then i need to find out the height of my triangle right if i know that this is 15 what is this side right here no 30 is from the very bottom all the way to the top 15 what does that leave for the height of the triangle a because 15 +15 equals 30
right the height of the triangle must also be 15 as well right because this 15 and this 15 together make 30 okay far yes 3 separate triangles yes and can you tell the group how you know that because the bottom is the same as the top right
this is 6 and the base of the triangle must also be 6 right so what we are going to do is let us find the area of each rectangle 1st if the base is 6 and the height is 15 what do i need to do
6 15 times 6 the base times the height good yes
6 yes what did you get for your answer 90 centimeters sure we can say it is centimeters does 90 count as both of the squares you tell me
question he said does the 90 centimeters eyes up here is that for just one of them or is that for both of them both now if you look the base and the length is 12 for the whole thing we just did 6 because 6 is just one of them
180 good mental math guys yes so they are going to be 180 for both of them together the whole area for both yes
180 so i can label each one 90 or together they are 180
now for the triangle what do i need to multiply to find its area half 15 times 6 then it is a triangle so what do you have to do
it it is the same thing well yes it is going to be 15 times 6 again but there is a 2nd step 2 but you would have a remainder right that is correct
remainder do the division it is an even number so can even numbers divide evenly by 2 without a remainder
90 90 divided by 20 okay 9 8 2 4 6 80 4
there is a remainder well it is an even number yes honey you need to do the long division i have gotten every single one wrong since i started i have not gotten one right are you drawing it out on your paper
trying opposite way remember the shape is going to be divided up
paper stop
over oops i messed up already hang on did you do 180 +45 or 90 +90 +45 now i am going to say this once 9 -8 is one
yes now that 10 divided by 2 there you go so what is the area of our triangle
45 so we know that the bottom rectangle the base of our house by base i mean the bottom is 180 and the triangle is 45
45 would you do it
128 where did you get 128 from there you go correct yes
225 let us do one more and then we will switch groups let us do one with a parallelogram
paper how about you do this maybe next time we are going to have you wanted this sheet
it is the square with the parallelogram on top
okay let us look at our figure here what is the height of my figure from the very very top to the bottom 50 okay which height am i missing for the height of the parallelogram do i know the height of the rectangle
30 50 is from here to here rectangle yes what can i easily find right away rectangle it looks like a square but you have to use different dimensions
30 well read it and then close it
know all you have to do is add zeros what is 30 times 10 300 i know the area for the rectangle is 300 units squared now do i know the base of the parallelogram out yes because it shares this side right yes it is 10
yes see how it shares this side with the rectangle it the base right here 10 now what i have to find is the height of the parallelogram if i know that from here to here is 50 eyes up here
me if from here to here is 50 but i am taking this away how much am i taking away here 30 what is left would be this 20 okay 20 so says we need to do 20 times 10
200 200 okay so if the parallelogram and i bet we can do this in our head too if the parallelogram is 200 and the rectangle is 300 what are they together 500 okay so when you guys were doing your okay
we are about to switch when you guys are doing your work okay i want you to imagine that you are taking the shapes apart
you know when you have to divide them and you have got to find that missing dimension imagine that you are taking it apart and ask yourself what is left for that dimension to be okay
quickly if i had another house and the height of the whole house is let us say 100 and the height of the square is 75 100 top to bottom the square is 75 what does that leave for the triangle to be
25 so that leaves 25 for the triangle left leave your shapes and crayons out for the next person and put your grid paper in your folder
all right kiddos it is time to switch if you are on the computers log off and let us switch places
that is weird look all this you have open down here at the bottom
it opens every page you did it that many times you clicked it a 1000000000 times
see still so it is actually not my fault there you go okay kiddos so we have been talking about area of compound figures right and something that i have noticed is that we are bad at them no
okay sometimes you guys have a hard time finding the missing dimension like if i tell you that this height from top to bottom if i told you that it was say 10 all the way from here to here but you needed the height of the triangle and i tell you the height of the square is 4 okay
if from here to here is 10 and this part is 4 what does that leave for the triangle to be 6 because if the whole thing is 10 all the way up and we already know that the square has 4 then that means that the triangle has 6 right because 6 +4 is 10
i appreciate that you are not playing with your shapes your pattern blocks and listening okay so what i want you to do on your grid paper i want you to trace this shape use your orange and your green crayon and trace the shape on your grid paper
then i want you to label it with these dimensions that i have right here for you we trace it that right there is what you are supposed to do
okay i need you to label the dimensions that means all the way from this highest point of the triangle all the way down to the base of the rectangle is 20
pencil that is fine i think it helps if you can see the different colors with the shapes tell me what you guys know about this compound figure
it it is a square and a triangle okay is it a square yes we used a square to trace because we do not have rectangles but is it a square if we look at the dimensions
square both okay i know that the base of this is what rectangle rectangle how do you know because if it was a square all the sides would be the same right a rectangle one side is not the same as the other
exactly one side is not the same as the other you need to take it through the steps now do i know the base of the triangle yes says yes yes no want to figure it out it may not be labeled but can i figure it out
8 can you tell us how you knew that because the base is 8 watch if this is 8 and then this is the top side of the square or the bottom of the triangle or rectangle it should be 8 right so you can go ahead and label that if you want to please
now yes can you tell us what to multiply for the rectangle 8 times 12 job so everybody do that 8 times 12
rectangle did everybody get 96 job 96 what feet squared now this is where it is going to get tricky we labeled that it was 20 feet from the very very top to the bottom
12 what is left to be the height of the triangle 8 and say 8 yes because if this is 12 12 +8 equals 20 and that was the total height
ms b can you explain again 12 +8 right because look
from here to here is 20 right top to the bottom but i have already used 12 of this because that is the rectangle 8 does that make sense i can not type anything in
box yes it is not letting you type what is that red stuff at the top say maker it only lets you practice so many times a day
triangle multiply 8 times 8 is 64 okay am i done no divide yeah you did 8 times 8 which is 64 and then you divide 64 by 2
key what about the numbers at the top of the keyboard
2 what if you do not need to do it and you already know it that is fine i have got the answer okay what did you get
math 64 divided by 2 63 8 times 8 is 64
so if the triangle is 64 and the rectangle is 96 the triangle is 32 that give everybody a chance to finish you do not add 64 because the triangles you divide in half
add it is time to switch already this what did you get i got 128
96 the 96 was the rectangle so 96 plus what you got for the triangle what did you get 128 good he wants me to e mail it to him
switch the key is remember when you guys are doing your assignment to think what the missing number is going to be when you have to take it apart okay
okay so for homework on monday night we worked on fractions decimals and percents and i asked you to go home and think about where you see these 3 things in your everyday world
everyday world means at home maybe something you saw on tv certainly at school when you go shopping when you are out playing when you are out driving around
all of these things are part of our everyday world so i am going to be asking for you to give me examples today that we can add to our chart of where we see fractions decimals and percents now i started you off on monday with one example of each
m one half of a sandwich okay so one half of a sandwich what about decimals
$9.63 for a shirt okay $9.63 like if you were going to buy something our example was if you were buying a shirt and what about percents
if you got an 88% on a test if you got an 88% on a test okay what examples did you find did you talk to your families about these things did they help you with this
m i did 16th out of the teachers like you are one of my teachers of the 6 teachers okay so is saying maybe you have 6 teachers
no how many teachers do you have in 6th grade 2 when you get up to the higher grades 7th and 8th grade especially in high school you may very well have 6 teachers but let us think about this in terms of your everyday world right now today how many teachers do you have 2
so i am one out of your 2 teachers okay on one whole orange one whole orange is this number one a fraction no not it is one whole
think about your orange did you eat it in pieces or did you just take the whole orange and put it in your mouth pieces how many pieces 3 you ate your orange in 3 pieces 4 in 4 pieces yeah really 6
5 when i eat an orange i take off the peel and i think about all of the pieces inside and i usually eat one little piece at a time okay so is orange was in 4 pieces the denominator tells me how many pieces there were in all 4 pieces in all how many pieces did you end up eating
244 ate 4 out of her 4 pieces i think any other examples of fractions 2 eighths of a pizza 2 eighths of a pizza so we got pizza last night for supper and it came cut in to 8 equal pieces
the denominator tells me how many pieces there are in all ate 2 out of the 8 so she ate 2 eighths of the pizza excellent anything else
i read 4 pages out of 10 pages in the book maybe in a chapter yeah p 4 out of 10
and you would write it as 4 in the numerator and 10 in the denominator nice so 4 tenths of the book excellent let us move over here to decimals this is a little bit trickier is not it where in your everyday world did you find decimals that is not money
a 98.6 for the temperature very good so a temperature 98.6 degrees for a temperature way when you are sick have you ever had a thermometer to check your temperature to see if you have a fever
sometimes thermometers are digital thermometers and you will read it as a decimal so in is case 98.6 k 0.25 i do not know it is like a all right so say it again for me
¢0.25 ¢0.25 so that is another way that we can show money cents another way to show a quarter would be 0.25 money what other examples can we come up with that is not money
radio 94.5 on the radio it is a radio station excellent where else do we see decimals 11 where did you see that
on my water 0 so in terms of measurement you might see it on a water bottle so has a water bottle has a water bottle if you take a look at some of these water bottles it will tell you in decimals how much water is in here okay
it says 16.9 fluid ounces so is water has 16.9 fluid ounces that is what you are talking about right excellent where else do we see decimals
8968.5 when you are doing gas when you are doing what gas like if you are at a gas station yes that is a great place so tell me at the gas station where you see that decimal is saying she is at the gas station and she sees a decimal i can think of 2 places that you can see a decimal there about gas station where in the gas station where are you seeing that number
i don t know what it is called but it is where you get the gasoline so outside of the car on the gas pump when you go to the gas station the next time take a look when your parents are pumping the gas you can see it registering as the gas gets pumped in to your car and that is in decimals it is in terms of gallons so maybe you are getting 12.4 gallons of gas
excellent now if you are just sitting there at the gas station and you are sitting in your car maybe even if you are driving but as long as you are in your car at the driver is seat there is another place that you might see decimals
is what is it so close it starts with an 0 mind i thought it was mileage yeah 0 do you know what that thing is that tracks your mileage i am not sure
okay it is called an odometer i know i know you knew that one an odometer okay so the odometer in your car tells you how far your car has driven percents where did you think of that you saw percents in your everyday world
sales sales you might go to a store and see a sign that says 20% off i love when i see those sale signs excellent where else do we see percents in our everyday world g in the store when you are buying milk when you are buying milk
example like if you want 2% sure maybe you buy 2% milk excellent where else
3% of the cake you would eat 3% of the cake so when you have a birthday party at the end of the party your mom says to you i think you ate too much cake tonight are you going to respond i know i ate 3% of the cake
not i do not think percents are used to describe how much of a cake we ate but let us think about it in terms of food how else can we use percent in terms of food we have it as 100% juice 2% milk
d how much percent is inside or how much percent vitamins are inside food 0 sure have you ever eaten something and you turn it over on the back and you see nutrition facts there are percents right there
if you are eating a granola bar it might say this bar contains 20% of your daily recommended amount of carbs or protein or your vitamins excellent so we will say the percent of let us do an example 20% of carbs vitamin d
it i will take one more for percents you know when they had those commercials and they would say like 5% of children have a disease or something maybe they use it in terms of describing a situation you could say 5% of the 5th grade regularly does their homework
is that a good amount or not so good amount got to fix that huh okay excellent let us move on today you guys did a great job if you see any up here that you do not have on your own charts feel free to add them because we might pull these out later on and you will be able to use them
just sneak out this way okay for the next part of today we are going to be playing a little game might be a little familiar to you it is called guess my rule
remember it is guess my rule guess my rule is a game where you are trying to guess what my rule is for the children that are up front okay so be looking at what similarities you might see
can i please have and can i please have okay so for i am not sure if you have ever played guess my rule before
in the other grades at the raymond school we have played guess my rule today we are going to be playing guess my rule and i want you to take a look at my 6 friends front there is something that i am thinking about that 3 of my friends have in common and that is my rule
everyone should be looking at my 6 friends what could my rule be think about what characteristics you see about these people
maybe it has something to do with their hair or their clothes or if they are a boy or a girl maybe it has something to do with how they are standing or where they sit in the classroom it could be anything s 3 of them are boys and 3 of them are girls you are right there are 3 boys up here and there are 3 girls but that is not my rule
everyone up here is wearing blue everyone up here is wearing blue so that would be 6 out of my 6 friends is wearing blue
i want you to think about a rule about only 3 of my friends only 3 of my friends 3 of them have short hair you are right but that was not my rule either so let us keep trying to think what other similarities that only 3 of them have in common
they have dark colors they all have kind of dark colors on so i would say all 6 of my 6 friends have dark colors on 6 that is the whole group i am thinking about only 3 out of my 6
s all of them are wearing sweaters what kind of sweaters you are on the right track
a zip up hoodie sweatshirts my rule was that 3 of my 6 friends up here are wearing zip up hoodie sweatshirts so does fit my rule no rule does fit my rule
yes yes fits my rule does fit my rule no go sit down bye bye does fit my rule no ya so my rule is zipped up hoodie sweatshirts thank you friends you may go sit down
so guess my rule can you think of ways to represent the 3 out of 6 friends who fit my rule
i could write 3 out of 6 friends fit my rule do how else could i say 3 out of 6 or how else can i write 3 out of 6 a so if i put can i challenge you
if i put 3 over 6 can you use some of this vocabulary 63 in my numerator and 6 in my denominator denominator excellent job 63 sixths remember the t h s on the end okay
who else 50% 50% of the students who were up here were wearing zipped up hoodie sweatshirts what else 0.5 excellent so we have a fraction a percent a decimal how about just a word
can i write this as just a word right i could write one half or i could just say half half of my friends fit the rule okay
far you good you should be taking notes on this friends these are all different ways to write the same thing is 3 out of 6 equivalent to 3 sixths yes is 3 sixths equivalent to 50% is 50% equivalent to half
make observations are things you can look at and see and notice
make how many
grid forget about everything else on that paper what do you notice what do you observe about just this grid say it again there is 100 squares yes in the 1st grid there are 100 squares
what are the dimensions of this grid every hand should be up because it says it right here on this paper what are the dimensions
grids each of these grids represents 100 squares what are we working on right now where we are talking a lot about 100 100% percent exactly so that is all we are going to do today we are going to use these grids to understand what percent means
100 we said that 3 out of 6 is equivalent to 50% so does that mean that if i said i ate half the cookies that every time i said half or 50% that it equals 3
why why does 50% not always equal 3 does we are talking about 3 out of 6 is equivalent to 50% but 50% does not always mean 3
m 50% does not always equal 3 because if you had like 3 3 out of 6 is half of 6 and 6 is everything and 50 is half of 100 and 100 is everything so if you had 3 out of 8 50% would not be 3
excellent who could tell me in their own words what just said do you want to give it a try
was saying that not everything is going to be half of sometimes it is going to so if you went through 3 out of 5 there would still be 2 left and it is not like 3 so it would not be exactly half right yeah so just because you see 50% does not mean it equals 3
50% when you see the percent sign it means out of 100 so 50 like and said 50 is half of 100 right just like 3 is half of 6
your job right now is i want you on this very 1st grid you can use crayons or a pencil but no markers on this very 1st grid can you do me a favor and shade in half of the grid so there are 100 squares and i want you to shade in half of them
now when you say half do you mean 50 you shade in just half so half will be shaded half will be un shaded and you can do that any way that you want any design that you want okay excellent job
how did you decide to do that i counted the 10s the 5s then i counted this side by 5 and sliced it in the middle did you double check your work excellent job
do not forget your name on that okay thank you you are welcome can you tell me how you did that i counted down 50 because there is 10 in each row
i went 10 20 30 40 50 then i shaded 50 then i left the other 50 blank excellent very good okay i see a few of you still finishing up
about 15 more seconds how did you do this one i colored by 10s so i counted to 5 so you counted by 10 5 times 10 20 30 40 50 5 excellent how did you do this one
you when you did this one and you counted 10 here you can not double count this square to count a 10 over here this way can you so you have 10 here but now there is only 9 squares left over here be careful make sure you do exactly how many squares need to be shaded in
one if you are going to color in half of this how many squares will need to be shaded 50 right so make sure that you count and do exactly 50 okay okay
i want you to take the next 30 seconds and turn to a partner and share not just hey this is what i did but share how you did it what was your strategy for shading in half now i shade up to 5 be ready to share okay
do you want to hop over and work with them bring your paper thank you
b what did you share i went down 5 and i knew there was 50 how did you know if you went down 5 that it is 50
because i counted it down then i counted to 10 and i went down excellent okay
so can i have your eyes back up here for a minute there were 100 squares to start right yes and i asked you to shade in half of them how many squares were shaded in 5 there are 5 rows and how many squares in each row
10 10 so what is 5 times 10
50 50 absolutely we shaded in 50 squares well i said shade in half of the grid and you shaded in 50 squares so could we say that one half equals 50% yes
that we also could say that one half equals who said one whole would you rather have half of a cookie or the whole cookie the whole so they are not equal are they no one half equals 50% and how could we write this as another fraction over 100
because our grid had 100 squares 50 okay here is your challenge
i want you to take the next grid right next to the one where you showed 50% and i want you to divide that grid in to 4 equal pieces and i want you to shade in one of those 4 equal pieces
your job is to do the same thing but for 14th so here is your grid
i need you to divide it in to 4 equal pieces so it is still 100 squares but instead of dividing it in to 2 equal pieces you are going to divide it in to 4 equal pieces and shade in one of those 4 pieces so you are going to shade in 14th of your grid
do that now 50 for this grid you do not know how many are going to be shaded in yet so i want you to just take this and find an easy way to divide it in to 4 equal pieces 25
you are right that is what it is going to be okay but how are you going to show that you need to draw it out and then shade in just one of those pieces wait just shade in 25
well you could because that would still be 25% but for the very 1st one i want you to find a way to take this whole grid and divide it in to 4 equal pieces okay
this you tell me how you want to do it okay sure if you are done see if you can tell me any of the information that we found over here
what would be a word that we could use for 14th like one half 4 how many squares are you coloring in
what percent do you think it is and what number is it over 100 out if you have already shaded it in you have already shaded in 14th because one in the numerator and 4 in the denominator you read that as 14th okay with the t h on the end
so you are trying to figure out how many squares what is the percent what is the number over 100
if you are someone i see a few people that are ready to move on if you are someone who has this done go on to the 3rd grid and show me 14th using a different design
how else could we represent 14th using a different design many of you in fact everyone i have seen so far has split their grid evenly in half this way then again this way to make 4 equal pieces okay see if you can find a different way to do it
we are not moving on to this one yet
just worry about the top part this is 50% right so 14th and 14th did you find out how many squares you colored in yeah i just focused on the middle and how many squares did you color in
12345 i did like 25 excellent so i see that you wrote 29% and i was a little worried but you know it is 25% do not you yeah absolutely did you still trade in 25 squares you did you just have to count those half squares so what is one half of a square +one half of a square a 100 think about it
if i have half of a square plus half of a square and i put them together i get a whole yeah a whole square okay guys what is a word to represent 14th a quarter a quarter think in terms of money a quarter is 14th of a dollar
dollar 44 so you could use the word quarter how many squares did we shade in if i asked you to shade in 14th how many squares make up 14th 25 so then what percent is it
t 25% 25% 25 excellent 25 over 100 here now let us use the fraction 14th
half we did the fraction one half now let us work with 14th
good 14th is equivalent to 25% which also equals 25 i am asking
go okay how do you feel about this good can i of course you can so you are now starting to know some different equivalent fractions and percents
d ¢50 but how are you going to write that
0.50 this is half of the whole dollar how am i going to write 14th or 25% of the whole dollar
0 and 25 hundredths excellent or 0.25 or if you did it with a dollar sign ¢25 okay before we wrap up i have one last challenge for you today okay we have done one half
4th i want you to take the next grid on your paper and i want you to divide it in to 8 equal squares so we have done half
we have done 4th now we are going to work on one out of 8 and i want to know the word squares the percent and the fraction here is a hint
you already divided this one in to 4th if i wanted to make it in to 8 each of these would have to be divided in half again
no how are we going to do this one remember all 8 pieces have to be equal
so if you started with this and you have 4 equal pieces the bad news is you can not just go in and divide each of these like this g there are 5 rows here so when you divide it like this you have 3 rows over here and 2 rows over here work so think about it this way
you know that this whole block here is 25 squares you know that you need to divide this section in half again so what do you think half of 25 is
you could go ahead and split it this way and try it like that squares 2 halves equal one whole okay of each square this is a challenge together talk it out with your partner see if you can get this figured out
it you are going to divide it here right now you want to shade in just this amount so in order to find out what percent 18th equals what do you need to do yeah in order to find out what percent 18th equals what do you have to do
that was awesome now though you need to count all these boxes if you put these and these together it makes a whole you have got it girl now i want you to explain it to the rest of your group okay okay and how are you doing i know you can not divide it like that can you
you can not make these numbers equal you can not split it in half this way did you split it right down the middle of the box
okay if you can see this then that is fine you are going to count the you are going to shade 18th okay so you are going to count all these boxes right but these are not whole boxes are they that is a half of a box
box what does half plus half equal okay so that is another half and another half so count up and see how many boxes you actually shaded in and i want you to work with on this the 3 of you can work together right okay that is how good it is
i need a volunteer to come up and tell me what is the percent you got honey on this yeah you have to know that before you come up is you have to know 18th equals what percent before you can come up
very good are you prepared to explain how you did it though okay so is ready to come up
he has his answer but he is not going to tell you what he got for an answer right instead he is going to tell you what he did to find his answer but do not tell them what the answer is you promise all right go ahead you promise go ahead all eyes up front please nice and loud
half keep going show us what you did
so now he has 8 equal pieces on the board okay in so he shaded in 18th so shade in 18th but now what did you do because that still does not tell me what percent that is
do tell the class i counted the squares so he counted the squares thank you job when he counted the squares it is really easy to count the whole squares is not it
squares the difficult part comes with counting some of these ones right in through here squares if you take a half of a square plus another half of a square and put them together it becomes one whole square
118th 18th is filled in right so this represents 18th of my whole grid because my grid is divided in to 8 equal pieces and i shaded in one out of my 8 pieces but what percent does that equal how many squares did i shade in here
up here you have to look at your paper and you have to count up those squares okay so it is more than 12 one 2 it is
one 2 so 12 one 2 squares are colored in
4 it is 12 and one 2 squares so if it is 12 and one 2 squares what percent does that equal 12.50 100 not just 12
yesterday you played another game right yeah by the way did you all get your homework done last night
raise your hand if you had a homework pass okay raise your hand if you forgot to do your homework and you didn t have a homework pass i had a pass okay how many of you had a 5 problem reduction pass right so at least you all took care of your homework if you were supposed to do that last night right
good okay yesterday we played with the cubes
skill now what is it called when you have say 2 digits and you change the order what is that order what is that called sarah commutative property right now what happens when you throw in parenthesis what s that
okay
why because you have 3 digits and you put 2 times 4 in parenthesis and have 8 +6 +6 in parenthesis it s 14 times 2 can you come and write that on the board for us and give us an example
and what skill does that relate to that we wanted to share in 5th grade math a please my what is it called order of operations with please please my dear who
dear division aunt add sally subtraction that s right that s right okay so it looks like we ve got 2 times 4 +6 class parenthesis parenthesis this is 10 okay explain this to us
see because look at the 1st one us 2 times 4 is 8 +6 is 14 okay us 0 okay
side 2 different answers right yes and that all just depends upon what order she put the numbers in and where she put the parenthesis correct yes okay that s what your game is going to be about today
game you all haven t played this before but we re going to practice it before you get in groups of 2 to play this game board you re going to have little tiles to mark your spaces on the game board timer and it s going to be a group of 2 playing another group of 2
partner and your goal is to create your figure before the other 2 people get theirs created word we usually use this vocabulary word in social studies but we re going to talk about it in math today too
contiguous raise your hand if you ve heard that word before j i ve heard it before do you know what it means honey no
no okay if we say that our 48 states are contiguous and alaska and hawaii are not considered to be part of the 48 contiguous states why is that g because they re not put together they re not put together or they don t . connect
touch the other 48 states at least on one side it touches another state alaska it doesn t touch any of our other states does it okay so that s the meaning of contiguous
in math on this game board i m going to show you the meaning of contiguous do you see this all these tiles touch at least the side of one other tile
contiguous the corners touch but do the sides touch
count these would be some examples of . hmmm contiguous 5 contiguous tiles goal to get something that looks similar to these count a tile all the way up here one here
either so let me read these directions to you and then we re going to get i m going to get 2 of you and then we re going to practice this and you re all going to watch it okay you will need a game board with these numbers on it
you will have a set of 3 dice you will have 20 colored markers each of 2 colors you re going to play with 2 teams team that way you can help each other out a little bit especially since this is the 1st time you ve played this game
you must be the 1st 2 to capture 5 contiguous squares on the game board right huh player one rolls the 3 dice the player has one minute to create an expression using the 3 numbers
minute okay 1st so when you get your container that s the 1st thing you need to do the value of the expression is the number on the board that will be captured and covered with a tile the value of the expression
so s 2 answers expressions for example if a player rolls a 43 and 6 the expression might be this okay we rolled 4 a 3 and a 6
the expression might be 6 +3 in parenthesis times 4 yes and that could be used to capture which square please parenthesis parenthesis 6 +39 okay
do 4 times 4 which is . 3636 so that would be one of your options is to find the 36 on the board and put a tile on it
after covering the square with a marker the player passes the dice to his opponent and records his expression on paper now what are you going to be doing for that full minute 6 you and your partner are each going to have a piece of notebook paper after you see that those are your 3 numbers you re going to be given one minute
accomplished you need to write down as many different expressions as you can using those 3 numbers using different operation symbols and placing the parenthesis in different places
yes because when the one minute is up you re going to want to have as many different options different number choices to look for on here and then you re going to decide which number you want to go with which value you want to go with to place your tile on here
it your next roll you re going to be looking to place another tile that you hope will be beside it so that it s contiguous so it shares a side no probably not because then you aren t going to have as many options to choose from the next time
this and bring your chair right here chair now i would like hang on
if you come gather right around here you have to get down on your knees so that other people behind them can stand up and see over you
so do you have a pencil okay you re going to watch 1st
partner when we roll the dice let s say it s and his partner s turn they roll 3 numbers they re both going to write as many expressions as they can so they have more options to choose from okay so he s going 1st he s going 1st and you re going to be the timer watcher
bottom you got to wait til says go over then you re going to roll the dice write down your 3 numbers and then start writing down as many expressions as you can think of go 4 okay write down your numbers
okay has a 13 a 21 a 24 and a 15 job do you see any of those numbers on this board
you guys can help him okay there s a 21 2124 and there s 13 now where do you think you d like to place your tile them the 21
there now it s this team s turn with this invisible teammate has here go same numbers cover your paper hang on let s do this again so you don t have the exact same numbers we ll do this okay
again shake them up a little there you go go we didn t want to use the exact same numbers again and you all you be thinking too
it okay circle your values 30123030 okay a 30 a 12 and a 30 numbers the 12 is in the middle okay now wait you have an option here
you can place your tile in hopes of starting your contiguous pattern or you can put a tile to block his if you would like i i i okay did you all hear what i just mentioned just now you have the option of putting a tile to block theirs if you would like
that you may want to go ahead and start your own and work on that okay these it was a fun game okay you all go back to your seats quickly pencil guys
voices all right every person needs a sheet of notebook paper so everybody is going to have to have a sheet of notebook paper people and you re going to have one game board for 4 people
teams you re going to take what you need and go to a desk desk here we go they re all mixed up
supplies and these 2 people will be playing against and team 14 and 21 you need one of these desk scoot
like or if you want to go on the floor and use a dry erase board to give you more room why don t you all do that okay we ve go plenty of dry erase boards these 2 people are a team 10 and these 2 people are going to play opposing and
2
15 and 7 okay do you have one of these you can go to a desk if you want to go
okay guys 5 you need to be settled and ready to begin up do you have your timers turned
2345 busy you guys are going 1st no you guys are going you come over here
are okay guys can you wait for a moment before you start another one
listen it doesn t make a lot of sense for the 2 people on the opposing team to just be sitting there okay one of you does need to be watching the timer the other one could be writing out expressions using those same numbers to check the opposing team to see if you come up with any of the same values right
so take turns watching the timer but one of the 2 people on the opposing team should also be trying to write expressions ahead did you check okay because you know the opposing team you re going to have to watch to make sure those values are correct
addition subtraction multiplication division
freeze after you get maybe 3 tiles and you ve got 2 more tiles to finish out your pattern so that you can win you re going to have to start looking at the numbers around your pattern on the board right
to see what values you need to finish that pattern that might determine which operation symbols and the order in which you place your digits to create that value that you need saying that s why your thinking right now you re probably thinking why would i want to use subtraction i ll end up with maybe a smaller number well why would i want to use division
i may end up with a smaller number because usually you re playing a game and you re trying to get large numbers this time you want to go for you want to look to see what numbers you might need to get the numbers that you might need to help you to win and finish out your pattern
it s kind of fun to try that to see what s going to happen you know you never know until you try it stop i ll come deliver you more paper
ready no time to waste
maybe you ll get a 60 or a 41 huh
so if you can t block your opponents and you can t put a contiguous tile down you re just going to have to start another pattern and yield
board yeah
tiles yeah keep working time s wasting
numbers 956 i got 85759 you can t put it there block you should we put it there
that before placed his tile he consulted with his partner and said should we put it here i like that
yeah ready set
9121520 ooh
this you got a 15 yeah i got a 15 you got a 20 that one s a 20 20 the 20 is way up here though well do you want to block them or do you want to keep working on your pattern okay ready keep working
yellow you guys are yellow you don t have any of the other numbers close to the yellows
1010 will be connected here okay what about your other 2 yellows though and have 24 and 12
well think of how many tiles think of . they ve got 2 more tiles right if they place those 2 green tiles around the other 3 where would they place them work that would work
work if they place it on the 44 would that help also so just think about your options we got 22
28 and 30 what color are y all red that s a good decision okay
start again okay you re getting there now it s my turn to watch the timer ready set
one i ve got a group that if they can get the correct number they will win
down all 5 of their tiles down yeah see if the yellow team gets this number the yellow team will win because they ll all touch contiguous
4 if you could get a 15 or a 60 or a 21 or a 34 you re in business okay
okay you have to have 5 contiguous tiles now it may take you more than 5 tiles to get there because you re pattern may have gotten blocked or you may have your pattern spread out
i need another piece of paper i ve been working out the problem and i got a 45
working it s a race to see who s going to win i m looking around and you are all at about the same place as far as the number of tiles and . -4 is 21
care 3 people are solving writing out expressions okay this is a learning opportunity
where are your numbers board 40 here 21 here and 29 there and what color are you blue blue you have 29 i think what you do you have 25 well i think we should just do 21
most of these are even numbers then maybe you ll get a 14 or a i need a 14 or a anyway or a 130 you have to have 5 no they have to be 5 contiguous ones
that may take you it may take you 9 or 10 tiles to reach your 5 contiguous tiles to get to that point so it could be the next time you need to try to get a you all are red then yes you re blue yes
red if only you could get an 80 no we are going to win
if you re green let me come check 1234 all right i got a 21 okay hang on
okay don t bump your board
wow
80 that s a rare occurrence now what if this happens what if we get a all right everybody freeze
yet place your tile yep okay now when i tell you it s time to stand up you have to be very very careful that you don t bump your game board and your tiles slide off
where are we going you re going to make 2 stops because there s 2 game boards i want you to take a look at all right when you come over here to this game board you will see that the yellow team has 5 tiles that are contiguous even though they have 6 yellow tiles on the board 5 of them are now contiguous
this team was almost there 80 this team when you come by and look at their tiles they also needed an 80 for both teams on this group over here they do have a winner
out yours are spread out spot shhh angel
okay eventually go take a look at their game board too good 8686 okay yes go back to your spot who needs more paper does
the blue team okay
rounds get busy you guys could go ahead and start another game if you wanted to can we switch teams hmmm can we switch teams you want to switch teams
another i ll give you a couple of more minutes and then we re going to do a little summary activity to wrap this up
no top there s a one
what else do you have there s 21
all right listen up listen i know that many of you are close and some of us have started another game
timer somebody bring me the container and the game board thank you
where s your timer
you i m counting to 5 and you need to be at your seats and ready to listen
2345 okay now that you know how to play this game the next time that we play this game you will work with just one other person
2 i also think the next time we play the game i think we may try it where you have to place your tile also within that one minute 0 goodness yeah so you re going to have to really think fast
i don t know maybe the 2nd time we play we ll add that component it on the back or the front we ve got one wrap up activity to do here before we go to the restroom
no that got changed
do you have your name on your paper
do it doesn t do us any good at all if we don t learn something from these math games right way sometimes we have to do it just plain old pencil and paper and work out problems on paper but when you play math games you need to learn something from it so your job now is to prove to me what you ve learned
here s what i would like for you to do i would like for you to use as many math vocabulary words as you can okay you all owe me this later okay
later i want you to use as many hello you re back with me now i want you to use as many math vocabulary words as you can and write down all the skills that you used in this math game
words i ll give you a clue we talked about a couple of them before you even started playing the game
okay when you are satisfied with what you put on your paper one at a time you may bring me your papers i ll look at it and see if i think you ve given me enough information
if so then you may go to the restroom if not then you ll have to go back to your desk and write some more so if you think you re happy with it you may bring it to me
did you use multiplication go back and get it okay up it okay did you use operations
okay boys and girls i need you to be working on your math message
you have warm up it should not take more than 5 minutes to finish that up
do not forget to reduce do not write the words because it will take longer and i want us to get done with this as quickly as possible c that is right no did i do any division on the board baby when i just converted 7.34 to 7 and 34 hundredths did i do any division
did i took the whole number made it a whole number you have your whole number do you have your whole number where is the whole number in this decimal there is no 10 in that number card where is the whole number in that number 3 and 5 tenths where is the whole number i can not see what you are pointing at
good now they ate .5 of another pizza .5 also known as 5 tenths that let us get going then we also talked about sometimes fractions can be what
fraction what can go into 5 and 10 to reduce it ever good all right it i see you
why do i keep putting these back up here you keep taking them
do not touch them again
3.5 okay i will be right with you
one it is 3 and 5 tenths where is the whole number so write that as a whole number 3 whole pieces
then you ate .5 of another pizza when you say .5 that means 5 tenths this place is what places this right here place write 5 over 10
pass those out please yes you did honey that is beautiful how are you doing
100 just reduce that i should not have done that okay we will just leave it maybe that is what it is
you you need to fix those ones
time 2 and 3 hundredths that is 2 and 3 what
that is why i said you were rushing and i want you to fix those 2 more minutes and we go over the math message the math review
2 number 2 5.6 no
and was right 5 and 6 hundredths what is this place called this is the ones part the tenths what is this place called
now if this is 5.6 like you said you write 5 and 6 t e n t h now your words are right decimal 5 write 5 as a whole number
fraction excellent now take it one step further and reduce now what do you do what number right and what is it
0 how many times does 2 go into 10 i told you you must have been rushing because you are going to have to redo all that i was rushing why did you leave the rest of them sitting on your desk
are they extras or something you could have gave them to me needs one on if you finished your math work on the board i can take that
just give me one sheet i do not want all those papers thank you that was right 1st write it in words
it why do you need to put it over 10 you i see never turned one
there is no division such as this when you are just converting a fraction into a decimal you take the 1st number which is we take a decimal which is a fraction and i asked you to reduce and when you reduce you divide 5 into the factors of 5 and 10
find the greatest common factor then you divide by the greatest common factor the whole number stays the same 10 divided by 5 is 2 this is how we do this now we are doing this one
numbers you find the greatest common factor and then you divide by the you do not divide 5 into 6 way let us work on this we will find the greatest common factor for 6 and 10 and then divide the multiples by doing multiples you are doing factors into 6
okay let me have some volunteers thank you for working on this assessment let us go over this work on the board you can fill it in while we finish it up 1st let us do our math message 8.5
fractions i keep telling you they are where they always are on the bottom of one of those drawers you know where everything else is
circle the whole decimal 1st that is what we are converting into a fraction show me with a picture what does 3.5 pieces look like somebody help her out
you put another pizza and then put 5 pepperonis what are the other ones many how many pieces are in this pizza this is a whole one 2 3
.5 which you all told me was now looking at my beautiful fractions thank you 10 say it again all all right show me 5
s simplest form there are 3 ways to say it it will say reduce the fraction it may say show the fraction in simplest form or it may say just simplify
simplify means reduce how do you reduce tell me how you reduce 5 tenths find the greatest factors divide by 5
answer we have got these fractions 3 of those 3.5 pizzas excellent good job these are the same thing words and fractions okay
so they need to say it is important to be able to know how to convert decimals you need to be able to read this word 5.6 that is like the short way to say it
if you want to say it in a correct and appropriate and how it is actually supposed to be said you want to read this as 5 and 6 tenths good how about money how would this be in a money form
e that is what you all think that is not right it is not 5 if it was 5 and 6 tenths it would have to look like this $5 no tenths ¢6 remember because this means 6 pennies now we can do it
yes ¢60 all right let me get a helper
i have a question while he is working on that if i added 2 tenths more what would be my new decimal please do not get it out i added 2 tenths more
teacher 5 and 6 tenths reduce is correct excellent thank you 3
you are you ready to go on the field trip
okay let me tell you something the 1st word is and 34 what place is this right after the decimal 10s tenths with a t h
remember if i has a decimal the next one we will do is thousandths excuse me is thousandths we do 1000s regular 1000s to the decimal point we go 2 places
34 do not put the 0 put it right here
now we are going to write it
100 so once it gets to 99 which would be think of wholes as one whole says it is going to be less than 100 pieces
t that is good that is the fraction we have still got to work on now we have got to reduce put equals now over here so you can actually reduce this to 17
bad i thought you were writing it on top
what are you doing we are on 17 boy by what can we use to reduce it
one this is our last one let us see if has it
you i am videotaping 8 hundredths 8 over 100
you missed one step simplify what number goes do not say 2
25 what number in fourths would give me when i tell you in decimals always think money
reduce you know how to reduce try again what are you dividing by sweetie 4
4 stop listening to everybody behind you 100 divided by 4 25 that is right confidence you have got to have it
do you go up here and let everyone talk when you know what to do
me all right 1st i am going to go over this was a decimal test just to see we have already talked about naming decimals comparing decimals and rounding decimals today we take it a step further
we are converting decimals into fractions we have already done a little bit of that but now we are going to do some converting that is not going to be so easy 100 i want to make sure that we are all on the same page as far as what we already knew about decimals so i will use this as a pretest
tomorrow i am going to give a similar test on decimals on comparing naming and rounding so i can have a pretest and a post test score you are going to have to have that part down before you move to converting fractions into decimals you are going to be lost if you are lost on this number one put them in order from least to greatest
what is the key to remember putting decimals in order from least to greatest what do you have to do up you need to line them up and then just compare down the rows
so if i had i do not know they all have 6s and 4s i made up my own
up make a little chart line up your decimals they are not in order actually say these numbers go to what place
thousandths good job you guys said thousandths these are hundredths i want them all to match now they are all matching they all have the same numbers
row this is all the same and i am going from least to greatest so i am looking for the smallest number 1st i have got a 404 i am getting rid of 4s because those are high right yes so it has got to be one of the 0 numbers right yes so these are the same
0 which one is smaller 0 that is number one if that one is number one then the next one i am looking at 2 okay
0 same now if i did not have this right here some of us might be a little confused 0 no 0 now i know 4 and 0 which one is bigger 4 the 4 is bigger so which one is number 3 this one when comparing decimals line them up
that one equals 6 feet and 6 miles equals 6 times 6 that when comparing we make a chart to place value number 2 that was really easy s we need to grade yours because you did not turn yours in
what is the highest use your paper grade please i have to come back to you 2.03 very good turn the page number 3 tom ran a race in 27 and 34 hundredths of seconds
it took barry 100th of a 2nd longer to run the race longer add subtract multiply divide it took barry 100th of a 2nd longer
c subtract hmmm it is addition if someone took longer than you say it took you 5 minutes to go to the bathroom it took 5 minutes and 3 seconds it took her longer you would add okay sweetie okay we are on the next page
on tom rand 27 and 30 fourths seconds which looks like this how would i add 100th of a 2nd longer
ms so it took barry 100th of a 2nd let us write that down 1st
100th just write that number decimals 100th how would you write 100th write it right here you are always doing that
now that says 110th you are close we want 100th that is not right read that that is one whole i want 100th excuse me
100th you are on the right track now
this 100 now how do i convert this into a decimal and go backwards all you have got to do is draw that so i have got to tell myself i have 2 zeros in 2 places
there is only one so i put that in one place that says 100th if it is one thousandths i would have to put 1234 i am not even going to add it up anyway this is what tom ran
barry ran 100th more which we said was to add the key to adding decimals add the decimals up 0.001 why not
why can not i add them like that erase that 0 now what why can i not add this because put the decimal right there so in other words i have to line the decimals up
once i line the decimals up 100th is 100th once i read 100th i can add them up
number 4 kevin is mother told him to buy 7 tenths of a pound a pound is one whole he wants to buy 7 tenths of a whole each is marked to show its weight it is definitely not any whole number because he wants to buy a part of a whole number b
d which of those reads 7 tenths everybody c
say 110th good job you guys i put number 7 that reads 7 and 110th number 5 they gave us a model and they gave you a key
in this model we have already seen this model several times please do not do that how many parts in the model 85 i mean all together 100 you aint got to count them baby this is a 100 chart remember when we 1st started decimals we used these
we use this if you do not have a good understanding of decimals red hopefully most of us are past the shading portion that can just look at the numbers and figure out what to do if you get 0.85 and you do not exactly know what that means then you take your lovely 100 chart and fill in how many 85 85 out of how many 100
so they circled 85 they want the shaded everyone knows that is 85 write that as a fraction how do i write the unshaded what is the unshaded portion of the decimal so 15 he knows 85 +15 gives you 100
so if it is 85 shaded it is 15 not shaded out of 100 and that converts to a decimal that is what
it is not funny i did not say 300
t h i make it 100th you think it is funny but i am saying it because i want you to i am not saying 100 in front of the decimal i am saying 100th behind the decimal so which one says 300th d
b b does not say 3 hundredths b says what 0 but we do not say it with the hundredths we say tenths and hundredths and ands b 0 and 30 hundredths 30 hundredths you can drop the 0 and say 3 tenths same thing 3 tenths is 30 c how would you read c
3 thousandths if we are talking about money we would say we are talking about a whole we would just say 3 so the answer was a 3 and 3 hundredths zeros tenths hundredths 3 hundredths number 7 which problem shows the number 0.45
i want to say that in words
answer which shows the number written in words
job number 81 nickel is worth 5 hundredths of a dollar one nickel 5 hundredths that says ¢5 i am just working out of my mind give me a 2nd i have not even looked at the question yet
down for me trying to understand how one nickel excuse me sit up please equals 5 hundredths of a dollar one nickel ¢5 tenths to the whole number which of the following represents 5 hundredths of a dollar a says what
$5 b says what ¢50 c says what d there is no money that looks like that
homework it s also been the topic that you ve been working on with me and we can work in a small group and that way we all get a better understanding so let s go ahead and break off into our lesson so 1st things 1st everybody should have their math do now journal out so we can write this down okay
d a good job journal s got his out hers that s everybody okay so let s get started
rate we ve talked about what it is in terms of what we use it for but today i m going to give you the actual definition on so rate is a comparison by division of 2 quantities with unlike units amount so it s going to be the cost of something
something it could be miles that you ve driven quantity so whenever we re doing rate you know automatically that you re going to do what operation division division 2nd thing also too know that sometimes when you re asked for a rate they may ask you one rate and then another rate that has something to do with the same thing
so be looking for that when you get to operations and word problems rotation so when you get to that rotation those are multistep problems so make sure that you re paying attention to what you need to do 1st 2nd 3rd etcetera so let s go ahead and do our examples so our example says why don t you read it
example how on 12nd can everybody hear
bit container so 1st thing s 1st
we need to find out how many servings per container dividing because we know when we look for rate we re always going to divide 32 close
8 so we re going to divide 32 into 8 equal categories or groupings 8 because this is one of our basic facts invert your multiplication tables 1st so there are 4 servings per container now we want to know how many calories are in the entire case container
so the rate of calories per container now as opposed to per serving which is what we already had so what do we need to do now to find out how many calories in the whole container multiply multiply what by what 80 times 4
240 i mean 320 320 so 4 servings per container and 320 calories okay so that s pretty much the same thing we re going to do
although we re going to take it to the next level and we re going to do several more examples when you meet with me a group a e h t all of you guys are going to be going to green 1st to practice computation raise your hand if you re in group b i mean sorry you re going to be going to red with me 1st
b m a k and h you guys are all going to be going to green practicing computation c you guys are going to be at blue that means you re working on selecting operation and decoding word problems rotation we re going to be at that place for 20 minutes
at the end of each 20 minute cycle i m going to blow my whistle is and then well i put it in my purse and then we re going to move to the next station if you forget what your next rotation is please just refer to the chart on the wall h yeah at the end of our time together we re going to go ahead and turn our materials in
as you know what we get done during this time depends well tell who s going to recess and who s not work i don t have my whistle so go ahead and do move to your 1st rotation if you are with me at concept inquiry the red table we are working in our math journal volume 2 on page 337
green same table as yesterday there the index cards are on the table
red hold on a 2nd this goes with that table this goes with that table which one
that do the timed ones 1st do the timed 11st 4 minutes okay all right ladies and gentlemen remember we are working together but we are using our classroom voices
yes we are using our classroom voices okay page 337
no put your arms in your sleeves 335 and 336 is homework so we re doing which one are we doing i was here late yesterday that s homework we re not doing that
337 okay so we re doing more of the unit pricing today so these are really good skills that will help you in your life who goes 0 the grocery store with mom or dad or grandma or auntie or whomever i go so when we go to the grocery store what do you notice about items
it now even if something is in a package of say more than one thing does it have several prices or is there just one price so sometimes it s hard for us to figure out whether or not something is a good deal sale so let s say you have 2 different products and there s the same amount of something in it and they re 2 different prices because one of them is on sale so let s say one is $4.99 and the other is $3.99
and you don t know which one is the better deal because maybe they have a different amount of something is and what you need to do is find what s called a unit price so what it costs for each one of them and we started working on that yesterday over here in content inquiry so we re going to just continue that today now what we see in our application today is we re given a price and then we re given an amount of something
so the quantity so we re given 2 quantities because remember rate is a comparison or 2 quantities okay so would you read the 1st one per ounce so what rate are we looking for per ounce that s why we say a rate
the price per ounce is this and that gives you the rate so that s the language that i want you guys start to use everybody say what you re looking for in this particular problem did you say it price per per ounce price per ounce is what we re looking for okay so what we do in order to find it is what
rate we divide we divide so the 1st thing i want you to do is to underline the quantities that you re dealing with good 15 ounces and $3.60 all boys and girls we re a little too noisy
at the converge at the computation table okay so now that we okay set it up correctly
it okay so we ve all got the problem set up it can we divide 3 by 13
36 yeah how many times can 15 go into 36 problem and now we have yeah bring that 0 down and how many times can 15 go into 60
4 okay so how much is it per ounce remember we have done it yet so you have to do something else once you did that up bring up your decimal so it s 20% so what is the price per ounce ¢24 let s write that in
okay so let s do the next one now
one per pound so what is the price per pound 1st of all let s underline our quantity rate is a comparison by division of 2 quantities with unlike units quantities you ve got one quantity what s the other so what do we need to do
we underline the quantity £2 and the quantity of $7 you don t have those amounts i ll be right back guys guys we re really loud you re really loud we should be in our whisper voices
i ll be right back i need to tell them the same thing no you only have 4 minutes you re just doing the one in 4 minutes okay now guys you re way too loud
good you re too loud and then i m finished with the whole thing good then put those in the box it put your name on it what i m seeing is not good and i mean you can keep on top and just stay in your seat but if you can t do that then unfortunately you re going to have to go to the
boys and girls she just said boys and girls voices area perimeter next and on the back of that your finding
no good very good are we working together helping one another okay so on the next one let s go ahead and underline a quantity excuse me you guys are way too loud
whisper boys and girls i m going to have to stop this and we re going to have to work independently if we cannot use our classroom voices we know that when we work in groups it s necessary for us to talk to each other but we also know that we don t talk really loudly
because if you are talking too loud then the group next to you won t be able to hear each other and then they ll speak louder and then what we end up having is a bunch of noise and no one can hear anyone so please classroom voices whisper people sitting at your table will still hear you okay so we re underlined our quantities
16 because we know every pound has 16 ounces and we also have how much else we have 5 so what do we need to do we divide a comparison by division of 2 quantities with unlike units it where s all the math coming from
stay on the same path divide 34 divided by 16 okay how many times do you think
make a guess and then try out your guess try it no that s too big just tried out 5 and she found out that 5 was too big now she s gone down to 3 and she s right 3 48
stop talking to her okay or come sit next to me good okay where s your pencil ma am okay so what we re dividing is you have to underline your quantity
so where are your quantities what s that the quantity is your amounts one stay on topic $5.44 and we know one is close to 16 ounces and we re looking price per pound so we re going to divide she had 4 you guys may go onto the next one
focus so we re dividing 16 into $5.44 now we just decided that we would try out some numbers initially teams of 5 here can 16 go into 5
16 why just do it
tree what is your measurement which one
so you need to borrow okay how many minutes are in an hour 60 so you re going to add 60 to this
50 ¢60 2 can go into 4 though 0 i m sorry okay 02 is right you add one
you have it right no what what s 63 times 24
4 ¢55 ¢6 is good 48 sit right there okay guys you have about 5 more minutes
accomplish i see lots of talking going on with and they re very much doing there s a backside to that page
work these gentlemen are spending way too much time talking and laughing there s also additional work in that folder
okay so this says area what we find with the rooms it says right here part of the way is a surface area area what s that s you don t have to worry about it
voice if you can t work in a group at the appropriate volume then you won t work in groups you ll work independently switch seats with you know you re not to sit next to
seats okay so what do you do now bring down the 0 the continue you guys okay
i know where to end up write how many times do you think it ll go onto something sometimes i can t seat no yeah try it
okay guys 2 minutes we have to be focused or we re not going to get it done
and you re going to say which one is the faster okay so you need to write 4 here correct you know how to divide and bring your decimal point up whoa what just happened with the volume in the
room okay ¢34 that s the answer ¢34 yeah yes that s exactly the same the only difference is you re bringing the decimal point up
yeah it always goes there the quotion always goes right there just a 2nd okay so i want you to try to on your own
you should have your blue folder carrying your work and you should have all right i m looking for a h a a and m
we need to be back where we should be what will you sit here thank you hold on i ll be right with you page 337 please it s 337
excuse me let me say this again
talking so in appropriate classroom voices everyone is speaking in a whisper because the folks in your group will hear you so let s go ahead and get started these folks here they re starting with a multiplication exercise time 4 minutes is on the timer you need to press start minutes as soon as i stop talking you may begin
side you have 4 minutes to fill out as much of the chart as you chart hopefully you ll finish it accuracy also too after that you re going to be moving to you guys can work on division and then when you re done with that you re going to go ahead and move onto area which is the next sheet
these folks over here you re working on oder of operations guys 123 go
over straight straight okay page 337 3 3 7
pricing different amounts of quantities with unlike units so things like miles and hours and price and ounces or pounds that s what we re looking at
for you want to know how much the price per pound say it how i asked you to say it the rate that we are looking for is how much okay so we re looking for price per ounce everybody say price per ounce price per ounce okay so 1st underline the quantities that you have
that you ve going to be working there 15 15 ounces and 337
what 15 360 divided by 15 yeah so let s start let s study that 3.60 divided by 15 all right can 15 go into 3 no 2 and let s try that one what s 2 times 15
30 okay so subtract is the next step remember we are doing a division problem what bring down the next digit bring down the next digit which is 0 can 15 go into 60 boys and girls yes yes how many times 3 if it can go into 32 times how many times do you think it can go in this 60
pencil focus it s not 3 it s 4 i was going to say 444 times 15 somebody work that out and tell me how much that is
top please no talking anything we re setting up problems and we re working but you re talking ad something that s not relevant let s wait for 4 so the answer is ¢24 per act
now you re going to underline the quantities of the next coven can i read it no that s not how it goes it goes right there you need your good paper
up when you re finished can i read it yes £20 of potatoes costs $7.40 what is the price per pound what s the rate we re looking for here pound per we are looking for price per pound thank you say it again the rate we are looking for is price per pound good so what are the quantities involved please have a seat please have a seat
ms s are we checking these or are you marking them you re checking them okay so let s go on and solve this so we set up the problem now we know that we re looking at £20 and $7.40
it it s 332468 10 12 20 40 follow along the table you can t keep adding adding it s going to take too long come on are you solving or are you just talking can 20 go into 7
no so if and is how many times what is 3 times 20 okay go ahead and go onto the next one underlying the quantities instead of the problem really yes
then what do you do how many times can 2 go into 147 so what will it be if you add those 30 hours back and 70 is yeah so 72 times
huh and then we add a 0 because this is 70 not 0 so what s the answer 37 ¢37 per okay we re working right now so excuse me
math okay number 3 a store sells a 4 pack of aa batteries for $20 i m sorry one of slice turkey and one palm is equal to read the whole thing one of sliced turkey costs $5.44 what is the price per pound huh huh per ounce okay one is 16 ounces so what other quantities are we looking at
16 divided by yeah and it s not by one you skipped a problem you skipped number 3 that s the only one that i was doing well you re getting ahead of yourself so let s go ahead and work on number 31st of all what is the rate we re looking for right here
map and the green math rotation please lower your voices no none how many can go into 64 how many times do you think
we re not going to do this hard one excuse me guys at the blue table loud put your bottoms in your seats and use your inside voices w no
remember the problem we had yesterday when we had to do 2 different parts parts it s a 4 pack so you want to know how much each battery costs so that s 2 separate problems underline your quantities 4 so you want to know how much each battery costs in the 4 pack
and how much each saturn costs in the 6 pack we need to find out both of those then you can pair them
pardon no
and i m going to be checking work from your blue folder before we proceed to recess so make sure you re doing what you need to do up did you get out of your seat without permission right because you need to go work with your group that s why you re in a group ladies and gentlemen you re working as a group so you re all responsible for getting it down .
isn t the 4 pack for the 60 and the 6 pack 55 so in the 4 pack they s ¢60 each and in the 6 pack they re ¢55 each which is a better deal
yes start underling work on one problem at a time
just one at a time okay now you don t have these 2 quantities we re not foreign stuff were okay both of them this and this and this and this
here there s not as much work to do you re working now is to help him along come on
okay for how many people so i can see what you re doing but you don t till march you have to multiply and get trash before september it s 55 it s 55 so which would you rather buy
no it s 60 and 55 okay would you rather pay ¢60 a bottom 60 right why the 6 pack is a better buy and you need to tell why
number it says which one is a better buy so you re going to say 6 pack or 4 pack that s your answer there s yeah miss s i did you do the math or are you relying on s paper i did not know my math so what is the cost of the 6 pack and the 6 pack they cost what together
no the 6 pack costs what the 6 pack cost $3.30 what s the price per battery in the 4 pack i m so sorry right so that is not a number it s words
erase it erase that sit down you re working with the group
if you can t work with a group then you re well you re sitting out of recess okay you guys are then why do some of you have it written down and others don t she was together
other so a 6 ounce cost $4.50
what is it okay by yourself you can t keep relying on that
you have to memories of them
i have to memorized because all right guess what it s gets harder if 5 s hard for you
because you re trying to add it don t make sense why you wrote it though i didn t write this one.50 a 14 ounce bag cost the same amount as the 6 ounce bag
how much does the 14 bags ounces cost 0 thanks so i going to take the 14th ounce bag how much per ounce the 6 ounce bag is so you need to divide duh i know that i need help on this
convert it into fractions but i don t know it
you need a 2nd row here how times can 4 go into 40
10 which means you didn t need to do this which means this is wrong no it s not this is a basic math 4 times what is 24
on no it s not 3 you shouldn t even have to set that up
because it s the basic math bringing in decimals and i m going to write her mom and tell her that she needs to make anything you participate in or do on the weekends contingent
alex alex we need t have a serious conversation what page is it 25 now multiply the cost per ounce by the number of ounces to find out how much 14 times
all right we have about 3 minutes remaining 3 minutes remaining down i m working with a group we ll do our final rotation when we return from lunch
w and at that time we will finish talking about this and do our wrapup lunch and what i need from all of you if for you to put your work into your folder i need you to tuck your work into your folder and when i call you up from the line i need you to present me with your completed work
okay so today guys our objective is seeing who will be able represent fractions on a number line by drawing out adding them objectifying their order to reasoning about equivalencies so what i m going to do 1st is model for you guys a couple of ways if i m trying to compare 2 things and trying to figure out where they go on a number line or where they would go in order
do so what a good mathematician will look at the denominator 1st because that s going to tell you how many parts to break it into s i can t see the board okay 5 okay so i break it into 5 5 how many do i shade in
4 right so i m going to shade in 4 and i m doing this so that i could compare the 2 fractions 5 fourths okay denominator the numerator tells us how many we shade in or the parts that we re talking about 4 all right and how many do i shade in
5 right so i m going to shade in 5 do you have to make a number or a 5
you have to make it make it up to 4 strategy open up your books to unit 6 page 35 please
board and i want you guys to practice as a group sure open up please open up please was taking open up to that s on the board my friend page 79 is 5
maybe what yeah 0 man okay question what s the of the 3 halves 3 halves good use words or pictures own use words and pictures yeah you guys can use words and pictures
think about what i just modeled for you and i ll institute you guys trying it we re on unit 6 and you need to do a better job of paying attention right now i need you to pay attention please you good
okay label them too as you guys are doing it and then one of you can get in front of the camera don t be nervous and you can share out your thoughts with your book book okay
you re explaining which one is larger through your drawing out because what we re going to do next is we re going to start to order them and we re going to find out hum some of them are the same
same some of them are have different numbers but they re really just the same okay all right i got a couple of student who you guys feel confident in coming up
up its okay if you don t want to bigger i don t know what i did i just did this i drew a picture and when i drew a picture my friends drew it 2 thirds when i did that i realized that there was only 2 parts shaded and when i shaded let me see
3 halves 3 halves so it was 2 well i don t care halves i knew that it was more than a half because this was only just 2 thirds so bigger which is bigger 3 halves or 2 thirds
know because it s more it s more than it s between a half it s between a half and it s between or 2 thirds is than a half yeah it s between no i shouldn t even so what would you put 2 thirds if you had to guess
half is it between a half and a whole is it between one whole what would you put 2 thirds it s okay just leave it through where would you guys put 3 halves on one of these waters cups of water whole more than a whole one half
c and one and a whole one and one whole here because why why because the it s just like one whole thank you it s one whole yeah it is a whole is it a whole and a half is so if it s a whole and a half do you think it s more than a whole or do you think it s just one whole more than it s more than a whole
okay it s just a little bit more because we still have to color in another half to get to 2 okay so what would you put 2 thirds it i d put it there good come up movie i d put it between the half and one
because why because it s not a half it s not one okay well do you think that this looks like a little bit more than a half to you middle so what you did is you drew 2 thirds
okay does that look like it s in the middle or does that look like it s a little bit more than the middle mark okay so then that s when it goes between a whole and a half
well they re both the same these 2 are both the same no i mean i don t the are the same 3 halves and 2 thirds aren t they re not the same because said that she would put it over here than more than a whole because what do you know i know that i have one of them yeah is one whole one of them is one whole good
and one of them is one half and one of them was one half so she s saying that 0 so like it s a whole and a half so it s more than whole okay sense yeah all right let s go to the next one page 39 page 39 please this is the one you guys are going to practice okay what you re going to notice is the equivalencies
word because i know equal equal because i see equal okay same same fractions different numbers and let me give you an example 37 37 you re going to see that drawing okay
know i know that 5 fifths equals a whole because if i draw out 5 pieces sense what else do you guys see there that you could put under a whole what s one thing that you could put under a whole you re coming too next
this one this one you put yeah what fraction could you put here are any of these fractions here one over one any 0 we could do 2 out of 2 yeah so
know like what you told us good okay and when we know that the denominators and the numerators are the same we can say that both of them equal one sense all right can you give me use your schemo for one half know which one of the fractions there on page 37 equals a half
12 6 out of 12 12 do you guys see how when the denominator the numerator is half of the denominator okay so these are rules that you guys can kind of come up with as you re doing it
the rules is something maybe you guys can think of when and we can come up with more as you guys are going along
when the numerator is half of the denominator the fractions or the fraction equals a half
okay all right so i m going to let you guys kind of explore through this a little bit the best thing i can suggest is use your math paper to figure out quickly 15th can you guys draw 15th and i ll go around and help you guys if you need help 15th can you draw it out please using your math paper paper your math paper or you can use this
okay 15th yeah 15th draw 15th and think about where would you put it if you had to put it in one of the cups and then you can write it down okay 15th and think to yourself as you guys are going along a good mathematician wants to think is it more than a half or less than a half
is 15th more than a half or less than a half when you look at that picture goes that would be more than a half right between the half and a whole does that look very close to being filled up in the cup
sense 15th when you guys look at this where do you think it goes does it look like it s filled up all the way to the cup to the top or does it look just like a little bit in the cup a little bit just a little bit so where does it go here here here or here sense so you re going to write 15th and then cross it out
good okay job does that look like it s filled up the whole cup or just a little bit of the cup no no so which one do you think it s going to go here here here here or here
okay all right so does anybody understand what they re doing today does everybody understand that you are placing it into the cups wherever you think it goes could somebody come up for a star please and explain to the class where does 15th go you give you a little head start and then you guys can begin
i m going to actually have you guys if you can work in groups because i think it works better that way unfortunately you 2 have to stay there please but i can pair you guys up it s not a problem because i think that way you guys will get more out of it
1st and last is one the fraction is 15th the fraction is one yourself and then i got taking one not halves and so we have to have less than a half to excellent job
today as you re doing it can you guys just do me a favor and cross off the fractions that you re doing would you mind working with today please it looks like you might have to work by your wait and either you 2 can work together or work by yourselves depends what do you guys want to do
together together is that okay or what i don t know you you work with please okay and i ll help out to the best of my ability
i think it would help you guys if you talked it the cameras can pick up your voices so if you re on task or off task it picks it all up okay if you need help are we supposed to if you need help and please feel free to work together
okay 5 out of 5 that s what do you think 5 out of 5 girls made wait 0 right there it s it doesn t matter right there which one do you think i know i looked and i didn t even i m looking and well which one do you think 5 this one
n if i if they re both the same what do you think it goes 500 you mean right there you went 5 5 505 where do you think 500 goes it also is the yeah what if you draw what if you drew it out what if we drew it out
me is it more than a whole or less i mean is it more than a half or less than a half more than half go sit down go sit down please thank you the 5 and a 5 so look look
5 see it s the less do you see how drawing out will help you morning does that makes sense how it all a whole n cross them out as you guys are going through
what do you think 14th goes well that is not what do you think 14th goes they go in less than a one half okay because 14th 0 my god these have a
you re right it needs 3 more to get to a 4th okay let s draw it out please that s true very good very smart
j that you need less than a half teacher 3 more to get to the whole good job one you re on your own these are the same now how many do we break it into what do we look at 1st break it into 5
all right what do we look at 1st the denominator yes so break it into yes go ahead
okay now you have to overlap now you you have to shade it 5 or you just going to shade it one or 5 do in the square yeah very smart very good okay now you can do it on your own well he might still need your help
yes stay with the denominator okay so what do you think okay so you got a more square one more square i d appreciate if you focused please so that s 4
do we have to do 5 yeah so where do you think we put that so that means it s going to get too confusing if you do on lines so put the fractions inside of the containers so i can see them
well just let me do this let me well let s start with the 1st one and let s work our way through 0 this is probably so this is where you need to draw 5 no it s fine
ones for the ones that are in the for the ones that you do next 4 and the math paper is there for you guys to draw it okay huh it s starting to get easy for you
student 5 out of 5 stop one and one half are 5 good so can you write 5 out of 5 there please okay
good so we re going to cross that one out because we re done with it and then the next one we get to draw out more out you can draw smaller if you want go and you re breaking them into how many pieces my friend excellent so now what a good mathematician thinks to themselves is is that more than a half or less than a half
less than a half exactly and it s all shaded okay do we just keep drawing let s do a hard one that one 2 yes 5 halves we break into 2s
ahead so there you shaded in one and there you shaded in 2 yes you stick with the denominator you keep making them in 2
job does that make it a little bit more sense now then 5 job there is 5 halves right there so that s one square okay so one 2 and a half 2 and a half good job 2 and a half where does 2 and a half go on there 2 and one half 2 and one half 2 and one half where does that go here
here where does 2 and a half go exactly is it starting to make more sense or yes like that or you can do it in 2 and one half
want you can do it as a mixed number or improper fraction i m all right now this one though where does that one go goes okay good i will correct it for you 2nd for that one good and that one goes good
and that one is 5 and one and 3 5 less than a half half yes yes okay can you help him please because it looks like you re getting this
good and be patient with him too patient you drew it out right bud
out which one is he doing 2 thirds i m doing 15th 0 15th 0 okay so she s asking you is it less than a half or more than a half it no less yes so where do you put it bud yeah so all really has to do is say is it more than a half or less than a half or is it more than a whole or less than a whole okay
well let him draw it out 1st see the only one you ve gotten wrong was that one but all the others were correct see please stay on task
good is this is the camera catching everything we do do everything it s very sensitive especially that means we should whisper 0 i don t know i mean it depends i don t know it depends but you understand that i got mine i yeah well if you if she got the looks like probably you have to
this is the only one that you got wrong because why if you had the same 0 so you put it 2 times do you see that no problem but you guys are doing well you could you draw that out please 2 fifths could you draw it out i wrote it right here good okay
is that more than a half or less than a half less than a half exactly it s less than a half
pictures as long as you guys keep practicing drawing out you guys will get in a good habit of exactly exactly you re doing 3 fifths right is that the one that you re doing 3 fifths wait wait wait wait let s try it again
go it kind of does look i agree with you it kind of looks like it but what do you think now now that it s less than one whole okay look look look i kind of agree that you thought it was a half i kind of agree but the thing is it s not quite it s not quite
3 i used circles so i could see it better half between 0 and one half so you think it s less than a half less let s pretend this is a pizza and you get 3 3 out of 5
now do you think that that s more than half or less than a half between one one half and one whole between one half and one whole because why because this is one half and it s all it has to be a whole if you just shaded in those 2 good that s a good explanation because you know that you only need 2 more pieces to get to 5 fifths okay so 3 would mean that s a little bit more than a half
right how may i help 20 he okay 0 yeah more than 0 very good
now if he getting these right most likely you re getting the same bit did you all well he he let me draw 5 halves right huh okay
can i see you draw out 6 fifths please 6 fifths yeah so you know what you guys want to start to think of saying class what is a rule that you could think of for about the halves 0 i kind of put it on well what do you think rule how do we know that these are equal to a half
how do we know we are yeah it s more very good and i agree fractions add the fraction sure that s excellent so does that look like more than a whole yes because this what do you know this is a whole right here yeah and so this means
be if it drew 2 of them and i had it go like right here it would be like it would be and there was more i would just might as well just put it in yeah very good excellent so what i was asking is can we think of a rule when we share out can we think of a rule that and something about adding fractions and i said tell me more tell me more about that adding fractions because i was trying to get him to think of a rule
what s a rule you could say 0 you know for a fact this is 10 twentieths equals a half rule because because we know that we know a half it s like one and 2 and 2 one yes so it looks like one half of 4 is 2
okay so and half the count okay so i want you guys to think like a rule that you guys can make up for me to share out good it s what you re saying it s exactly what you re saying but see maybe you can explain to right hum i don t know how we would call it with a rule with less one half
all right maybe if it s under a half maybe if it s under half yeah okay so maybe if we see are you saying maybe if you see one you know is you know that half of 4 is what 2 so if you know it s less than 2 then you know it s going to be less than a half
okay that s good yeah you have to wait until the movie is done 10 more minutes 10 more minutes okay good what i was trying to tell and what i was trying to tell the other group is can we think of a rule for less than one half
rule how do you guys know that 6 twelfths equals a half rule can we think of a rule for all of the fractions in the whole wide world that equal a half
rule yes something plus something equals a whole a whole part yeah so maybe something plus something equals a whole okay so maybe okay so maybe the okay okay good and then i wanted to think about a rule also for less than one half but we can share out right now
okay and i ll let you guys kind of figure these things out yourself friends for this part i wanted to come up with some rules that you guys can think of that can help you guys kind of articulate those and why don t you come over here please
rules if you had to think of a rule if you had to tell a 2nd grader or a 3rd grader hey there is a rule for finding out halves there is a little trick that you could use use if you know this scheme it will help you figure out a half can anybody here think again can you put that away please you can anybody think of a rule that you would tell to a 2nd grader or a 3rd grader probably a 3rd grader who is working on fractions
could you tell them a rule hey could you generalize hey this is a rule for finding out halves them does anybody have any ideas about what you would say i would say that i would like what s a half of a whole okay
example 2 fourths is a half okay this because 4 and it s like minusing it s like 4 take away 2 and it equals 2
rule if you minus if you minus the denominator i mean if you minus the numerator from the denominator you ll get the numerator you ll get the numerator again
different i haven t seen you and then maybe you can come up and do another one true okay see can i put them right here halves you re just coming up with halves that s it
fraction if is right you get a star bud put everything into halves we re just working in halves okay
bud i ve got the denominator i meant denominator by take away 3 no it s take away 6 from if i take away 3 from would you mind sitting this one out please would you mind sitting this one out please i took away 3 from 6 and it one that had 6 on it
works go sit down please okay job all right again sit down please it s not time to get up
denominator i m going to use s rule and i m going to minus it from the numerator okay can somebody tell me the subtraction go ahead it goes in one half okay
rule he s saying that if 100 take away 50 equals 50 job okay all right can we think of a rule and maybe you can kind of help out here half is there a rule for a less than a half
if you have 5 and the fraction is 16th we that s 6 and the fraction says 16th we should because it s not half because the half of 6 is 3 ah so what so he s saying that he knows half of 6 is 3 so the rule can be what
right okay hum i don t know how to write that exactly maybe you could help me out
6 out of 12 and that s half okay if you know half of the denominator and you shade in and you shade in less than right
half less and you shade less than whoops less than half of the denominator it goes where the fraction goes where in what category where does the fraction go
if you shade in half of the denominator so here is an example here is an example in if you know half of the denominator using your schemo what s half of 4
2 if you know half if you know half of the denominator is 2 and you shade less than half of the denominator less than so let s say i broke it into 4 and i shade less than 2 less than the 2 then you know the fraction goes where
half goes in the less than half category okay very good all right so those are 2 of the rules there is a rule for the whole does anybody know the rule for the wholes wholes that what would a rule be
how would you know that every fraction in the world should go there rule can you stop please it s distracting it here you re make ike that number that is like 5 out of 5 or 3 out of 3
rule because they re all the same number so it s a whole all together okay i m going to have to write down the one
what when we see 2 of the same numbers when we see 2 of the same numbers that means they are a whole in a fraction equals it equals a whole very good
true according to the rule when we see 2 of the same number in a fraction it equals a whole l yeah do you agree with the rule when you see 2 of the same numbers in a fraction it equals a whole good okay so the rule that came up with does apply to every single fraction
you guys came up with 3 rules today one for the halves one for the whole and one for less than 0 these are actually the same but i like yours better so i m going to get rid of this rule if we subtract from the denominator from the numerator it s actually say from the numerator if we subtract the numerator from the denominator okay
numerator so the numerator from the denominator and then we get and you get when we subtract the numerator from the denominator and you get the numerator again it equals half okay questions is there any questions about that
okay nice job guys 0 drawing out
this is very temperamental okay now it s recording yep okay boys and girls i want you to take out your math book and your classwork folder okay we re going to go into centers today i m going to go over the centers with you and then i m going to ask the groups at tables 3 and 6 to come to the back
today at tables one and 4 you re going to do a triangle sort so when you do the center i just want you to look in the bag there s already scissors and glue so you re going to have to share the glue here you re going to need to cut them out and then you re going to sort them and glue them onto a chart
sides make sure your add math is put away okay at tables 2 and 5 you re going to be working on quadrilaterals week so there s enough materials in here that you re going to work in pairs or groups of 3 okay
shapes if you happen to finish early there s 2 different things i want you to work on 1st teacher m is going to have a sheet for you called congruent coloring is what does congruent mean
though the same size and shape same size and shape where we talked about similar before or similar where they re the same shape but they may not be the same size congruent are same size and same shape so you re going to have this sheet and you re going to look to find 2 shapes that are congruent and then you ll color those shapes the same color
okay yeah the other thing you can work on if you re done with that is then you can go on the computers okay so people who normally started tables one and 4 go ahead to one and 4 5 people who normally started 3 and 6 go to tables 3 and 6
leave your classwork folder there and bring your math book to the back
yeah okay
today we re going to look at the shapes again but we re going to figure out before we talked about whether what kind of shapes these were we talked about guess my rule right where we tried to put a group of shapes together that had all the same attributes today we re going to work on identifying the angles the measurement of all the angles okay d do you know the measurement of one of the angles here 90 degrees you re right
it s 90 degrees right cause why do we know this is 90 degrees i don t know cause it s a right angle right here right so we know that this angle is 90 degrees but i want to find out the measurement of the other 2 angles
that i m going to give you some d shapes and you re going to work with the person sitting next to you to try and figure that out okay you 3 can work together okay you can use other shapes if you want to try and help you you re going to try and figure out the measurement of the other 2 angles and i ll give you a hint okay okay
these are it s what remember the hint was that this was 90 degrees right angles what can you use to help you
you the angle yeah you re going to use the shape somehow to help you measure the angle do who has yeah 60 degrees we re not making a guess right now we re trying to figure out what do you know about this triangle so far far this is a right angle right here right
measure 90 degrees 90 degrees how can we use our knowledge of that the measurement for that angle to help us figure out the other 2 angles do subtract that from well you could do that if you knew all 3 angle 2 of the 3 angles but right now you only know one angle what can you do with these shapes to help you figure out the other angle or the other angles
i didn t help you so i m not sure if it s what do you think and it seems like it s acute those other 2 angles do have to be acute you re right but then that means it can be any measurement less than 90 degrees so how are we going to get to an exact measurement do how can we use these shapes
one you could take 2 of the triangles and put one of em here like that and the other one is like that okay so you re going to use the right angle to try and help you measure all right and what do you notice what if you use 2 of em
did took the right angle cause he knows that s 90 degrees and he put the 2 angles over it do well what do they make
angle this is a right angle yeah let me show you let me see if it s easier for you to see it this way that yeah i got so now i m going to take 2 of shape d
this yeah and if i put them together do they make a right angle there the 2 of them equally come together to make a right angle equals right angle what does it equal what angle is this
0 yeah it equals 90 degrees so if you put the 2 of these together and it makes a 90 degree angle how does that help us what right angles no together 2 of them make a right angle
0 each one angles has to equal no boys and girls this angle equals 90 degrees right yes we know that that angle equals 90 degrees you took the 2 angles and put them together these 2 acute angles and what did they equal
90 degrees 90 degrees and they re the same each angle is the same measurement right cause they overlap completely you those 2 angles together add up to 90 degrees and if they re both the exact same amount then each one of them is going to be how much of 90 each there s 3 no
you put these 2 together to make 90 degrees so this angle plus this angle equals a right angle yeah which is 90 degrees so how much is each angle going to be worth out 45 very good
triangles when you use the power polygons we have this triangle d that we re trying to figure out the one thing we know is that this angle is a right angle it equals 90 degrees so we use 2 of them to help us right exactly so we know that the angles here and the angles here are the same right we traced triangle d here so we could use it to put our angles in
we put the angles in there and we realized that when we put them together they make a right angle and then said so basically each angle is half of 90 degrees right and so said 45 +45 equals 90 right so those 2 angles so we know that in this triangle one angle is 90 degrees one angle is 45 degrees and what s the other angle
45 right cause what are triangles add up to that so you re going to work together in pairs to kind of come up with the measurements for the angles
now i want to show you one other thing you could use to help you
do you see what i m doing i m drawing d
this is a straight line right do you know how many degrees this is 180 180 right so if i went all the way around how much would that be 180 360 right so when you make a straight line you make 180
360 you could use that if you tried drawing your shapes to see if they could make a straight line okay all right we re going to work together what i want you to do right now is open up your book please to page 17 remember unit 5 page 17
so what do you know 0 yeah all right so they want you to find the measures of these angles i m going to give you paper for your groups to use together
okay and we re going to have this bucket of power polygons for you guys to use and this bucket for you to use okay okay so what s the 1st shape that they want us to figure out the measurements for n so why don t you go ahead in your bucket and get shape n
it s a triangle it s a triangle that equilateral equilateral triangle very good
right yeah i think it s okay get more of those shapes
plate they got here use the shape just put some shapes out that ll help you find yeah they re probably right at the bottom that s not it it 0 i found n 0 i found f
yeah no we re focusing on n right now though that s what we need to focus on 0 i don t know where they are okay 0 i found one yeah all right so we re going to work together on this
quickly okay can i now i feel like we re just fooling around okay so how are you going to figure out the measurements of shape n it it s not that complicated here there s a whole bunch of them right here
i knew you were so how are we going to figure this out we have to figure out what each angle in that triangle measures how are you going to figure it out what are some strategies you could try to use are what do we know about an equilateral triangle
they re the same all the sides are equal and what else is equal the all all the angles right paper so if you tried tracing it right yep what did we just figure out using the other triangle
i don t know we can try using different angles to help us we could try putting the triangles together to help us figure things out we could also use making a line right do you want me to show you what i m talking about again all right let s look at these triangles if we put them together
make ooh i know what do we have right here a trapezoid you do have a trapezoid you re right but i m talking about what do we have right here a line a line
to 180 degrees yeah cause when we found these 4 triangles together right we had 45 +45 +45 +45
right so if i put if i can put these 3 triangles together and make a straight line what does that tell you about those 3 angles in the middle 180 what do they equal right there right and what did we say about an equilateral triangle all the angles are the
by 33 right so let s see so what s 180 divided by 3 think about 18 divided by 3 and then add a 0 to it 60 and does that is that right 60 +60 +60 equals 180 huh yeah right cause 6 12 18 and then we add a
0 so and what do we know about all the angles in an equilateral triangle all so that means every angle in that triangle is going to equal 60 degrees cause they have to add up to what
180 so in the triangle i want you to write 60 degrees in each angle all right do you have your pencil yes so no inside the triangle in each angle you re going to write 60 okay sorry yeah inside just show the measurement of each of those angles
and then how are we going to explain what we did in the space below it triangles you put them and we made a
did yeah huh agreed and then we know a line equals 180 degrees cause we figured that out with our other triangle 60 60 yeah and we know a shape ends an equilateral triangle right in this shape write 60 next to each angle inside it
thank you okay cause that s what we need to see i need to see the measurements and then i need to see your explanation okay
down as people are finishing i want the rest of you is there another shape on this page that you think it s easy to find the measurements of the angles easy because it has all right angles it has all right angles
so what s each measurement have what s the measurement of each angle going to be in so did you hear what that they said about c
c i see you think m do this one goes 0 you think it might be the same as shape d triangle yeah but it s not the same shape it is the same not the same size not the same size
what do we call them when we have 2 triangles that are the same shape but different size it starts with an s sim sim similar what do we call this shape when all the equilateral triangle all the sides and all the angles are the same
week we had a name for polygons that had all the same size and all the same angles regular regular shapes have all the same size and all the same angles all right so did you some of you on shape c you already wrote that it was 90 degrees some of you haven t done that yet so let s try to catch up
g in each angle you re going to label it
what altogether they equal 180 degrees 0 it s 360 180 and so far we know rectangles equal
360 is that the same with all we re going to figure that out good that s what you re working on right now right to figure out the angles on okay so go ahead and try and find some shape f s don t forget your explanations 1st shape c
f right it is a right triangle yep there i dropped it 0 brown is the next color it s very small
b yeah it s small and yeah so do you know any of the measures to the angles yet
so i know i know and what does that equal there yeah so write 90 degrees there so we all know we ve all agreed that that s a right angle right
angle and you could say i know one angle is a right angle which is 90 degrees so what s this measurement going to be
yeah so write it inside let s make sure on each of these we re following the same set of steps can they all equal 90 degrees they re not all right angles
0 we said we know that that angle is 90 degrees now does anyone think they know what the other 2 measures are do 45 +45 me show me that you know for sure that those 2 equal 45
45 i think they re 35 well rather than just guessing we have to figure out a way to show an exact measurement okay so you and need to work together how are you going to show me with some f pieces what the other measurement is
talk about that the 2 of you there the 3 of you put your pieces together you re working together know make a square well we know those 2 will add up to a line yeah
pieces so think about strategies we used with shape d you mean like that yeah and what did those 2 angles together just make 90 degrees like that a right angle right yeah 2 right angles so what does that tell you about each of those 0 when you overlap it right what do they make the 2 angles together
they make equal triangles listen to what i m saying q 90 degrees 90 degrees if you can put the 2 smaller angles over it what does that tell you
to if they ve covering a right angle they add up to 45 so explain what you did here 0 right and now you need to work together as a group to figure that out
with do you think it s the same as shape d okay show what you just did cause you re supposed to work together huh you know 1st say that you know this is what kind of an angle what 90 degrees and what and this is one half of 90 degrees just said
here put these 2 angles together and they equal what 90 degrees hold on this those 2 angles together equal 90 degrees 90 degrees so what does that tell you about each angle how much is each angle going to be
45 degrees cause they both the 2 of them put together equal 90 degrees right so put 45 and 45 did you guys figure anything out yet out yeah i was doing it wrong at 1st so then i saw what did so then i think what is that going to do
so then i put the 2 shapes together and i saw that it was a square and all sides are equal so huh i don t know all right angles so all of it is 90 degrees if you cut the 90 degrees in half you get 45 good so write that down 45 and 45 and then you re going to explain that okay
and one more time just as a reminder what does a triangle s angles have to equal to one no good so you know if you added up your angles and they equal 200 would you have an accurate angles no
m is all right so you don t have your explanation here you need to finish your explanation
we re not going to have time to finish but i want to look at shape l for a minute now do you know anything about shape l already just looking at it me does everyone agree with that this is a right angle
so what do we know that s going to measure you re cheating so put 90 degrees in that angle it if you look at f and d they have 2 sides that are the same
triangle equal they re right same eyes isosceles isosceles are any of the sides on this shape the same triangle isosceles none of the sides are the same scalene scalene yeah we need to work on this vocabulary
so tomorrow we re going to come back and we re going to work on this again we re going to pick up with shape l okay right now i just want you to take a look at your work that you ve done so far and make sure all of your explanations are there and make sure all the angle measurements you ve figured out are written in there okay do me a favor i m not going to make you put the shapes back in the bucket but i want you to put them on the plate
so if you have any shapes out i want you to put those on the plate okay all right people in centers you need to clean up do we keep out the ones yeah you can hold to that 123 people at tables one and 4 and 2 and 5 you need to clean up so unfinished work i am talking you are listening
yeah if you re not done with your work where is it supposed to go folder and now we need all the materials back in the bags 5 we need to make sure the cards get placed in the bag lost when you guys leave this table you re going to go to tables one and 4
up huh go ahead okay just make sure all the shapes we have a lot of shapes that are out
parallelogram a polygon that has 2 pairs of parallel sides right sides can a parallelogram be a rhombus they re the same no not because the parallelogram has no doesn t have all sides right and the rhombus does right
so that s good that you re beginning to be able to differentiate between all those and figure out the differences so it s not as complicated for you anymore guys table 5 we re waiting for you because right now we re not putting things down around where is the bag where all the materials belong what where are the green shapes
put those in the bag please it seems like every time i agree on all the geometry notes like the thing i mainly look at is mainly why i remember you people at tables one and table 4 table one to table 2 here table 4 to table 5
here this stuff is yeah and of them move up
you really need to just sit down so you can get by i know move over a little bit
p okay can you grab the chair behind you so can sit next to you okay okay
do you remember last week we worked on we worked with these shapes the power polygons okay one of the things we talked about was we did things like guess my rule where we put shapes together and tried to figure out why they were together today what we re going to do is we re going to try and figure out the measurements of the angles in a shape okay power so the 1st shape we re going to work with is shape d okay
does anyone think they know one of the measurements of one of the angles 90 degrees where do you think there s a 90 degree angle here this angle right here is what kind of right angle a right angle
and we know that a right angle equals 90 degrees 90 degrees so i m going to trace this on here for when you work in your book you re going to have these shapes
d and we know that this shape this angle is 90 degrees okay yes okay angles what i want you to do right now we re going to work there s 2 acute angles we re going to you think it they are 2 acute angles but that means that they re just we just know they re less than 90 degrees 0 we have to find it okay we have to find out the exact measurement
70 degrees well you are going to work with right now to try and figure something out idea yeah yes you should know that on a triangle all of its add up to 180 degrees so that one if the right angle adds up to 90 degrees the other 2 need to add up to 90 degrees also very good
so knows that the angles in a triangle equal 180 degrees so he said that 180 -90 wait a minute he said that the other 2 angles have to add up to 90 degrees some of you think it might be 45
together and you ll work together and you ll work together and then and you ll work together okay so right now i want you to figure out a way to show me what the other 2 angles equal so go ahead take your shapes i always put them in well you can work together
out that i could put 2 right angles to find that half of 90 okay so right but do you know the measure of that angle no what do you know about either that s fine if you want to use a square to help you or if you want to use this equals 90 degrees you know this equals 90 degrees what did you just figure out
that s half of a right angle right there that s half of a right so it s half of a right angle so that means right so that means half of 90 degrees very good about you could also use these together right yeah so talk that over now how is that helping you to see if there s certain so that we can there s one well how can you figure out they re the same
by doing that yeah they overlap right so they re the same so so now that you know they re the same how are you going to figure out how much they measure we re going to go we re going to go like that you re on the right track but that s not really but how are you going to get a measurement from that
because if they re the same you have to assign 2 numbers that then we re going to take this off but do you see it s not really working the way you planned it do take these off and go like this but do you see how you re having trouble squeezing it together and having it stay right nuh very you could use this to help you
em take it out take it out okay now what now you have to put this side in right all right so that but now we need to come up with the measurements what does this equal right here 90 i know what to do
me this is 90 degrees right degrees and then you said it s 90 degrees going to put this angle into there huh and then here and then match here s one on the table that s half of it
huh so so what are you could put another one this one right here put it flat on the table it makes it easier okay it s a irregular one so it s still quadrilateral so
that s a irregular polygon so you know that they equal what
it 45 degrees 45 degrees where are they lessons okay so they equal 45 degrees someone tell me their strategy of how their group figured it out l we put these together huh and we noticed that 2 of them equals one right angle so that means one of them would be just half so half of 90 degrees is 45
good you did the same kind of thing right i don t know we went like that and then that s okay you overlapped it did they overlapped it over the angle they knew the 90 degree angle how did you guys figure it out you did the same thing this group used a square to help them so they cause a square has all what
angles so they put one triangle and then they put the other triangle and that equals 90 degrees so when i label these other 2 angles i should put what in each angle
45 45 degrees there s one other strategy i m going to show you with the triangles i want you to stop and listen to what i m look at what i m doing so everyone needs to concentrate
meet a one is a vertex yep vertices so so far that equals how much
0 is there such a thing as an 89 degree angle there could be
it probably wouldn t be on a triangle cause you d only have one degree left for the other angle 89 degree angle like this what was i able to make with these 4 acute angles right here a right angle well these 2 make a right angle
here an obtuse angle it is an obtuse angle cause it s more than 90 degrees but look at what i made right here 0 a straight line a straight line
to 180 degrees 180 degrees so if i was able to put the 4 acute angles around and it made a 180 degree angle i could take the 180 divide it by 4 and i would know that each angle equals 45 that huh so you could use you could try putting the shapes together to make a straight line cause you know that measurement right okay
the other thing you could do is you could make a whole circle right if i kept going and i went all the way around what would my measurement be 360 so you could draw the shapes around a common vertex and then divide by that amount saying huh all right let s open up your book to page 17 so unit 5 page 17
do like this shape d i put the angle measurements in there so you d need to do that and then you d need to write an explanation ns so now you 2 will work together that triangle has no the triangle has no right angle you re right so we re going to have to use a different strategy to figure it out
do you have any idea what kind of triangle that is triangle one that has all sides and all angles angles are the same right all the sides and all the angles angles are the same
here s some more okay you got to take your yeah what i was thinking of was to take like in remember what s one of the things we tried making
pieces okay compared as to that and that s like it s more than yeah so if it s i think it s more than 90 degrees can you make a straight line yes how many angles did it take
what then 90 degrees what does a straight line equal equal all the time if it s more than it is an obtuse angle but the measurement 180 and you have 3 angles that came together to make that
by 3 yeah use some paper
so i understand for 2 angles 1234 here try tracing it well that s got it
remember we tried well trace what did you just make when you made that well we re trying to what did you make right here
to a straight line is equal to 180 degrees okay and how many angles did it take to make that straight line 60 good 18 divided by 3
a what are you doing you just said do 180 divided by 3 60 okay all right remember it s not percent it s degrees i didn t say it wasn t 0
well i didn t even know you know what else i ve been hold on up with shape n when you re labeling the angles you write inside each angle the measurement
but where are you getting those numbers from i don t know all the angles have to be the same that it says no let s take a look at something that and did okay and also this group did it as well and and and put their triangles together and they made a straight line
before huh what is a straight line equal to line 180 degrees 180 degrees how many angles came together to make 180 degrees 33 right and we know that all these angles we said this is an equilateral triangle we divided by 180
equal think 18 divided by 3 and add a 0 what s 18 3 times wait a minute relax 180 divided by 3
is it s 5 okay you need to stop now we re taking 180 25 and a half stop 0 okay no 3 i do know so good i do know 3 times what is 18 60 but 18 divided by 3 is 6
huh 6 yeah and then you add a 0 we got another 0 so the answer is 60 so each of the angles are 60 degrees zeros all right i m not trying nothing okay so what did we just say
what are each of the angle we need to stop and focus cause people i understand that and are done but you still need to listen to what other people are doing and you re just playing with shapes doing so what is each angle going to measure 60 degrees 60 degrees so inside the triangle in each angle write 60 i didn t and you solved and you still haven t done it
on your paper and now you need to explain what you did
let s try writing the explanation together cause i think that some of us are still having trouble
we re not looking at the shapes right now we re doing the response pencils stop and listen this could very well be on your next test mcas it s not enough just to find the answer you have to be able to explain what you did
do they combined the triangles to make to make straight lines yeah so you could say we put 3 shape ends together to make what
say a straight line and what is a straight line l what s the measurement for a straight line
180 yeah and what could we say 180 divided by 3 equals
60 60 right and then we probably need to say something else triangle equilateral so shape n is equilateral so all of the angles will be
60 degrees do you see that the reason i just stopped for a minute and i still feel like you re not fully focused this isn t easy when you re doing it the 1st time it ll become easy with more practice and the more you learn about the shapes
that s why we re doing all the different things we re doing in the centers right measure and now we re talking about angles inside polygons and it may seem challenging but you have to stick with it listening it s important we use the different strategies and work together to figure it out
that just to be clear that if you re done writing your explanation does anyone see another shape that s easy to identify the angles inside the shape 4 you think c is easy
easy because well what do you what s the measure of the angles do you know okay so inside shape c put 90 degrees in each angle
say i know that all of the angles in shape c are right angles right angles it huh don t doubt yourself time we re going to be switching in 2 minutes
up 0 yeah boys and girls i should start to see shapes going back into bags glue sticks being put away
and when you get back help them clean up please
our contents standard says predict the probability of outcomes of simple experiments and test the predictions so i thought what we would do today was to do some really easy start with an easy example and then move on probably by the way has to do with taking a chance
probability it doesn t mean they re going to win but they just take a chance when they pay the money to buy a ticket so our essential question is why should probability be tested there are some words that i want you to be familiar with because they come up and you will see them within questions that you are given or maybe just questions that i just happen to ask you
probability most likely least likely best chance most often and then the word fraction because sometimes within our answers they also are given in the form of a fraction no our objectives for today you are going to provide outcomes from experiments with a spinner
myself it s pretty okay so i m going to put it here so you ll be able to see it in just a few minutes 2nd objective is you re going to test your predictions with color pieces through simple experiments are they re called flying saucers but we re going to use them in our testing today
and you re going to create your own sweet smarty math problems that you may not eat anything that we work with today goods alright questions so far no i better be joking what no i m not joking i m going to pull these 2 desks back so i can ah
okay now this is missus whee alright the spinner has some colors on it that yes and with the spinner having colors on it i tried to color code them so it would make it kind of simple it is a spinner that s broken into or divided into how many selections
slices 9 10 okay and your job when it is going to be spun you need to be able to answer some questions what i would like for you to do is to answer those questions after studying the chart as well as what it s asking you for
alright if we took a chance alright if we took a chance and the spinner is spun question number one if we spin the wheel and the arrow see my cute little arrow the arrow lands on purple what is the chance that the arrow will land on purple
remember your answers are give me the opportunity to hear that you understand what the answers will be in the form let s see what you come up with okay the chance that the arrow lands on purple you studied the wheel real well purple one out of 9 i mean one out of 10
10 because there s only one box that says purple and there s 10 other triangles that have different colors in it alright number 2 if we spin the wheel and i m just spinning it because we really don t know what it s going to land on right
minutes number 2 if we spun the wheel if we spin the wheel the arrow lands on blue my if it lands on blue 10 good girl 4 out of 10 yes
m because there s only 4 kinds of blue and the rest of them are different colors good colors number 3 if we spin the wheel and the arrow lands on berry if we spin the wheel and the arrow lands on berry what would our answer be
10 3 out of 10 why because there s only 3 berries and the rest are other colors 3 is on berry 3 of berry and the rest are different colors good number 4 if we spin the wheel and the arrow lands on green
why because there are just 2 greens 2 triangles of green and the rest of the colors are different colors good now let me move this i want to flip i won t do it
okay moving on to the next part of the lesson make sure you state that you remain familiar with our vocabulary see probability probability
fraction now which of those did you use with the spinner
yes i didn t even think about that but i thought that would be a good question just for me to ask you as a part of kind of closing out what we did for the 1st exercise the next one we re going to do i want us to be able to test some predictions with some color pieces better known as flying saucers and i put them here
it keep passing take and pass middle stop with and so everybody has one ms s has the rest of them in the middle right okay
alright they have little candy on the inside but you re not going to eat it that what is the probability and that means you re going to have to let everybody see what s in your hands i m just going to pick a color at random cause i do not know what you have as opposed to what i have which is a good way of testing this out
what s the probability that there are more white than any other color see what s the probability that there are more white than there are any other color white 0 the other pieces including the teacher s
many 1st of all how many participants are here 10 10 of us are holding up a flying saucer yes so that would definitely be in a fraction will the 10 be the numerator or the denominator the denominator the denominator where s the denominator located in a fraction
good why do we talk about what s the purpose of a denominator what does the denominator do in a math problem okay now that we have ascertained that the denominator is 10 i ll go back to my question with you again
what is the probability of there being more white saucers than anything else one what about the color blue
blue what is the fraction or what is the likelihood that there are we want to find out what is the probability of blue saucers among the rest of them right 0 i guess you want to shake it a little bit
okay so what is the answer for the blue saucers a because there is only 3 blue saucers and the rest are different okay very good what is our fraction now if we re i m not going to hold anything up
not what about and i m using i m just holding up the peach colored one
color what is the probability that the peach color can outrank the rest as far as amount
pink are there is it more likely that there are pink saucers or let me compare pink saucers to blue saucers so that means you got to hold everything up so everybody can see pink saucers to blue saucers hold them up
up alright is it more likely that there are more pink saucers or less likely and we re comparing pink saucers to blue to blue saucers is it more likely or least likely that there are more pink saucers
why because 2 people have blue saucers blue flying saucers and the other 2 have 2 flying saucers so is it more or less 0 less no it s not less g i think it is equal it s equal and i did not throw the word equal out there
equal because 2 people have the pink saucers and 2 people has the blue flying saucers okay fraction give me the fraction of pink saucers everybody hold up again
what s the fraction of the pink saucers to the whole you no 2 ninths 2 of the good 2 ninths and then what about a fraction for the blue saucers
saucers 3 ninths 3 ninths hold them up so we can verify on pass them back around you can just leave them at your desk for a few minutes i ll get them shortly
okay in my hand is a bag of flying saucers and my 1st question is how many flying saucers and one minute i think i can make it work this way
how many flying saucers do you see altogether
okay and i m going to do the same thing that you all did 12 and did you notice they weren t all the same color right so here is my 1st question for you i want to know what is the order and i have 3 cards that have the question on it
part now you need to give it to me in order from the least likely what is the least like to most likely that these colors are pulled less small small small alright what about most greater greater greater or large large alright so what i want you to do is to give it to me from least likely which means the smallest to most likely which is the largest
if it s least likely which color would be pulled 1st which color would be pulled 1st if we re talking from least likely to most likely the white the white let me pull okay anything else
the blues blues okay here 2 okay now says pink will be the next one in line
peach how many peach 55 okay okay excuse me for that interruption on now here we go with this one
one in here we have 5 pink saucers we have 2 blue saucers you want this write this down
now on the saucers you have 5 pink ones you have 2 blue ones there are 4 white ones and there are 3 peach ones
5 pink 2 blue 4 white 3 peach is that what i gave you yes what s the total number of saucers are there so far 14 you sure
flat one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 how beautiful is that alright if a saucer is picked out of this bag what is the probability that it will be a pink one
head what i want you to do what is the likely number then i m going to ask the question a different way what s the likely what is likely the saucer that will pick likely pink likely and what s the chance chance the probability that she what color do you think she ll pick
pink pink white the blue pink pink i say the white pink or white pink i say white i say white alright i m covering your eyes here s the bag i say white i say white i say white white white white yes yes okay 0 white she chose white now that s a probability
so if that s the case what fraction did pull to prove that she chose she pulled a white one out of this bag 14 in most cases what will we think would have been pulled
more there are more pink than any other color but in this case and that s why we re testing it because in this particular case it didn t turn out that way did it okay alright we re going to give you a chance oops what color do we think that may pull pink pink no peach i mean we really don t know but we re going to see
it okay cover your eyes white blue blue he chose blue more now this one is kind of interesting
in this particular bag i have selected to put some colors kind of obvious almost alright and there are how many are 88 blue down and what s the other color you see
2 white white 2 white okay okay what is the probability that a blue saucer could be pulled out of this bag
j i m trying to mix it up real good over here see blue blue blue did he pull blue yes yes why was he able to pull blue because there was more blue there are more blue and the probability is that most likely that s most likely likely questions so far no
alright this is the last thing we re going to do
alright i want you to write give me would you write just one question for us please come up with some type of a question or develop if you would a question of your choice you can print it out okay alright share we only have about 4 minutes left for this lesson
what kind of math problem can you devise with your smartie sir we do not have to put how many colors are there what kind of lesson can you what kind of math question can you develop based on what is in front of you 0 okay nobody s is going to be the same cause the color already pointed it out for us
everybody s they are not identical the only thing that s identical with everybody s what do you think they are smarties they re smarties they re smarties there s something else they re sweet that s the same for everybody they re sweet they all are the same colors they ve got the same they got no they are not all the same colors wrapper mathematically speaking mathematically speaking
okay so having said that now you have 2 minutes i would like for you to just write one question please that you re able to develop from looking at what your smartie wrapper has just one question
and you have some of these words here that you can use some of our vocabulary that you can use to help formulate your question we can don t open it
it keep them wrapped cause we re going to put them back in the bag time okay no us i want i said i wanted to hear from it just about a couple of people
thing but we want to go back and determine why should probability be tested so tell us 1st of all how many smarties are in your wrapper 15 check your wrappers to see how many smarties you all have
also so that is one thing that we all have in common is that not that we all have 15 smarties in our wrappers okay what kind of question did you develop with yours what was the probability of pulling out a light green a light green alright how many light greens do you have in your pack s how many greens does have in his package
33 so what s the probability that a green will be pulled out of that package 3 out of 15
theory are there any others who would like to provide their sample before we end our lesson today 1st if we were to open from the top and bottom what would come out what most likely would the most be to come out what do you mean the most be bottom it has 2 colors it has colors
based on the 1st 2 on each set what would mostly come out out like okay pass it to go ahead he s trying to say like keep going
if you pull like from this side and this side and you pull it out what s the most likely colors would you get because there s one green one pink and there s 2 whites so the answer will be white 2 out of 15 will be white 2 out of 15 is that what you have good okay okay
okay any questions so far about probability question predict the probability of outcomes and this is the objective 1st predict the probability of outcomes of simple experiments and test the predictions
have and how successful did you find yourself to be in solving at least 80% of the questions that were raised yes what about here s our central question again
so we realize that probability is taking a chance it s taking a chance and when we had when i covered s eyes and s eyes and s eyes how many times were we right about our answers once i remember one i remember with s we were right about what we guessed somebody was right about mine cause they said white and i said white okay
so that means we all had some of us had a different opinion that other people based on the answers as well correct yes okay so we realize that probability is taking a chance it is taking a chance but what you re going to have to do is to pay very close attention to what is presented to you in order to formulate the right answers last but not least i m going to give you an assessment based on what we have talked about this morning okay
so i m going to give this to you and i will collect the different materials from you but have your paper ready
go to the bathroom go to the bathroom and you do wait until he come back
13th for part 2 a b comparing fractions and being able to identify equivalent fractions give me vocabulary that we use with fractions
vocabulary fractions okay you said fraction yes nominator denominator you should be writing this down yes
numerator numerator yes equivalent okay so we say equivalent and what does that mean when we say something is equivalent that it equals the same thing okay so the value is equal
yes what fraction unit fraction yes compare okay compare when we say compare what symbols do we use to compare
yesterday what are some symbols that we use to compare numbers yes okay so we use less than greater than greater than and equal than and equal well we re not worried about so much equal when we re talking about equivalent fractions are there any other vocabulary words that are associated with fractions
yes one whole huh one whole okay didn t you say a whole number okay now let s look at the piece of paper that s on your desk
i m going to take out your fraction bars and i want you to set up your fraction bars please do not close your notebook i didn t tell you to close your notebook set it up
floor set it up up huh no talking no talking
you just go ahead and set it up
i ll give it to you
what s another strategy that we can use to find equivalent fractions
hand okay it shouldn t take you all too long to set it up
now that s all we did yesterday thank you okay so fraction with a fraction what does that mean mean fraction okay
no ma am i mean part of a whole number so a fraction means part of a whole now we know the denominator represents what the . the . larger the larger no
how many how many equal parts so if i have 3 sixths how many equal parts do i have 66 and what part of the of the whole is a unit 3 so we have 3 units
that 16th +16th +16th equals +16th +16th +16th so we say equals 13 yeah one
23 sixths but if i add 123456 and i have 6 sixths that s equal what one whole one whole well let s do this little activity i need you to finish setting it up up okay you should have written what i have hurry up
up yeah get your paper because you ve got to use this paper so you need to find a way paper yes ma am i m sorry but your mama sent you to school so i mean what . what s teacher e going to do
there did i give you a notebook this is not it s not urgent it s not that urgent just raise your hand like everybody else and tell me what you need
out okay so let me give the directions on what you re going to do today thank you i m going to send you out i m going to send you out of here and what is all on camera
it s all on camera sit down fold your paper into 4 sections parts 4 equal parts
like this now at the top of your paper write your name
date write your name today s date and then write what you re doing 4.2 a b we re talking about comparing fractions and we re talking about equivalent fractions fractions
front 4.2 a b
you re taking too long okay let s look at our die
it s something that we did yesterday for a few minutes when you came to me at the table and i want to repeat it to make sure you all understand about comparing fractions
you okay now on one of the spaces i want you to write comparing fractions in your 1st space theirs just write it in the little box fractions in your 1st square or your 1st area write comparing fractions
what you re going to do now with your die who s there you re going to take your die like we did yesterday and you re going to roll it remember i don t want 22 . or 33 as a whole number that i want you i want this number let s do that if you do get 22 we know that represents what
a whole one whole a whole number so we re going to use that today so you re going to roll it and then you re going to write the fraction and space them out because what are you going to what symbols are you going to compare them with less than or greater than or
than i m going to give you a 5 minute so i m going to give you 5 minutes
square at least give me 33 problems around you re writing too big because you got to put the problems in this . in this square
0 we got to write our problems i m not going to explain anymore i ve done that i ve explained it if you can t sit there and listen and follow directions i can t help you do yes ma am is this come on
out how many should you have 33 at least so you re going to roll once fraction and then in between them you re going to tell me whether that number or that fraction is greater than or less than the fractions
yesterday okay what did i say about one about the whole numbers today come up come up here come up here because you can do at least 3 so the 1st one you re going to do put number one there if you roll your dice
one if i get 3 sixths the next one i get 2 thirds the next one i get 5 sixths okay one then number 2 in that 1st area i want to see some people are working . some people are working good
but you can use your fraction bars in order to give you a visual of what it is
good teacher h like i yeah this is greater and this is i can see it in okay okay make sure that you have space
here number one and then write it up here then 2 then 3 okay so that s not equal is it no it s not equal okay so is it greater than or less than greater you re talking instead of working
comparing greater than or less than yes or equal we re using if you have to but you re not going to have the same fraction that s you re not going to have the same fraction 0 if you have the same fraction in that equation erase it and roll again today 0 because i had 22 and 44 so no
fourths did you check it by using the fraction bars yes okay i thought that teacher e i have 2 fourths and then 4 sixths i have 4 fifths and i have that s fine you okay
fractions i know but then when i spinned again i if you get the same ones then spin then roll it again 0 number it 123 numbers 3 no we do something else give me what no where s your pencil right here i want . i want 3 like this yes
can we do 4 if we already did 3 no
floor i don t have any more of those sit
listen when you roll it i did something wrong you didn t put your name on it so you didn t put your name if all we had was to put another number right here all you re going to do is you have comparing fractions number one
once that s tw sixths 0 again i got 2 sixths again i don t want 2 sixths oop who was that why you don t have to make that noise this is not pre k
p okay then you got 3 fifths then you roll again 0 i then you got 4 fifths then you look at your fraction bar again 3 sixths 0 i did something wrong huh did i do this right i ll check it later
i need to make sure everybody is no number 3 erase that that should be up here erase that no it you re not following directions problem teacher e can you check mine i m not checking them right now
make sure you got your 3 okay okay teacher e where s your 3 hurry up and decide which is greater than or less than
teacher e i got 5 fifths and then 6 now right beside it on the othwer side you re going to draw it
line i have 01 then i have 2 well i know this right here represent what one whole so in between i have one
123456 so i have 1234566 but i only have how many shaded 333 so this represents what 33 sixths 3 sixths my next one is what
2 thirds 2 thirds i m going to use another color so you can see explaining modeling okay so now i have what 22 thirds thirds thirds am i all the way to my . my whole number
no no so then i know this is not greater than 5 what s all that what s all that i don t know on that blue one
oop that s going to wipe it up i don t want to use 123 now i have 3212
no so which is greater at this .2 thirds 2 thirds now i m back to 123456 do you all see that yes and i have i m going to do it in i got to do it in another color
so which is closer which is greater now one whole wait 2 . 5 sixths 2 thirds 5 sixths wait because i m close to what
0 so . 3 sixths is actually what greater than less than 2 thirds 0 and 2 thirds is
less than greater than no less than is less than 55 sixths because on the number line it s on the grid then it would get as close as you can to one whole
see you guys are able to read that number line as well as seeing it drawn and also using your symbols here i want you to draw your fractions
block okay so i draw that s good the 1st one fit it in the 2nd what it feels like i have to vomit because i know you don t but go on
can i go my mom said she was going to call back and the nurse said she was going to bring down my when they call you yes okay so i want you in the next on in the next area i want you to draw the comparing fractions so you have to just like i did . just like i did here
bars so you want they re all equal to what one whole one whole that was so you want us to draw a picture from these problems yes sir yes ma am now can yes what you need then why you copying it off of me
fractions it s what i did up there you will do for each one to show okay okay yes so you need to just okay you going to try using a number line okay let me see how good you are
you didn t finish 2 and 3 because i didn t know you do the same thing that i did up here but you didn t put your greater than or less than signs here teacher e yes ma am can i what you need . i don t understand your paper because you didn t put your name on there 1st
objective i need an eraser i don t have any more erasers i just said i don t have any more erasers to give i don t have any more why stop talking
you got 2 more to go don t so don t draw so big even if you got you got 3 sixths excuse me 2 fourths 16th you still got to make that 4 even with the 6 just like the fraction bars here
okay what s wrong i don t understand you got to put another fraction here where s your where are your 3rd fractions you got a piece on the floor are you too you re too close to the edge you got one on the floor 112th okay why do you all keep calling me why why do you keep calling me like that raise your hand
2 fourths is greater than 6th what do you need do you want us to draw the dominator how many blocks and then just no no no no bars like i did here
even though this was a 3rd i still made it even so you can see it and compare this this might be 4 this might be 8 this might be 12 how how am i going to tell to compare them
0 i see for example is that a 5 or a 52 baby make it look like a 5 you got to roll one more time and put 3 more equations on the end and compare them like you did with the 1st 2
dice this time i got 2 fourths rolled it again
i got one half i m going to roll it again and i got 2 thirds wow it my 1st one is 24th next part is one half
next one is . 2 thirds should look like that bars yes
get your things and stack your chair why your hand up
you already been to the restroom if i m not mistaken when we finished with the video you went the restroom didn t you okay so we got 2 fourths 0 this is not even any good
i what you need i don t know what you re doing that s wrong 2 then one half 2 thirds okay so 2 fourths and one half is what
equals huh one half to 23rd is what
sets excellent excellent that s wrong doing we re not doing we don t multiply fractions multiplying no that i did it is wrong because it s not what i m teaching i m teaching comparing fractions
doing it s wrong i m not even doing that
it s wrong did you finish yours that was like this yeah yay i have up here i have 3 fractions represented
this what s that okay that is 14th 14th okay so i have 2 fourths now i m going to show one half since you want to go that way
one half 2 thirds okay where . where am i . where am i going to put 13rd where s the 3rd going to go
i don t know see you re not following directions i guess you did i did 6 because if you got 66s you got all 6
no so i made it like this and this is greater than that and this is greater so where s your one half if you got 2 thirds so where s 2 thirds for number 2 where s 23rd right here 2 thirds is right here here there s 2 thirds so 2 thirds 3 sixths 123456 now you had one half that should be here okay
as long as you can justify it and i can read it because i m going to grade it this is so hard for some of you all to actually draw a visual of what you see
i know another way you can show it i don t want to e okay now okay nobody has to go you re all interrupting my lesson
down the camera is going i don t . i don t know what else to say i m not going to be the one i can review it no i need to do one more problem teacher e
i . i m not going to i m not going to keep re hashing and keep saying the same directions over and over again because some students moving too slow yep okay then you roll it again what 2 fifths now tell me which one is greater than or less than what i just did on the board
excuse me it says that . on my paper it says that 3 fifths is that when i drew it they re equal but when i no it s not equal way these should never be as you could look right here you see they re not the same
yeah i was saying that okay 3 fifths divide it into 5 equal parts 03 yes okay now let s go to equivalent fractions some of you all are just going to be behind because you re not sit down baby
yesterday rolled the die than and i asked you you can use your fraction bars to help you then i wanted you to draw a picture for me okay so now let s talk about equivalent fractions
yes fractions that are whole that are what no okay fractions that so roll your die die okay somebody got 3 fifths you have what
2 fifths 2 fifths you placed it like that yeah when i did okay 2 sixths you got 6 sixths 2 thirds me i got 5 ninths okay so in your group . 22s roll it
have no it was 3 fourths i thought you said the 3 the highest one goes to the model yeah wrong we haven t got to improper fractions yet fourths but we will okay that s 5 sixths girl 0 yes what did you thought it was
i thought it was a 9 no i told you yesterday okay so okay comparing so we have 4 fifths what the next one m 2 sixths no roll the dice 0
now let s look at these i want to we ll come back to equivalent fractions so we still with comparing fractions but now we going to put them in order from least to now from least to greatest how are we going to determine that
chart with this chart okay so you can use your fraction bars can we use this since you have that can we use this and what is this 0 wait never mind never mind never mind okay we re going to do this together
if i have 4 fifths look at your fraction bars and you re going to tell me which one is least it excuse me
least yes . 14th okay look at your fractions you all are not looking at your fraction bars 15th huh huh you re not looking at your fraction bars
t well you got 3 fifths 2 times yeah 3 fifths no 15th and 3 thirds it s 3 fifths and 3 fifths 15th one half there we go 5 fifths 2 fifths
h 4 fifths okay now look at it and look at your bar graphs and see if that s right yes it s not okay so which one is incorrect
one . one half 15th is less than one half 015th is less than 14th okay so and one half is so it should be 15th then 14th 14th then one half one half no
no 2 fifths 2 fifths 2 fifths then we had 3 fifths then the half then one half one half then one half then 3 fifths if you notice something
it how close is it to one whole after that we have so i have 55s one half then i should have what now what s next 3 fifths and . 4 fifths 4 fifths yeah okay group 2
fractions roll your die again and give me your fractions oops wait so all of that equals one whole not all of it did not equal to one whole you would look at it as how close are they the fraction is to that one whole 0 yeah wait a minute group 2
have 15th 2 fourths 3 sixths 2 sixths 3 fourths look at your bar graphs which is 1st ooh 3 . 3 sixths 3 sixths is 1st no
m 15th yes 2 fourths yes 2 sixths
bars no no it s improper wait one i m going to do that again it s right no it is an improper fraction there ain t no improper fraction there it s not an improper fraction i mean it s wrong okay so what s the 1st fraction now
m 3 fourths 16th 3 fourths you can t have 3 fourths roll it again
one half you got 15th one whole do another 12 thirds
13rd okay look at your fraction bars wait a minute wait a minute look at the fraction bars
0 no it s 2 thirds okay what next 13rd okay you already gave her one yes
14th yes 3 thirds 32 thirds you all are doing too much playing another person
and one half and one half yeah i thought one half no one half is before 0 yeah yeah 13rd let me see one half is greater look at it it says 16th see if that s right 16th yes 0 it s be quiet 016th 15th 14th no
13rd then it s 2 thirds then you said 3 fourths and then one half something s wrong ooh ooh i know it
it one so if you have one half is 13rd so if you have 2 thirds then you should have fourths if you have 13rd 2 thirds should be at the end 2 thirds then you have one half one half one half one half then it should be 13rd then no it should be yes 2 thirds look at 2 thirds no no 2 thirds is wrong isn t 2 thirds is supposed to be at the end
it look at 3 fourths 3 fourths is more than 2 thirds wait isn t 3 fourths goes 0 that s what is it one half goes before one . 13rd 3 fourths goes at the end goes at the end one half is . is less than one half look at your bar
3 fourths goes at the end i m looking at 13rd one . one half goes one here s your one half here s 2 thirds it that s right ah 2 thirds then still thinking about 13rd then 3 fourths should be at the end one half okay so let s calm down
what one half half then then 2 thirds 2 thirds and then 3 fifths 3 i told you fourths i m sorry fourths 3 fourths fourths yeah i don t hear it
okay now this is what i want you to do now now we talked about greater than and less than you better wake up
up teacher e now let s talk about equivalent fraction you re in a few minutes let s talk about equivalent fractions roll your die i got 2 fifths 13rd 6th because what i m going to do i m going to end up picking up i m just going to think of a fraction and you re going to find the equivalent to that fraction
0 man stop throwing it all on the floor
what fraction is equivalent to 2 twelfths teacher e
yes 16th 16th ooh how . how can i get 2 twelfths because equivalent to one sixths because 2 divided by 12 equals 6 and 2 divided by so i can do this divided by 2 equals 2 to 1212 i got 2 sixths what no
0 yeah you re right because 2 divided by 2 equals 2 divided into 120 is 66 is the answer but if i have 16th what did i do to get 16th you did you 0 so what who did that
because you 2 divided by 2 that would equal but how could i get 2 you did you multiplied you divided you divided okay so let s find a common what factor factor factor between 2 the numerator and the denominator say the strategy i said was one times 2 equals 22
let s do 122 times 6 equals 12 what s another 13 times 4 equals 12 or i could say one times 6 nope one times 12 equals 12 but we not going to count that no what is a common factor that you see between 2 and 1222 what is it
2 times 622 times and then 6 goes into 12 okay here what you said so i have 2 twelfths divided by by what 6262 equals 2 divided by 2 is
you re going to have to figure out what is the common factor and let s try . 8 tenths 8 tenths your paper
you re lost aren t you babe kind of
6 equals 1212 and 3 times 4 equals 12 so what s a common factor between 8 and 2 that you see i see a 2 a 2 i see a 4 and i see a 4 well which one are you going to use
okay it s wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute make sure everybody s no
all right
then i want you to write how do you change an improper fraction into a mixed number both i will turn it on in just a 2nd on a separate sheet of paper
same sheet of paper we are going to address these 2 questions okay so once you get those 2 questions down i am going to turn on the computer
yes can i have a pencil see if there is one on my desk you can use oops you can not talk to me and expect me to do that at the same time all right
there everybody have their question working we have done lots of changing improper fractions into mixed numbers
fraction you are going to need to know how to do this when we start multiplying and dividing fractions next week fractions we are going to move into multiplying and dividing fractions so we are going to have to know how to change a mixed number to an improper fraction if you will turn off the light please
do how much math not a lot of math changing a mixed number into an improper fraction okay numbers who can change 9 fourths into a mixed number do you want to come to the board and do that 9 numerator or denominator numerator the 4 is the denominator
explain to us what you are doing when you are doing it 1st you have to divide 9 by 4 do you want me to move okay 4 goes into 9 twice which is 8
then 9 -8 is one so it would be you can write it here okay write it in the box 2 remainder one and since 2 is the whole number we are just writing it
what 14th i think our calibration is off way we are going to change the mixed number to the improper fraction this some of you may remember
us 4 times 2 equals 8 then add one and the denominator stays the same and it equals 9 fourths okay steps if we were going to write the steps down for this some people already know it because you have run across this before
some people do not know how to do this so what would be our steps n multiply the denominator by the whole number there is a math word denominator is there another math word
number if we are using the example 2 and 14th we have 2 and 14th what am i going to multiply together 1st
step 4 times 2 step what am i doing next what am i doing next
then you have to add the numerator okay we are adding the numerator so i am adding one to what
9 the 9 becomes the numerator the 9 is the numerator remains so it is 9 fourths that ends up being your answer
on those are the steps that is all you have to do to change a mixed number back into an improper fraction it seems so weird to want to do that right we have been changing improper fractions to mixed numbers yes do you have to move the box to see if our answer is correct
do are we correct yes 9 fourths it is what we got okay
fraction i want you to use these circles and see if you can write it as an improper fraction have we have 3 wholes your teacher does not know how to work this half the time
in off 13rd okay so you are taking 3 and one thirds and you are trying to change it to how many parts are here
in this is one whole 2 wholes 3 wholes this is not a whole me 1st you are going to multiply the denominator by the whole number what is my denominator 3
9 3 times 3 is 9 then we are adding what one then you get 10 over 3 okay did everybody get that yes next one next practice are we writing these as samples you are writing these as samples you should have wrote 3 and 13rd and you should have wrote 10 thirds you do not have to draw the picture
1st figure out the wholes then go for the fraction
parts 6 6 we are waiting how many wholes do we have how many wholes all together do we have
4 how many are shaded in here 6 so our denominator is 6 right it is off a little bit a little off
number we are changing this number to an improper fraction what 6 and we are going to multiply it by the whole number so if our denominator is 6 and our whole number is 4 6 times 4 is what
24 and we are going to add our numerator 25 over 6
fraction it is like i need to hold it up there to hit here we are changing the mixed number back to improper
okay now i want you to figure out the mixed number 1st then we will give everybody a chance put your hands down so they do not get anxious if you are done write the mixed number 1st then the improper fraction
both do you want to well go sit on the floor with do you times this by this yes you do the denominator by the whole number
and that is the denominator that is the denominator yeah for some of us that are getting a little confused i am going to show where the denominator is the numerator and the whole number
this the 3 is the what the denominator actually it is on this chart paper here also
this is the numerator this is the whole number if you need a picture i am going to put in the operation signs also we have denominator times the whole number then you are going to add the numerator
sense what is my whole number one it is off one maybe you should calibrate it again we are okay one what is the shaded part
3 fifths so now we are going to change it to an improper fraction
8 8 over 5 is the any questions okay which improper fraction is represented by this picture
you are figuring out the mixed number then you are changing it to the improper fraction look at this picture vote show me your work on your paper 1st
is show me the whole number in the fraction and then you are changing it to the improper fraction have how many whole circles are shaded in
how many are completely pink fuchsia colored
in guys put your hands down until we are all ready
so we have how many wholes are filled in 3 sorry we have 3 wholes what is the fraction part
4 how many are shaded in 3 how many are pink
there is 4 sections if this is our circle do you see that this has 4 parts 4 our fraction is 14th i am changing this to an improper fraction
p so 4 times 3 is 12 4 next time i will get them for you
you which ones are completely shaded in purple anyone then look at this
circle how many parts do you see then how many are shaded in purple
2 how many parts do i have shaded in what let us count them one 2 3 4 5 6 7
purple just 30 goodness so 2 and 3 sevenths this is driving me up the wall it why do not you just try using the mouse 2 and 3 sevenths what am i doing to change it multiply 7 times 2
14 what is 14 +3 what 7 so our answer is 17 sevenths okay
try this one you how many wholes was there 2 7 times 2 is 14
14 +30 math okay paper how many wholes do i have
me yes so we have 2 wholes how many parts are here 3 how many are shaded
fraction 13rd we are changing 2 and 13rd into what fraction give me step by step directions
you do the denominator times the whole number so 3 times 2 is 6 +one 7 over 3 yay i have decided that if you go here it moves it
how many sections do you have there you are only talking about math answer where is the mixed number
it it is right here it is right there circled how many whole numbers do i have
4 i think it gets bigger every time i write okay parts 1st i need you to turn your chair around and look this way with your math journal open
how many parts were there bigger so 4 and 5 sixths you are changing that into an improper fraction so what would it look like changed back 4 6 and 4 is 24
29 29 over 6 job yes what if it is a whole number and an improper fraction good question we will get there
promise tell me the mixed number 1st the mixed number to improper fraction off you are not because this is messed up
1st i need to see it on your paper
adding and subtracting where is your journal some of you need to check yourself and see if your body language is listening done you are still waiting and listening what is the whole number
2 and 2 fifths how many parts 22 fifths what am i multiplying together 5 i am multiplying it by my whole number which is 2
10 i am adding the numerator which is 2 and i get what 12 fifths next one up figure out the mixed number then figure out the fraction then change it
how come it is 29 over 6 because you did i should not be hearing any extra conversation i should not hear any extra conversations 24 this should have been 5 not 4
what is my whole number one what is my fraction 14th what am i multiplying 4 times one
4 so the improper fraction is 5 fourths are you listening whatever color this whole number is shaded go with this as the whole part of the numerator
fraction figure it out whole keep your papers open so i can see
7 how many are shaded 5 now change it to an improper fraction it is too easy i am going to ask you that again next week when we are multiplying and see how you feel about it
who has not what is the whole number one what is the fraction 5 sevenths how am i going to figure out the improper fraction
5 5 is 12 sevenths next one picture you have 2 and 3 fourths you do not have a picture
paper do not have a picture you are about to exit the room
p all right doing 4 times 2 11 11 over 4
job flip the page okay this is your practice i am going to give everybody a chance to practice and i will give you a chance to come to the board and write it
problems make sure you get the problem written down correctly from the board that you get the whole number right and the fraction right keep the paper open
now i figured out that the black ones do not count right that is what is confusing there okay good i see some people drawing arrows and putting their multiplication or addition sign
i am choosing quiet people that are sitting up straight and ready to show their work you may start and after you go you may choose a boy fifths tell us what you are doing as you do it
d 5 times 8 is 40 and 2 +40 is 42 you have 42 over what
5 good 3 and one tenths you are choosing a boy that is sitting up quietly sitting straight answer we are doing 3 and 110th
3 times 10 and i got 30 plus is 31 10 your numerator is what you just did
31 31 over 10 good next one is 6 and 4 fifths you are choosing a girl 6 and 4 fifths everybody should be checking their answers to make sure you have the same number on the board
6 times 5 equals 30 then 30 +4 equals 34 so it would be 34 over 5 it put your 5
boy 10 times 4 is 40 +7 is 47
the denominator is 10 10 that is correct 5 and 14th choose a girl a girl that is sitting up straight and is ready to tell their answer
4 21 over 4
simple ready to make 100 yes we are about to take a test no
collect you may put your math journals away
you on the count of one you need to be ready
5 i am counting down 4 3 get in that direction 2 one
paper these 6 problems i am going to give you a grade you are changing the mixed number back into an improper fraction
number then draw an arrow do something to show me the improper fractions if you are sitting on the floor write the problems 1st then go back to your desk okay i am going to move it
you okay boys and girls please take out your add paper daily we practice this every single day
lots of the questions on the arithmetic developed daily are modeled right after the mcas test that we take in may right who can tell me today s date in a nice complete 4th grade statement today s date is tuesday january 24th 2012
a how bout a nice complete sentence sentences the rule of 5 there are . there are 31 days in january there are 31 days in january a it s my birthday it s your birthday how many more days are left in january how many more days until s birthday
days so what else do we know about 7 days week so what day of the week next week do you suppose anthony s birthday will be on tuesday tuesday because one week from today will be next tuesday and one week from tomorrow will be next job what month comes after january
k february february and how many days are in february agree nope how many days are in february student k 29 right
know do you think it is is i ve been hearing commercials lately that disneyworld is going to stay open for 24 hours on leap year day that so let s say the poem together so we never forget 30 days hath september april june and november
all the rest have 31 except february alone which has 28 days clear and 29 on leap year job how do you represent january numerically if you were writing the date how do you represent january numerically what s the numeric symbol for january
one because it s the 1st month of the year it s the 1st month of the year good school 5 i speak in complete sentences we ve been in school 85 days 85 days odd how bout a nice complete sentence
85 is odd why is 85 odd you re right why is it odd because it ends in 5 it ends in 5 you re right p even numbers end in . 0 6 let s try to stay in order though
p even numbers end in say em 10 well not 10 because what does 10 end in okay so we ve been in school for 85 days 85 just tell me something you know a fact about the number 85 besides that it s odd
a 810s and 51s 85 has 810s and 51s how do i write 85 in expanded form now how do i write 85 in expanded form 5 80 +5 very good 85 how many days are left until the 100th day of school
h there are 15 days left there are 15 days left until the 100th day of school
okay now let s go over our add paper and we ll do some mental math after here but everybody put their finger on the 1st problem what is the unit of measurement that they re asking us to measure something in
meters meters who can tell me how many centimeters are in one meter a 100 centimeters are in a meter you re right one the . area area
me we are going to be doing lots today about area and perimeter in our math lesson j you it has length times width area equals the length times the width it s what s inside right it s square units we usually talk about area width so what s the area in meters of that 1st rectangular array
8 we have a 2 by 4 don t we label meters squared now you know lots about perimeter now rap we know area and let s do perimeter with our finger
perimeter perimeter means add the sides add the sides area area means length times width length times width good job so we have to do what to this problem a add add the sides
about foot it s not on your paper it s in your brain foot there are 12 inches in a foot you re right good job
okay so when i add the sides 4 +3 +3 +5 +3 job who knows the symbol for inches if i didn t want to write in how could i represent inches with a symbol
h yeah good all right i had a question about this this morning
missus r i don t know the volume i multiply the length times the width times the height
5 this side is how many 2 and this side is how many 3 there are your dimensions what do i do with those numbers with length times width times height somebody told us already them what s 5 times 2 times 3 or 3 times 2 times 5 or 3 times 5 times 2
feet what s the symbol for feet good what has these 3 add ins all added up
m i want to set the problem up . vertical vertically you 326 +48 +14 326 +48 +14 now i need to make sure that i ve lined up my ones i ve lined up my 10s i ve lined up my 100s
i always want to double check and make sure it was 326 +48 +14 right who can tell me the sum of my ones
a leave the ones we re going to leave 81s and regroup 11s for a 10 8 and how many 100s do we have in our sum
3 so what is 326 +48 +14 good and now we have subtraction missus r is upset with the people who created this sheet because they wrote it vertically so i need to have the brains to set this up they wrote it horizontally
vertically who can read this number 1010 you know i m so proud of because he said 1010 he didn t say 1000 and 10 800 and 8 he knew 1010 -808
1010 -808 0 who can tell me what to do in a loud loud loud voice m borrow from the 1000s nope i don t need to borrow from the 1000s i was just thinking of something i have to do right away
k small number on top means it s time to stop borrow from the left it won t be called theft cross out the neighbor make it one less add 10 to the small number subtract with no stress 2 did anyone get 200 too
202 very good all right now i have a word problem about peter names if i didn t know how to say peter i would just call him pete mcas so who can read this to me because when i have a world problem what s my strategy
i need to read it . plan it solve it check it read it solve it plan it check it
reader go ahead peter had 1000 very good
a 111 records in his collection he sold 475 to a record store how many records did he have left very good time peter had what is it
remember when we re reading if you covered up these 3 numbers what does that comma say after the 1st 3 numbers there one nope this says one and then what do you say when you get to the comma
that one thousand . 111 there you go start reading again again peter has 100 what do you say when you get to the comma
1000 okay try it again peter has 1111 records in his collection he sold 475 to a record store how many records did he have left good job because you didn t give up you kept trying and trying and trying until you said that number correctly
you how many of you i m actually laughing to myself record even missus r when i was little records kind of went bye bye but what is a record a record it s like a multiple meaning it could be like a disk that plays music okay
right it s a disk that you play for music a tape recorder not a tape recorder what would you need player it has a plastic piece with a needle and the record spins around good okay so peter had 1111 records and he sold some
if you sell something are you adding it to yourself or subtracting it from yourself subtracting there you go subtracting and there s another key word there that i ve circled in my brain now circle the subtraction word there and raise your hand and give me a thumbs up when you have it left how many records did he have left
so i know any 2 subtract so my thought it s subtraction the 2 numbers that i need to subtract are 1111 and 475
right so my plan is to set that problem up vertically and this problem boys and girls is going to have to take a lot of regrouping what about if i m not very good at regrouping what s another strategy that i can use instead of regrouping
k i could count up on a . number line number line how many of you subtract with regrouping okay line i want to see if i could ask somebody i m almost thinking maybe
if i want to go from 475 to 1111 could you come up and show us the strategy of counting up let s see if could use the strategy of counting up to those are landmark numbers
let s see what landmark number chooses 0 those are very comfortable numbers
it very good
wow look at how nicely she spaced her numbers
yet okay let s see which her next strategy is missus r why didn t you leave me more room right see so slide your paper up a little so we can see what you just did
job all right let s see can you talk to us about that more can you tell us what happened do you add 5 to the next landmark number 480
500 then you +500 to 1000 +100 to 1100 then +11 to 1111 then i added the number and i got 636 records excellent you did a great job was how when she was adding the number at the top of her number line she put them in order from greatest to least
and she lined up her ones correctly her 10s correctly and her 100s correctly good now i need a master of subtraction with regrouping to go to the board why don t you go up and talk us through if you flip the paper over if you could tell us how you did it with subtraction with regrouping and then we ll see if and got the same response
it you can t take 7 away from 0 you are right
and i love the way you added a label too good job
today that takes a lot of courage to get up in front of your class so thank you all right who had 636 records bulb i have a yellow ticket for somebody who can tell me the answer
mean it means you don t use your pencil you use your brain go do the following chain of operations get ready to be a good listener 18 -8 times 2 -4 hands did you write it down in a line
j the answer is 16 ticket what is 18 -8 fast okay who can tell me on the line please a division problem with the quotient of 30
one what s a division problem that has a quotient of 30
15 is that a division problem what s a quotient what s a quotient who can help friend a quotient is a answer to a division problem
so what s a division problem that the answer is 30 20 600 divided by 20 equals 30
it yes what is it time it s people yelling out but skip count by 3
12 did we say 10 product this is a tough one 1900 divided by 6 are you sure it s 1900
i want you to write that problem out right now k 5 times 6 is 30 5 divided by 6 is not we can t think like that d 100 divided by 6
r 60 divided by 20 3 of think of something divided by something that equals 3 and add a 0 a 1800 divided by 36
yes 300 divided by 10 30
away all right my friends it is that time up but i have one last thing that i need to ask you today
weekend she wrote me a message on our classroom blog and she tried to solve a problem she came in on monday morning and she said missus r i m really having a problem with this
answer and i m going to tell you what she did now so if we go to our classroom blog and this is from a long time ago but this is the one that she wanted to solve who can read me we ve been practicing our multiplication facts
we started to learn how to multiply larger factors by breaking apart numbers here s a multiplication problem to think about and solve honey here is a multiplication problem for you to think about and solve
k each pack of oreos had 9 delicious cookies if there are 25 students in missus r s class how many cookies will she buy who can solve that problem right now
missus r wants to buy each of her students a package of oreos i did because we were writing about oreos remember buy and how could you break apart the factor 25
now maybe on the back of that what do you think g no i need to buy 25 packs buy if i buy 25 packs of cookies and they each have 9 cookies what s the number sentence
what s the number equation can anybody just tell me the equation 25 times 9 9 25 children times 9 cookies equals . who can break apart one of these factors
25 how can we break apart 25 please can you think of some add ins that we could add together and break apart 25
g you re right we could set it up vertically and solve the problem a 10 10 and 5 5 and what do we multiply each by
9 will equal 25 times 9 so since was one of the ones that came in could you come up to the easel right now and could you tell me how many cookies i need to buy if i wanted to buy each of my students a package of oreos and each pack had 9 delicious cookies
friend so chose the strategy of breaking apart the number
column good 4 what s 18 +4 22 so how many cookies 225
right who can come up and do 2 digits by one digit multiplication division division can you do division vertically we do that when we do long division sign
50 you re talking about like 2 digits by one digits good job miguel just scribble it out it s fine there you go
good job neat what could you add to that answer to make it even better okay so does everyone agree that we did need to do multiplication yes cookies we just made cookies very good
okay thank you for that right we re going to don t forget to check out our classroom blog because there s lots of math things that we put up there website and actually let s go to the link
lights let s play one round of our favorite game countdown i m going to press start
somebody give me a number excuse me could somebody give me a number between 20 and 30 that we want to make our goal today 25 so our goal is to beat 25 in 60 seconds let s see who s awake
ready wait a minute
ready here we go
up okay turn the lights on please here we go yes okay so we re going to take a 4 minute math drill
please 4 minute math drill now make sure you re on page one of 2 up please put your name can you give that to please
put your name 1st and last your grade my name and i m really proud to say that someone in this class this is a 4th grade class is no longer doing 4th grade drills they re doing 5th grade drills a fast fast champion
excuse me i m going to time myself later so i can be circulating all right so let s look at the aims web competition teams
teams here are our teams missus r s aims web fast fact competition so on the 1st team we have and challenging each other the 2nd team we have and challenging each other
on the 3rd team we have and challenging each other h we want to see how many digits we can get correct in 4 minutes
tickets 52nd place gets . 33rd 2 ready when i say begin i want you to work across the row if you get stuck on the problem put an x through it please
but try to work each problem carefully only if you really don t know it should you put an x through it are you ready e yes
yeah put your finger on the 1st problem
keep going good job good job
okay friends nice job
thank you
hey and let s take a look at the board we re going to have a goal today we re going to do some practicing for the math mcas we know that the math mcas is the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system
talking we know that you did a nice job missus r developed a recipe for success and the recipe for success if we follow those strategies we ll be successful
asked so the recipe for success we have lots of things that we need to follow when we re practicing for the mcas it but there s one other thing that we practice that i want to talk about today so who can read today s goal very quickly
can how many people think they could design a rectangular garden like a rectangular array with 96 square feet
right you definitely could how many of you know area and perimeter in your head right now so while practicing our mcas strategy today i ll be able to find the perimeter and area of ginger s garden i ll also be able to design another rectangular garden with an area of 96 square feet today boys and girls 4 years ago what year was it
ago in this class we raise our hand before speaking 2008 it was 2008 and guess what 4th graders in 2008 sat down to take their mcas test and when they did they saw a question about ginger s garden
this i m going to give you a copy of this question right now and who can tell me the very 1st thing you re going to do when you get this paper besides put your name on it who remembers what we call those little pieces of the question i count . count the elements count the elements
pieces how many questions are the people who are grading the mcas asking me mcas how many questions do i have to answer in order to have a complete response question said missus
3 and then i m going to count the number of elements elements go ahead feet flat floor right under your desk times count the elements
double check
it double check double check double check double check good job job did you have the number of elements
job question 10 is an open response question be sure to answer and label all parts of the question show all your work in your student answer booklet that means your diagrams your tables your computations if you do the work in your head explain in writing how you did the work head tell the grader this is how i did it
write your answer to question 10 in the space provided in your student answer booklet paper okay who can read me the problem voice and i was so proud of you that you had the number of elements correct it but are there any words that i should underline or circle up here
a yes answer labels all parts job is there anything else i should underline i think there is j show your work show your work explain in writing
ahead and guess what know perimeter perimeter means add the sides add the sides and may wrote perimeter is the distance around the shape and we know the song perimeter perimeter goes around and round
add up all the sides and then you write your answer down
a show or explain how you got your answer keep going so that the garden will still be a rectangle show or explain how you got your answer what are you doing very good okay
6 who had 6 in the top right corner let s go through and see how many answers we need to get this problem right element read me the 1st question that they ask you take that off of your head what s the 1st question that they ask you there s one
what s the perimeter in feet of ginger s garden what s the 2nd thing i have to do garden that s the 1st thing i have to have is the perimeter show or explain that s 2
a that s the 3rd thing i have to do i is show or explain
do you re right area and then the last thing i have to do is . show or explain girls today we re going to do something a little different
i think you are pros at area and perimeter how many think they re pros at area and perimeter okay i bet you could tell me the perimeter in feet of ginger s garden so fast and explain how you know i bet you could tell me the area in square feet of ginger s garden so fast and show or explain how you know
i bet you could make ginger a new garden that was 96 square feet and you could show me the dimensions while but right now i have a copy of student responses
these are the answers that 4th graders in 2008 just like you gave answer and it s going to be your job to score it with your group i want you before we do it i want you to see what they did i want you to see what a 4 looks like what a 3 looks like what a 2 looks like what a one looks like
4 how many elements are you looking for as you grade this person s paper 6 did this person answer 6 things explain did they give the area and show or explain did they give the length and width of ginger s new garden with 96 square feet
explain now is showing or explaining a computation sentence notice if it s right at the top it says do what should it have
label how many think they should see on a 4 an a b and a c could so it s your job with your group to decide what your paper got and then we re going to send one representative from each neighborhood up to talk about why you gave this response a 4 3 2 or one
right so i m just going to shuffle these up these are actual 4th graders from 2008 who did it group s see what you get that group it choose one person to read the answer
here you go time here you go
1st talk about the math feet well we don t know what s the answer so would you give that a point
area and it says 6 5 12 is 72 c so is the area right yes one okay but still is the area right so you might have to give that . what
2 one point right he didn t label though he didn t label you re right think okay so what was the perimeter what did she say 136 feet is she right
yes the perimeter and then she gave an explanation 72 well you re going to have to give this person some points see remember you re going to give one point right see what you would give this response
label yeah they did label did they explain their work that let s see what did we decide so now you re trying to solve the problem to see if she s right
together i m glad that this group knew that missus r kind of tricked you because in order to grade the paper what do you have to have
math so before we go into the lines and line relationships and the basic elements of geometry let s talk a little bit or i ll tell you a little bit about why we learn this so one of the reasons why we learn this subject in geometry is to follow signs when they have like pointed arrows or something like that tell you to go this way or go that way
this and when we want to plot points on a coordinate grid that s another reason why we learn this and it also helps us to be able to read a map and the directions of train tracks are in parallel lines so that s also another reason why learn this so when we see this in the real world
relationships we start off with our basic point or our basic element of geometry and that is the and here we have our and a point is named by a capital letter a we would right point a
a next we have a line segment and our line segment is a part of a line with 2 endpoints a part of the line with 2 endpoints you see the 2 dots at the end are the 2 points a line segment is named by the 2 letters and the 2 letters are always capitalized and we have line segment ab
ab line segment ab along we have a ray and a ray has one endpoint and one arrow that arrow means that it continues on and on infinitely in that direction so a ray is also named by the 2 letters
again those 2 letters are capitalized and we have ray cd cd one endpoint one arrow ray cd
following the ray we have a line and a line has no endpoints but it has the 2 arrows at the end and those 2 arrows at the end are to let you know that the line goes on and on forever in both directions directions so here we have an example of that and this is line qr again it s named by its letters and those letters again are capitalized
qr and here s another example of a line not a dot this would be line rs
so once we have those lines the point the ray and a line segment those lines would have relationships so we re going to skip through this part right here the angles and go down to the line relationships
relationships 1st we have parallel lines parallel lines are lines that go on forever in the same direction and they never cross they never get closer together and they never get further apart
forever next we have perpendicular lines perpendicular lines are lines that do cross but they cross in a particular type of way corner so perpendicular lines cross but they form a square corner or a right angle
right so it s like that capital l but you have the line going across the other side good our last line relationship are or is intersecting lines lines so remember in just words we learned sect means to cut so intersecting lines are lines that cut through one another
so intersecting lines cross at a certain point show me intersecting lines with your arms good so we have our point our line the ray our line segment and a line then our line relationships are parallel lines perpendicular lines along with intersecting lines
throw it away throw it away yes when you get geoboards make sure you don t have any pegs missing because it may be a spot that you need
yes so let s start off with all of the dots on the geoboards can represent the points segment a line segment has 2 endpoints no arrows you i am going to demonstrate for you a line segment
segment this would be a line segment 2 endpoints no arrows segment take that one off you yes
okay a line segment now let s try a line line so the line has how many arrows 12
2 arrows so you are going to need 3 rubber bands for this one cause you are going to need to make an arrow on both sides that is a line segment very good
excellent this is going to be in the wrong spot yes 0 yeah that s even a better idea yes
right has just showed me how to make the arrow as opposed to the triangle so if you pull the middle piece up over there now if you pull that s the triangle
so if you pull the middle piece up like this and bring this one all the way down that s the arrow yes yes yes
up there you go so you pull the middle you are going to have to take that from under there yes
got it on both sides good job okay very good but bring the ends all the way to the arrow so you are going to have to stretch the line part out go let s try a ray ray how many endpoints for a ray one how many arrows one all right so we ve got an endpoint
we got a beginning or ending and then a side where it just keeps on going c you said a what good job
yes this middle part there and pull that over there pull this all the way up pull it up from here yes once you have your triangle you can make it to the arrow and then you pull very good and then you pull the line all the way up just put it right there what s this like this yes good job
mine came out like this that s these are squares you put it on the right it wouldn t even come out like that it and you put it over like this now do the next side okay
now let s work on our line relationships lines somebody raise your hand and tell me what parallel lines parallel lines describe parallel lines to me
parallel lines that never cross yes they never cross go please show parallel lines with your boards parallel lines together are these lines or line segments lines no line segments
right arrows are those lines or line segments lines those are line segments parallel lines those are line segments those are line segments look a line segment
what s the difference between the line and the line segment the arrows right do you have the arrows have 2 arrows all right
rays just wrap it
no yes i need more rubber bands what was that all right good job
go next let s make perpendicular line segments perpendicular line segments explain perpendicular where are we cross yes do they cross yes what s special about perpendicular lines when they cross
cross they form a right angle they form a right angle yes very good angle so show me perpendicular line segments perpendicular line segments here you go
made a right angle yes very good let s make this a little smaller you don t have to they are not crossing all the way you have to show me the square corner but show me the cross
i made a i did what s the diamond these are the arrows no you don t need to add the arrows for a line segment yes
team you don t need this part yes these are lines so you don t need any arrows
good remember the line segment has just the endpoints no arrows perpendicular means that they are going to have the square corner yes yes do we get intersection lines that s going to be the next one
go next intersecting lines intersecting lines or line segments go yes very good intersecting that means they cross at a specific point intersecting yes
very good very good very good intersecting thank you yes very good
i like those intersecting let s see them cross right got it way very good
okay okay let s see
i am going to have some of you come up and draw for me on the board these lines and these line relationships
okay when i pick your name out of the bucket you are going to come up and draw either line point ray or whichever one i say 1st name choose the marker you like
a come and draw point a a thank you point a
next let s draw line segment ij ij line segment ij
ij i know all this that s a ray wrong that s a ray up you got to go diagonal no she got to keep a straight one
that s wrong she have to go straight let her do it and we ll see
straight you are missing a dot the endpoints very good ij so line segment we have our 2 endpoints named by 2 letters and they are capital
next show me intersecting lines lines one line is ab and one line is cd and make them intersecting intersecting lines ab and cd
lines ab
job so we have intersecting lines point intersecting line ab and interesting line cd lines ab and lines cd are intersecting let s get a couple more parallel lines ef and gh
parallel lines ef and gh
gh capital the g should be capital good job gh parallel they keep going on and on
cross they never get closer together or further apart see next ray cd
cd good job a ray one endpoint one arrow capital letter cd
one perpendicular lines lines perpendicular lines good job
lines lines that cross and form a square corner or 4 right angles now we re going to count off in 3s remember our 1st group is with me 2nd centers 3rd computers
here one
312
go ones in the back 2 centers 3 is computer 2 s what centers she s telling us to back up to the it s all girls excuse me
let s go back if your number was a 2 you are at centers computer no i took out what i want you to do
boxes you do not have to go in the boxes everything is out
this i took out what i want you to do
5 give me that 4321 okay let s start off with calendar math
13th the 13th so we need to add one more school day to our calendar days and you do the same on your calendar math
school okay do we need to add a heart yes why do we need to add a heart to 65 no a star a star okay
yes because it s not going by 3s okay says we re counting by 3s every 3 explanation is 65 a product of 3 65 yes 55 times 3 is what 15 can you say 3 times something gives us 65
no so then that s not can i have the tape square do we need a square for 65 yes yes please add a star to your 65 because 65 yes
65 is a product of 5 okay
all right all right next we need to add a 5th to our 5 and change our fraction
so you add a 5th on your paper and we need to add our 10 centimeters so color that in blue
blue all right and we re adding either 10 centimeters or what one what what 11 meter no
yes one decimeter one decimeter thank you
please all right so how many fifths do we have now d 2 and how many fifths 0 13
okay we have 13 fifths because today is the 13th d 2 and 3 fifths 2 and 3 fifths yes how many meters do we have
we have one whole meter and then we have one one point what yes yes yes one.8 yes one.3
one.3 meters or if we re counting centimeters this would be 10 20 30 40 50 total 50 how many do we have total 50 this is 10 20 30 40 50
100 how many do we have total 130 130 centimeters how many decimeters do we have decimeters is one whole box because 10 centimeters equals a decimeter today yes
13 okay if we need to add a penny so now we have ¢65 you can just simply add a penny to your drawing from our 64 to ¢65 and who will be today s time
because today is the 13th all right when you re finished updating 0 we have one more thing money i always forget today is the 13th 20 can anyone do that on the back of their calendar math sheet
is yes 260 260 did anyone do it in their head figure that out in their head
thinking you know that 5 times 20 is what 100 so if you had 5 20s then you have 100 what 200
200 okay we have 60 there 200 here and 7 becomes a 99 so now we have 900 let s count our 10s and see if we can trade these 10s in for a what 100 how many 10s do we need to make 100
10 let s count them 123456789 10 that all right we have 9 100s 10 10 100s which equals
1000 1000 so now our 7 is 8 and then we take all these and we have there
so now who can tell me how much money we have in our daily deposit 8036 8036 yes
yes in 2008 the pop population population of was 14932400 932 what 400 932 what 1000 483
483 what go ahead what is this number rounded to the nearest okay so what do we need to do for this and what should you have done on what did you do on your paper
circle the 9 and underline the 4 okay because the 4 is in the what 1000000s okay so we underline the 1000000s place and we circle the helper
5 everything after the 5 becomes a 0 next one estimate
what yes m the nearest 100 the nearest 100s okay why yes because that s the highest that they could go up to
helpers what does the one tell the 3 to do same everything after the 3 becomes a 0 all right we have 9 to 1010 and what comes up everything after the 9 or 10 becomes a what
22 so this 985 becomes 1000 subtract so we do line up the place value subtract
032 -one away put your hands down number 3 sue likes to bake cupcakes
day 2 she made 245 cupcakes day 3 she made 145 cupcakes if she made the same amount on day 4 and day 5 how many did she bake on day 5
yes add them we need to add what 4 +54 +5 okay what do we need to add yeah 4 +5 well 1st of all what question are we answering
okay so how could we restate that there were yes there were yes someone there were what question are we answering
how many did she bake on day 5 okay so if we re answering that question if i said how many did she bake on day 5 you would say she baked okay
245 day 3 145 day 4 we don t know day 5 we don t know but we know these 2 are the same right
c add all the numbers from day 12 and 3 okay so we re going to add we re going to add day 12 and 3 so we can do that 245 +145 +132
121 +455 +499 +3 121 +233 +144 +15 okay us what does this tell us
the total amount of cupcakes for all 3 days yes subtract from 522 with 932 okay 932 minus the total minus what she made for the 1st 3 days so that would be 522
203 -219 -54 okay so do we take this and fill it in here
no put thumbs up if you think 410 is the answer for 4 and 5 all right so tell me what do i need to do out it says if she made the same amount on day 4 and 5 how much did she bake on day 5
all right we know that these 3 days add up to 522 so these 2 days must add up to what what yes of the bakery i mean the cupcakes no
yes how many she baked out of 522 yes how much she baked for 4 and 5 okay this is the total right so then how much did she bake on day 4 and how much did she bake on day 5 if the total is 410
how do we figure that out we would do day 4 and day 5 we don t know we don t know but we know that the total is 410
what plus what and it says she baked the same amount on day 4 and day 5 so that means these 2 numbers need to be the same and they need to equal 410 know what do we do
if you cut the 4 in half there s 2 okay so he said break this basically without the 410 this is 400 right so he said if he was breaking up 400 he d give them 2 and this 2
m if you divide okay so he said he s going to divide the 10 and then we ll get 5 and 5 so then how much did she bake on day 4 205 and how much did she bake on day 5
question yes okay so sue baked blank on day 5 205 number 4 joe competed in 7 sporting events this summer each event had 2 miles of running 15 miles of biking and 5 miles of running
bike let s restate the question what are they asking us what are they asking us
okay so we can say joe biked blank miles question i want someone to tell me what i need to do to answer that question joe competed in 7 sporting events this summer
each event had 2 miles of swimming 15 miles of biking and 5 miles of running bike what do we need to do
i had it but yes joe competed in 7 sporting events this summer
each event had 2 miles of swimming no each event have 5 or 15 miles of biking yes yes we do because we re saying joe biked blank miles so 15 miles of biking and 5 miles of running no no because that s not what the question is asking us
top joe competed in 7 sporting events this summer do multiply 15 times 7 15 times 7 15 would be the number of miles multiplied by the number of events
okay 7 times 5 35 10 how many does this answer the question yes joe biked 105 miles
all right and number 5 which equation which shows an equation that is true correct all right put your daily reviews away
in okay stay with that person and you re going to have to explain to me what you guys have in common hold your card up because other people may want they may need to join your group
no no no it hold it up
when you have your group come to the front right here because you guys are jumbled up and i can t see who has found someone and who has not okay so you guys kind of scoot over so you guys are a group these 2 and then you 2 okay if you have not found your partner then don t come to the front
it who are you with okay you re good together who are you with no
okay you guys who don t know hold your cards up and maybe these people can help you here huh forgot to write her okay why is with you
because okay do you agree yes do you agree okay card what does he have 49 divided by 7 49 divided by 7 what would that be okay so where might he belong or what group may he belong with and and
m okay what do you have okay she has 132 divided by 12 why because 12 times 11 is 132 have 8 times blank equals 56
belong 8 times 78 times 7 okay belong 12 divided by i m sorry 180 divided by 12 because 9 times 12 is 108
belong okay well then come over here because you re standing by someone and you don t have a group 12 anyone have a 12 group who does your group have 3 your group has 3 group what would be an equation that would fit with 6 because they have 6
they have he has 6 and then she has 54 divided by 9 which is 6 how could what type of card could have to fit in that group yes 2 what type of what would equation look like that would fit with that group yes 6 times blank
6 times 8 no 12 well how does 12 fit with that group yes one times 61 times 6 or how about 6 times blank equals 36 and then you would fill in the 6 right that would be a good one okay what i want you to do is have a seat with your group so wait wait
and her group have these 3 seats cards and his group take these 3 seats
44 seats and her group take these 3 seats and this one and then and his group take 123 okay so okay
and your group can have a seat over here what group do you belong to huh if you weren t in a group you should have been where there no you weren t i was by
go sit by please all right let s look let s take a look at the division problem that has it says 12 or 108 divided by 12
okay who can give me the quotient yes okay did how did you know all right
then if 9 is the quotient than what would be considered the divisor think about that word divisor what would be the divisor why why do you think that would be called the divisor what do you think 12 12 is right 12 is the divisor
divisor because that s what by yeah that s what this number is being divided by the divisor all right and then the last word of a division problem is called the quotient divisor dividend
okay so i m going to give you a problem and i want you to help me set it up using these words okay
problem all right the sidewalk it says the sidewalk crew knows that the sidewalk has 330 square feet
feet the sidewalk is 5 feet wide over here
wide how long is the sidewalk the sidewalk is 330 square feet
325 325 because you subtract the 5 no 1st of all this will be a division problem or a multiplication problem where one factor is missing
so i think it would be better to set it up as a division problem who can label these numbers using the division words yes 330 is the dividend okay 330 is the dividend so the dividend goes here
m the 5 is the 5 is the divisor us how long how long the sidewalk is okay so let s take a look at this
one it doesn t come out so clean as that one but let s take a look at it 320 so what we did here is we said 12 times something gives us 108 right so 5 times something will give us 300 or close to 300
300 yes 30 okay 5 times 30 what 5 times 3 15
what 6 300 300 okay 5 times 6 is 30 and then add the 0 okay so this is the closest we can get or no
yes 71 because look 5 times 70 will give us 35 and that would be too too much one all right where would the 60 go
yes or what would the 60 be considered part of the yeah quotient part of the quotient so let s put the 60 up here okay this is how division works
have we subtract it we subtract this 300 from the dividend so we have 330 -300 30 then we do what what do we do with that 30
yes subtract it from the 6 we divided we saw 5 times what gave us close to 330
again no remainder the remainder cannot be more than 5 so can 5 can 30 be divided by 5 again yes yes so 5 times what 6 gives us something close to 30
66 so we put the 6 here and we do 6 times 5 gives us 30 no so then what would be the remainder shh what would be the quotient we have 6 and we have 60
66 that was just something today but that s good that you guys were able to figure that out
what i m going to do with your groups is i m going to give you some things and then using the number that you had in common with your group members you re going to divide that
like i want you to write a word problem well i m going to help you write a word problem and then i want you to make your problem look like this okay it we have blank blank whatever you have
so let s say i had i ve got my pile of stuff and i had 59 pieces of candy okay this will be my stuff
candy i need to equally share equally divide
that we need to equally i need to divide it between blank people and this number is going to be what your group had in common
common 88 what did your group have in common 9 what did your group have in common 77 what did your group have in common 11 11 so it could be 11 it could be 7 people it could be 6 people it could be 8 people whatever your number is okay
i need to divide it between 7 people each person will have blank blank do you understand what i m saying
59 i would say i have 59 candies i need to divide it between let s say the number i had in common with my group was 7 i need to divide it between 7 people each person will have and i need to divide my candies okay
person i m going to give you a piece of paper and times you re going to copy this and then you re going to figure out how to solve it okay your group this group and i ll take your cards remember the number you have in common huh
okay you re going to work with them who are you working with them okay let me give you an item
remember the number you have in common 9 okay re copy that nice and big
that s it i m going to give because i have them all i have them all mixed up huh yes you did up what number did you guys have in common 6
her one how many do you guys have 5 i mean 6 we have blank blanks you guys count them already did you count them
96 sorry who is going to write you we have blank marbles marbles count them all together 1st you can t count and you can t count
somebody has to count them that s not going to work
hand this is a mess we have 220 gift bags
bag erase that i need to divide them between okay go ahead 9 10 11 12
16 17
11 people so this is one person this is 2 persons what has to do with the 11
people so you have 11 people you get one you get one you get one
have i need to divide them between 9 people
common yes okay 46
you need to divide it between how many people what number did you have in common 77 so write that
we need to divide it between 7 people got it
do you guys understand what you re doing so each person will get how many
3 all right now set up the problem it could be whatever you want it to be 9 and 3 27 +2 is 29
we gave everybody 9 and you need to divide i need to divide it between 11 people so here is my 11 people he gets one he gets one he gets one he gets one
that s 4 people 5 people 6 people 7 people 8 people 9 people 10 people 11 people that s the 11 people they all have one can they get another one and still have the same amount no you re supposed to write what s in the box according to your problem what s the quotient what s the dividend
divisor okay i have 56 57 marbles we need to divide it between 6 people
each person gets 9 marbles okay we have how many left over hold it right there you re going to have to explain yes no
so why do you want to get up and put your face in there and do all that i don t know because you ll never see it i asked you not to do that yes good that would be the dividend
what would be the divisor listen to your it says i need to divide it between 9 people what would be the divisor 9 okay so then what was the quotient 3 each person got what
label them and then explain how is it 9 i mean 3 that s what you need to discuss with your group right no because there s 9 of these figure that out with your group that s a good observation
we have 52 cotton balls balls okay so then what did you did you have any left over do tear them up and put them in your pocket okay you need to figure out 0 okay
4 okay so what does that remainder 4 mean it wasn t enough for everybody okay you re going to need to explain that to the class okay it seems like everybody has gotten to a point where they are almost finished so each group is going to stand up share their items what they had what they came up with and the things that they discussed with their group members
down okay so s group is going to go 1st shh group i need everyone else quiet can i stand up okay we had 52 cotton balls i need to divide it between 8 people
each person will have 6 cotton balls so i have a couple of questions
balls how many how many cotton balls did you use i used to divide between the 8 people 6 for everybody 6 for 8 people okay so how many was that total 48 so then 48 you had 52
48 so then what what did you do with the other 4 play remainder okay you discovered that the 4 would be the remainder in your division problem okay so what you have left would be considered your remainder explain what you have and what you got
we have 57 marbles we need to divide it between 6 people each person will have 9 marbles okay
okay so what s this here you have 57 marbles divided between 6 people
9 where does the 9 fit into the equation you is your group ready
ready 46 stamps need to divide 7 people i need someone who can speak loud enough for everyone to hear or they re just going to start talking we have 46 stamps and 5 people you need to divide it between i see 7
0 we have 7 groups each group got 6 okay and that gave us our answer okay so how many stamps did you use there s 6 for each group okay so how many did you have left over
4 okay all right i need everyone to sit down and look at the board and we re going to discover how you end up with those leftovers what those leftovers actually mean okay so give me your problem
the divisor is the divisor is 8 the dividend is 52 and you said that your quotient was 66 what did i do to these 2 numbers when we when we did our problem together
6 yes you multiplied i multiplied them and when you multiply 8 times 6 what do you get
it okay 12 -844 -40 is that how many you guys have left after you divided them up equally between 8 people that will be called your remainder and some of you discovered that and some of you were puzzled on what you do with the ones that are left out
let s look at s problem was the divisor was the dividend was was 3 you multiplied 3 times 9 27
272 was that how many you had left over do you understand how there can be some left over once you divide it
okay your divisor 77 your quotient i m sorry dividend 46 quotient 14
6 okay you multiply 6 times 7 42 46 -424 is that how many you guys had left over 4 let s try it with let s use all right give me your divisor
110 this one is going to be this is not going to be a good example okay who else didn t i see one let s say we had the same problem okay but instead of realizing that we were to give each group 6 we thought 5 was good okay
so we do 5 times 7 and that would say that we use 35 marbles pieces of candy whatever you have okay we ll do 6 -5 that gives us one and 4 -3 gives us one could this be the remainder
yes if we have 11 left over could we give 7 people one more could so the remainder can never be bigger than the divisor
does that make sense because if the remainder is bigger than the divisor then that means that you can divvy out one more time you can give them one more cotton ball or one more stamp okay because you have enough to do that but with 4 you didn t have enough to give everybody one more did you
no all right so that s what you were doing when you said okay everybody gets one everybody gets 2 everybody gets 3 and then when you got to a point where you didn t have enough to give everybody another one and that s how you knew that you had some left over or you had a remainder remainder cannot be bigger than this number okay
so this would not be right everybody understand kind of yes what remainder what remainder is and how we divide things equally all right what i need you to do is gather up all your supplies i m going to come around or teacher k is going to come around and collect it
friends if you all would please take out your homework we re going to go over it quickly
everyday they have but we re not using that yet answers everyone be good yes everyone be good all right come on in guys
5 4 3 2 all right for wednesday in the addition column what do you have
how do you say that give her a 2nd yes very good
193700 if you re just coming in you can catch up with someone next to you bottom what do you have for subtraction on the homework yeah
d 300900 38900 38900 maybe okay you can clip down when you go to your room because it s already supposed to be here
have subtraction was 38900 honey you have it written down 6671 division what do you have
i left it at home you need to go clip please division what do you have 13 just 13 13 problem solving this one was a little tricky 409 got some disagreers maybe
i ll talk to no did you all get this copied into your journals
problem lots of different answers for this one so we need to prove it 399 we got 400
okay 400 okay have a seat and we ll check it in a 2nd okay out the question was shelby had 692 colored beads
her cousin gave her 329 more she wants to make a necklace that will have 1420 beads how many more beads must shelby collect to be able to make her necklace sounds like it know what do we know
we know that she wants to make a necklace that has 1420 beads that s right she wants to make a necklace that requires 1420 beads right okay so here is the amount that she has so far
that let s talk about then we ll compare the 2 bars what she wants and what she has know what do we know
know that there are 692 beads she starts out with 692 correct is that right then what then you add 329 more
it add it to where the 692 329 okay now i m going to draw this line here
yes so how do i find out how much this is 329 do you all agree with that
329 who s got that yes the answer is 1020
yeah i think that s where that one came in because 2 +9 is what 11 so i can t have a 0 there 12 then 10 10 so what she has is 1021
so how do i subtract how many she needs subtract what 1420 take away this amount will give me this
get yes right now i want you to do this okay you can do it right here on the back go ahead and start writing start writing doing the math
it no where did you do the subtraction around we re not waiting for someone else to come up with it
math what do you think her it doesn t mean it has to be confusing to you
what s confusing let s go through the steps and see what you did
think you re going to need to borrow okay 9 possibilities it can t be 400 one -2 okay i need to borrow again right
9 okay so 9 91 okay 3 -0 is 3 one -one is 0 so 399 more
all right so count of 3 back to me one 2 3 okay did you see how the extra one here ended up to be the extra one there happened we had a lot of 409s and 419s for answer choices
i maybe they didn t subtract correctly i m thinking they didn t do the 2nd step of borrowing because i want us to take a look at that really quick what would have happened 420 -1021 okay most of you got that you needed to borrow in the ones right because you ended up with a 9 there
you did that and you got your 9 there how do you think some people ended up with a one here instead of a 9 do they kind of you can t take 2 away from one not like this right they didn t borrow here
they did 2 -one instead which would have given them that and then it would have given them the 4 yes they might not have crossed out the 2 when they borrowed possibly they got a 0
right so let s take a look that was our problem solving one see fractions do you have which fraction is greater 9 tenths or 9 elevenths i didn t do that one
let me take a look at your paper really quick so what do you think disagreement you disagree
thought because if you have there s 19 tenths and 19 elevenths if you have i m listening you should have it divided up into tenths and you should have had 9 of them and that would leave you with one but if there was 11 then there is 9 and that would leave you with 2
0 so you were kind of to recap what you said a little bit you re suggesting that because i left 2 here instead of just one that told you this would be more yes because 9 elevenths it would take like 2 numbers to get to 11
that s kind of i think what was saying too and something you might want to take a look at and consider and this is such a hard concept with fractions but really the number that is on the denominator tells me what about my fraction awesome what does my denominator tell me about this box
turn and talk to a partner and tell me what does the denominator tell me about my box go all right count of 3 back to me one 2 3
discussing what does the denominator tell me about my 2 rectangles here
bit did you mean the denominator down here that tells you how many there are so can i do for example one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 no but that s how many there are so how can we rephrase what we said just a little bit to make it a little more precise
say it means how many equal groups are there it means how many equal groups we have yes yeah okay so if i have 10 equal groups think of this as if i have 10 people to share with or 11 people to share with and i have the same amount i have a candy bar that s this large and a 2nd candy bar the same size
i m going to either share it with 10 people or 11 people which pieces are going to be larger sharing with 10 or sharing with 11 bigger isn t it kind of funny that the lower the denominator the bigger the pieces
yes right unless you split it with someone you wouldn t eat that many to yourself yes this is true so 2 3 40 wait off let s take a look at what that might look like
10 is that right one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 i still did 12
off 6 7 8 9 10 11 this just start with one box i can t because they need to be the these need to be the same size
it s hard doing elevenths because it isn t an even number so let s see go i ve got one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
go it s not very precise but it will work when we get ready to do our work at the tables you ll have your fractions that are more exact so let s just see 4 5 6 7 8 9
9 now granted these are not very precise fractions of my bar here but take a look can you see that 9 of the smaller pieces the elevenths are not quite as much as 9 of the tenths because the tenths are a little bit larger
if it s a candy bar i d rather have 9 tenths than 9 elevenths this one s definitely larger time on geometry just a 2nd sweetheart on the geometry it said to draw a rectangular prism have how many faces does a rectangular prism have
good measurement rectangle has a dimension of 23 centimeters long and 23 centimeters wide no how many yes s for 37
no s how many people think it s 37 742 popular answer choices huh right it s taking a lot longer than we anticipated
quickly if i have a rectangle eyes up here for a moment here i have a rectangle so the dimensions are 23 centimeters and 14 centimeters okay what do i need
i need to know how to get the perimeter before i start solving right okay so what does it mean to get the perimeter what the centimeters so what would you add here sorry then what do you get
37 what s wrong with that when you do that okay
i think was saying he thinks it should be because if i add 23 and 14 i get this right that s only half so what else would i need to do to get the perimeter are they re the same centimeters they re the same length what s the same length
the long side is the same length the long side is the same and the short side is the same the 2 short sides are the same yes so in order to get the total perimeter i have to add this with that right
74 all right
37 yeah i know that this is 37 37 saves me a step right did you know
right no bragging that s because some people have been bragging at them too
683503 okay then for the pattern down below 70 84 98 bottom that took a lot longer than we normally do
all right do what do we put what we got correct the amount you got correct
right we re getting ready to start in our groups see will you hand me the box of index cards please thank you okay will you be so kind as to make sure everyone gets one
yep how cute is that all right can you put tht up for me
up all right 5 4 3 2 one who is you don t need to be behind me
seat hold your pencils still please is handing out the index card
it next thing we re going to do i m going to wait until everyone s quiet and listening
quick i want you to fold the card in half please okay all right go here s my index card
okay numbers on one side drawing on the other with your name up at the top corner
in the 1st group when you come back to the table i need you to bring your fractions kit that we created over the last few days one you can borrow someone else s until we get some time later to help you set up yours let me have let s see i m going to pull let s do group one
we have and kit you know what
ms c came unprepared thanks all right good i feel like i m missing somebody
b she s probably trying to get her fractions kit somebody grab an extra chair
chair we re just going to pull them out little by little dump the other day we worked with the tiles remember and we got we did designs that had to be one half what
remember one of these has to equal one equals 14th when we worked with the tiles hands out of the bags for just a 2nd minute when we did the designs with the tiles the other day in the class and we did the poster up there we had to make the designs one half what color
blue yes they had to be half blue and remember how all the designs had different amounts of tiles in them and we talked about how it didn t really matter how many tiles you used as long as you used an equivalent fraction for half i want to talk a little bit about what some of our equivalent fractions are for half take the green one half bar out
one or both just one is fine because we re doing just one of the halves okay now yesterday when we met we talked about some equivalent fractions to one
bit we noticed that one equaled i m doing it upside down 2 halves that we also said that one equaled how many fourths 4 fourths 4 fourths we did eighths too
how many 8 eighths 8 eighths all right so today instead of it equaling one we re going to see how many equal to one half so let s start with fourths don t pull out the pink ones
out gentlemen let s stay on task please okay all right so i want to predict i wonder how many of these fourths is it going to take to be the same length as my half
we re not doing it take a look at your fourths take a look at your halves you have a prediction what do you think i was going to say 2.5 you were going to say 2 plus a part of it yeah says it s going to be 2 plus a little more
they re big then when you put one on there it takes up half of the space and then you put another one and half of it is going to be like off of it
prediction i think it will do that tell me in words don t show me
hard how many do you think it will take 2 why 2 like i know that like 2 fourths equals one half 2 fourths you think equals one half them what do you think
i know one +one equals 2 and how much could 2 go into one think did it work
right so when i get ready to write one half hey guys yes it did didn t it up what do you think we should try now
eighths i wonder how many eighths that is going to equal it might be 3 i don t know i think it will only be 4 eighths i agree i d like to hear some predictions 4
right what s your prediction how many of the eighths do you think it will take to be equal to the half 4 what s your prediction 5 4 3 2 much better
you okay all right what do you think task i can t find my box and everything i need is in it
it you can use something else if you need to
prediction because of this right here if you look at the other ones these they re kind of like the same so you put one down and then you kind of go like this kind of helps you visualize how many more you need too with my fingers
0 all right so try it with the 4 that we predicted and see what happens work you guessed did putting one down help you see it a little bit help you make a prediction
all right so what if i said let s put away the eighths for a moment should we try sixteenths next yes i think we ll have to use all of them you think you ll have to use all of them 8
predictions all right see i said 2 times 8
right i think i ve got them all did you find it
16 they re really stuck in there aren t they you think it s going to be 8 8 and 8 is 16
one all right go ahead our prediction is you might have more stuck in your bag the prediction was 8
happens one 2 my grandma tells me to shut my crap hole
i guess that s one nice way one way of putting please be quiet huh that s okay
what are you working on
flashcards your number is under vocabulary get the index cards not the flashcards the index cards so what would you have to say about our prediction here
one one 4 okay all right we are currently right now we are in we are doing our daily review and the problem says a landscaper is installing a lawn sprinkler system she has a tube 108 feet long so here is my tube
long but it says that i need to cut up my tube into 18 equal parts if i need to cut up my tube into 18 equal parts someone said that i needed to divide so i am going to turn my paper over because it is easier for me to do that
lines and i am going to put this like this 0 18 can go into 108 how many times 6 me i did 8 times i mean 8 divided by 108
okay and the problem stated the problem stated right here that it needed to be cut into 18 equal pieces not 8 equal pieces so that is why as readers you need to be careful when you are reading okay if your hand is up right now i am just going to go through daily review because we are a little bit behind schedule subtract and the answer is is it 6 or what should i have after my 6 60 this is a 6
the answer is 6 but is it 6 hands 6 hats 6 feet 6 feet if you go back it says feet long 108 feet long solve 4 equals how many pints
12 that is actually it is how many quarts 4 quarts equals one gallon okay 6000 milliliters equals how many liters 6 6 because we know that 1000 milliliters equals what one one liter and we can do the next one easily
okay instead of one half what would it be if just if you look at this 1000 milliliters equals one liter and we have 2 and 5 tenths of a liter right here think 2 and 500
2500 now 3 quarts is about how many liters because i know that one quart is about one liter so 3 quarts is about 3 liters and if 3 liters is about 3 quarts blank liters is about one gallon
4 roland weighs 70 kilograms and mark weighs k kilograms so i know that roland and this is roland roland he weighs 70 kilograms and mark weighs k kilograms
kilograms write an expression for their combined weight try all right if you messed up let us see what your partner has to say
try no you cannot use the i put i put other okay what did your partner say think i think it is like 70 plus k
k equals combined weight okay equals the combined weight but it is an expression graph before i even make a bar graph i want to know i want to know what are the parts of my graph need and if you do not know look at your i am just going to circle this know it tells you everything that you need to know
so what do you need when you are making a graph you need what you are graphing you need to know what you are graphing and do we know what we need to graph
increments and increments are the count c you need your x and y axis this is your y
and this always helped me remember that that is my y axis you do not have to put that there though title yeah so my title is right here so raise your hand if you put your title on your graph
labels you need a label for your y axis and you need a label for your x axis and guess what they have already given you the labels what are those labels go where do you think the frequency on the x axis because our numbers usually go on the
here so the frequency is going to go here and i am just going to thank you and instrument and i am going to label my instruments i have 12341234 and you have c i am just going to put abbreviations because of time
5 what is a good increment or count by i did not do that okay you need to raise your hand please so that i know that you want to talk by 5 by 5s i am going to start with 0 10 10 15 and 20 no but now between the 0 and the 5 i have i have ones
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and so forth and then i am going to plot and it says to plot what kind of graph i it does not measure change over time
that and usually a bar graph gives you certain categories like for instance if i were to put you we could probably make a human bar graph and just have girls and boys let us do tennis shoes and dress shoes crazy socks no crazy socks
yes for it to be a line graph it could be number of instruments played during the year right okay away and then i am going to review something we did last week really quick cause it is going to help us with our lesson in 2nd grade teachers usually tell you that the is what
right it is a different lesson it is a different lesson it is not the same lesson okay okay i am not going to do the same lesson over right as a teacher you know what i struggle with
control with daily review i have to zip through it and i have to just show you because of time control but i just wanted to review that a flat in 2nd grade i am distracted
okay i am not talking to you again all of you together and you can actually buy a whole candy bar the hershey is candy bar is cut up into pieces right pieces if you already had a chance to look really closely how many pieces is it cut up into
100 pieces 100 pieces depending on how you cut it up that anyone raise your hand if you can tell me what are the 10 parts to that what do you think excuse me
dime this is like tenths ¢10 depending on what you are identifying as the whole 10 there is like 10 parts have yes units and you guys know that some of you had a difficult time though
100 and i identify this as one whole so this tenths and this is hundredths and we used little nerds last week as our thousandths so how many thousandths are in one unit question how many little tiny thousandths are there and remember this is the base 10 system okay how many little nerds would it take to put together to make one unit
10 how many units is it going to take to make a rod 10 and how many rods will make a whole 10 and this is the base 10 system now if i identify the cube remember the cube if i took how many of these together to put together to make my cube how many am i going to need
system some of you are still having problems with that but that is fine sort and with your group and with your teammates you are going to decide what kind of problem is it what are the 4 types of operations when you read a word problem what are those 4 types of operations yes multiplication multiplication is one division division is another addition addition is one
subtraction can you have multiplication and division and subtraction and addition in one problem yes depending on the perception of the reader when i say the perception of the reader depending on how you read it some of you might multiply some of you might add some of you might decide to divide and some of you might decide to .
careful and i am not going to tell you what categories to put this into but i am going to give you a little sort and then we are going to discuss in just a few minutes okay you 2 can work together your partner is going to be your partner go ahead and put these into categories and we will talk about the categories in just a minute
go you 2 work together and you 2 work together do it like this you 2 work together and you 2 work together please put your foot down you are not you 2 working together together i am going to give you a few minutes
there you could do addition and multiplication okay then you decide what category you want to put it in some the product of should not that be repeated addition in
have you guys read each other the problems
are you talking to each other how many pens can you buy with $6 that would be addition it depends
by a factor of 12 21 i am reading it upside down what key word in there tells you what to do factor factor what is right here mean multiplication multiplication which doubles by a show of hands if you need 2 minutes i want to see 2 fingers
finger so let me see your fingers of how many more minutes you need okay i am going to give you 2 more minutes to look through these okay if was separated into equal shares how many please put that away
more okay no more this could be adding okay what did he tell you he told me that i have to sort them by multiplication addition subtraction and division right i guess my directions were not too clear
it pens cost one.25 each how many pens can you buy with $6 raise your hand if you want to kind of talk us through this and what you were thinking what were you thinking division addition or subtraction okay
and explain to me how you would divide because what i see actually here i go again thinking why did you think it could be a division problem because you can divide one.25 into $6
$6 okay or the other way around you mean that you can take the whole and what is our whole cause remember it is whole divided by the part equals a part whole so if i were to take half of a candy bar and multiply it by half of the candy bar i am going to get the
yes and you put it in subtraction subtract i would do $6 minus ¢25 and see how many times i can do it so you would take $6 if i am hearing you correctly and subtract it by one.25 until you can not do it again or how many times you can do it
l well you would use it for addition you would add one.25 and then you would already have another dollar $6 then you have ¢25 left over right correct so you could also add
so it is definitely depending on what you think as a mathematician of how you want to solve this think multiplication what do you think
how can we solve this by multiplication what do you think we can probably solve this by multiplication by timing probably one.25 times 6 $6 because remember if you have one times 6 what do you have
 one.25 so what would be a reasonable number to multiply by 4 4 or 5 right all right category each pair of socks costs one.50 how much will 6 pairs cost what do you think
multiplication because timing one.50 right and you said how much will 6 pairs cost so you are adding more but you are multiplicating more on 6
right and it looks like your partner has something to add to that okay just because the sake of time when you look at these problems it depends on you what like to tell you how to do what with math
they like to show you and tell you you only can do it this way way but you have to have some reading comprehension right huh you have to comprehend what is the question asking you to do groups i have chart paper here and i am going to give you each chart paper
sticky we have not played around with the stickiness before problems you are going to somehow split your paper up into 6 okay down and then as a group you are going to solve as many as you can in about 15 minutes
that let us do at least 2 and then at the end we are going to share our thinking about how to solve word problems it and i will give your team a bag own and i am going to come around and make some notes just to see what you guys are talking about
okay you 4 are working together you 3 are working together you 3 are working together you 4 are working together and you 4 are working together remember one side is sticky okay
it here you go side sticky if you guys would prefer to work on the floor in a circle you can do that yes do not worry about that
class here we go it here you go
please which one do we want to do 1st which one are we going to do 1st well when i think of stuff like that multiplication you guys can pick if you want go ahead you 2 work together
usually if you have someone who is not cooperating you can are you okay guys you guys are a group
no that is not why because all right give me 5 give me 43 great mind if one is easy pick one easy one and one challenging one for you
ahead do you have any more cards over here no they do not want to do hard ones hard ones easy hard ones are easy you guys decide as a group
keep going if you already did it do another one yeah you are allowed to
here let me move this she 5 more how much did she i want you to come around here and stand and i want you to help out
while one person is writing down you want our problems right teacher you want our problems you do not have to write the problem i am sorry in the box or on the paper because we are going to glue them down later sticks i am sorry
all right you guys did repeated addition for that do you have everything you need for your problem on there
missing i think something is missing ¢80 or is this yes a go 0 thank you
over here please are we supposed to glue it yes this one is hard okay then put it right down there and then i want you to okay if you want to write it that is fine but here is your glue
now i really like how each member right here has a spot and is solving a word problem all right how many ways do we have
i was just saying by but you did not have $2 me kara earned $27 karen karen earned $27.75 babysitting she wants to buy that cost $33.98
how much more money does she need to buy 0 i did it wrong and what was talking about was i was trying to subtraction for my problem 484 but i said but if we did not do the division problem i asked her what she got
that is fine all right you have about 4 minutes and then we are going to share at least one of our problems you did all of them were we supposed to do upside down you glue them down the way you want to glue them that is your paper

together or are you working separately yes so you are not sure if you agree with is process how he came up with his problems you check this
what is going on over here problem all right if you are finished with 2 you need to move on to 3 or 4 this i already did that one you guys do it together
find a place and you have to listen 1st this and i want you to stick your chart paper somewhere in the room where we can all see it now and this group right here is the only person that can take the paper the rest of you have a seat please teacher can i no you can have a seat
put it somewhere we can see it like on a door on the side of the cubbies on the desk
me all right when you are finished you can come back to your seat we are not going to get up there
here right there is fine on that on the what do you mean i am going to count to 5 and you are finished
1234 and 5 your attention should be up here cause now i am going to ask some of you to come up here and read your problem and i want you to explain what your thinking was
down find a place like the door that you could stick it on there but remember when someone is talking they have your full attention i do not know what is going on today but that is not what is happening which is fine but i want to remind you that we are going to respect the ones that come up here okay so i am going to have come up 1st because i thought was over here
me no that is ours 0 i am sorry come up here 1st and i want you to read your problem and show what you were thinking my problem was nice and loud my problem was lola had you can explain what it was
word lola had 736 books and she had 4 shelves and i had to find out how many books would go on each shelf so i had to divide and i got 184 division did anyone else do something besides division on that one
v i started to do addition okay and i mean multiplication multiplication why because i was trying to think of another way to do it multiplication i would keep multiplying 4 til i got to 184 here and actually can we clip it on over here cause i do not think it is in view of the camera
and i want to make sure the camera can see okay and then i am going to call on 2 boys here okay i am looking all right go ahead $27.75 and she wanted to buy jeans that cost $33.98
2nd i was over there at the group and i saw that and the whole group was talking this out awesome and then is like 0 i did not see that and tell us what you did 1st i did $30 minus $27.751st cause i did not see that i did not read the problem right okay
$30 you thought what was who is the who in the karen karen i thought that the jeans were $30 but they were $33.98 it i did $33.98 minus $27.75 and she needed $6 more dollars and ¢23 $6.23 and she subtracted
one thing i am seeing from thank you from all your work is what are you missing from your numbers decimal so i really want you to make sure that you are putting that dollar sign
unfortunately we need to go to resource but before we go to resource i want you to turn and tell your partner something that was great about this lesson and something that you kind of did not like about it or maybe was confusing
tell all right and have a seat
here you 2 can come up here actually all right give me 5 give me 4320 i chose these 2 because i do not know why but they were out of their seats so i am going to ask i want to know what did your partner say something that was easy okay
then you both can have a seat it is okay it is okay that he did not say anything but those were my directions he said something but let us have come up because i heard something nice that had said b i said cause i like math because the fact that he is enjoying the sight of your socks
continue cause i like to what was easy about this lesson it was easy because i understand the problem why did you understand the problem besides 0 because i know how to read teacher because i knew what it was talking about and i knew what to do
right but the confusing part was this one that i asked her if it was multiplication or addition but she said subtraction $61.73 and what did get
$6.23 okay and it is probably because of how he subtracted you subtracted the old fashioned way right she subtracted the old fashioned way i like to call it the old fashioned way because that is how i grew up with it this instead of subtracting the regular way what else can you do
yes we subtract by like when you take it away each time and how do we do that b do not forget that we can or take away we could start with our whole and take away parts tables you can leave your material nicely and neatly on your desks
you do have homework and your homework is in your mailbox up and be mindful of what is behind you please this teacher yes just pack up
what i notice is that our group did the most questions yeah that is what did
4342 we did 5 no we did 5 too
all right open up your math journal to page 6767 write that eq on page 67 so we write it on the back of page 66
that s okay teacher are we supposed to put this at 66 yeah that s fine
fine i d like to see you seated right away please we have a lot of math to do or maths like the math s mansion guy would say right if we have time we ll see one of those today too too and she saw the last episode of math shh she better not have told you anything and if she did you better keep your mouth closed she told me a little bit yeah don t talk to them anymore
all right get that eq down and then leave your book at your seat and meet me at the carpet
okay i ll be ready to start in 5 with you joining me but not on a stool unless it s your stool day in 4 yes ma am in 3 why don t you just fold it up and put it away for now it was supposed to be in your 1st draft notebook in 2 go the other way okay
you get up carefully over there all right and go the way did in one i m looking for you to be ready to start j
now so yesterday and monday we worked with those color tiles right identifying different groups of colors fractions of colors okay and you guys i know some of you didn t finish the response we were working on yesterday hopefully we ll have time to get to that and you also worked with fractions in math specials and made that foldable and i guess you were able to fold yours so you had 16 ths
no i had more than that 30 seconds i had 20 okay so what we re going to do today is probably going to pull all of that together a little bit okay we re going to work with an active board file and then we re going to put another type of fraction label diagram in our math journals and we re going to use it to find some equivalent fractions
mister equivalent fraction man tell everybody what an equivalent fraction is
c what are you wearing the microphone that goes with that strange camera contraption before so it s hearing what we re saying the strange camera 0 yeah i guess i shouldn t call it the strange camera contraption when it s recording me right you just said it again 0 how did i do that
all right 0 in on the board for a 2nd we re going to look at some fraction concepts here and then we re going to work on a piece for our math journals okay so here is the 1st concept we re working with and just like the practice that we were talking about had pictures and number lines and numbers this one starts out with pictures
but in this case we re not just matching up a number put your had down for a 2nd we re not just matching up a number we re finding the equivalent fractions okay a equivalent fractions are 2 different fractions that equal the same amount okay do drag the fraction from the box to their equivalent fraction below all right
me i want all of you to look at these pictures and see which equivalent fractions you can match up here just sit down and hang onto that for me
go okay i want you to tell us the fraction that you re going to match up and if you need some help we ll help you all of you should be looking so that you re ready to match one up as well are we doing the shaded or non shaded we re doing shaded
that that s a good point because that last task had non shaded okay don t be afraid to tap it all right so tell us what this shaded fraction is 2 fifths 2 fifths yes
is 2 fifths that s not 2 fifths count them again go 2 sixths 2 sixths so do you think 2 fifths and 2 sixths are equivalent
go anybody have an idea think what do you think out and then i want you to be able to tell us why too okay
because this has 6 and that has 3 okay so what s saying thank you thank you what is saying focus your attention please what is saying is that this did i write it correctly
to . is that supposed to be a 6 that s a 3 sorry that if you agree with look at and say yep yep
all right draw me another stick please teacher huh you need to those fractions because you could just multiply 3 times and divide 6 times 10 exactly it s just multiplication in you say you re supposed to multiply the bottom exactly okay so tell us what you matched up
saying she was talking about multiplying right 66 and when i multiply by 2 over 2 it s the same as multiplying by . 411 remember all right put your hands downs so they can see around you so about going from here
i can t multiply to get from 8 to 4 what s the inverse of multiplication division so what do i do divide divide and what do you divide 8 by to get to 48 divided by 2
8 divided by 2 so 12 divided by 2 is 6 now the other thing to look at is if i could turn this i could make it cover the same direction as that piece right what in every fraction do you multiply or divide by 2 to get equivalent fractions you will multiply or divide but not always by 2 no
in fact in 4th grade we really only have to work with fractions up to twelfths but you can write fractions in as large of numbers as you want and they re not always going to require dividing by 2 or multiplying by 2 m all right come on a drive some fractions around over here put that in your pocket or down in your hand would be good too
he s coming he s just moving slow this afternoon us watch what he s doing because you need to know if he s correct or not us if you want to grab the pen and write anything feel free okay you ve got to grab the pen 1st
0 which one is 2 5 ths with let him get it
stay with us is all right now tell us why you chose that one
green because 4 is half of 10 no 4 is a 3rd of 10 so 4 10 ths is equivalent to . 4 tenths is equivalent to 2 5 ths there you go
d i was going to say something about the last one huh 3 fourths the number over there is 6 8 ths and if you add 2 more that would be so we have 6 8 ths over there and now we have 3 4 ths right yep and if they re both even numbers it seems like dividing by 2 is the right thing to do doesn t it yes all right what were you going to say
i think the one that i did i just look at i would look at the smaller fraction and then i would just take it and split the sections that are not shaded and just split them into 2 and then see if it matches that one okay good thinking good thinking all right let s just see what else we have here hang on we re going to come back to your comments and questions in just a few minutes
okay all right pretty simple question we ve got halves here but the question asks how many sixths equal one half so if it s 6 pieces what s our denominator 6 so everyone should be able to look here and see what the numerator s going to be
at the count of 3 whisper the numerator to me 1230 i heard one and i heard something else divide multiply by 3 i said 3 what are we multiplying by 33 whatever we do to the what do we call it
denominator we do to the numerator numerator so if we multiply 2 times 3 we have to multiply one times 3 so it is 36 yes yes because 3 +3 is 6 i m going to wait for just a 2nd because i have 2 of our friends who aren t with us right now
and 6 -3 is 3 all right and we can drag the 6 from here if you take a look at don t those 3 together yes make one half okay all right take a look at this one
it asks us how many sixths equal 4 12 ths well what is our denominator going to be 66 you can t possibly be paying attention if you re not even looking
so look at that equation pay attention this is what you re going to be doing for a response shortly pay attention look at it decide if you re dividing by something or multiplying by something how many of you say we should multiply divide all right at the count of 3 tell me what to divide by
1232 excellent so 12 divided by 2 is 6 so whatever i do to the denominator i have to do to the . 2 so that means oops write on the block that means when i drag these blocks over how many should i need to equal 4 12 ths 21 there we do
m you could just put 2 because there was 4 that would come up and you could just put 4 like 4 small 2 small put 2 in each so you could just match up the pieces couldn t you
do if you re stumped if you re ever just given the equation and you re stumped by that you could draw the fraction bar couldn t you yes i have a question about a different type of fraction okay i m not sure if it s part of this well why don t you ask and if it s not we ll hold it off until the next time
okay like there s a number it s not the numerator or denominator and the denominator is 6 and the top number is 9 and the top number is 9 and the bottom number is 6 that yeah and then equal it 10 times 9 equals 90 +6
that this is called a mixed number and that s called an improper fraction and that is something that we ll be working on all right let s yeah and you ll see that in here now it s your turn and you need to you can either do the numbers 1st or you can drag the tiles 1st either way works for me please
d you can either drag the numbers or you can tap on the pen and write the equation 1st me yeah and if you need help we ll help you d how many tenths equals 3 5 ths how many tenths equals 3 5 ths what do you want to do 1st do you want to do the tile or the numbers
go and you have that 6 hanging up there where do you want to put that 6 okay now if he s right he ought to be able to drag over how many of those 10th pieces curser pull your legs back you all right let s see if 6 of those match up
with 33 what 15th 3 fifths all right if you think did it oops he s not done he did it right okay he s on the wrong side no it doesn t matter
okay as long as you don t put them like in you could move that absolutely you can up i have a comment yes ma am on the thing we would i m sorry i can t hear you on the thing we would do with the circle you said dividing by 2 is the right thing to do
was i rhyming yes that s the 2nd time today i ve been rhyming and didn t do it intentionally all right we re going to work now with another piece for our math journals and oops hand me that pen please put all the sticks back i m sorry but let me just pull back up that s not it
do you have to before it s retaken yeah if you were needing a retake then your parents would have sent something in today
directions and listen to me i m going to put the document camera up in a minute to do this but i m going to keep class up also on the laptop all right so what you need in front of you in just a minute is this paper look in my direction it goes up and down like this okay and it should look similar to the foldable you made with mister
yesterday so if you re the team s coach come and get this paper from for your teammates make sure everybody has a pencil in their hand all right i ve got 2 teams that are following directions the rest of you head back to your seats coaches thank you
are we watching if we have time we re going to today thank you who s our coach of team one i don t have any paper there you go
all right so you already know what we re going to do with that don t you girl can i do it do it in pencil in case i ask you to do it a little differently from what you re used to okay okay
all right friends huh yeah that s okay now i want you to take a minute and look at the paper
mine but i want you to look at the paper and identify the fraction lines that are on there make sure you have your paper in front of you so that the zeros are to the left and it s kind of like a number line can i put my name on it
huh it s kind of like a pyramid it kind of does look like that doesn t it goes okay now it s working closed we ve got an extra one okay thank you and i want you to label yours the way that i label mine on the document camera okay
okay all right so raise your hand if you can tell me what fraction actually let me ask a different question 1st i asked you to put it in front of you so that the 0 was at the left right raise your hand if you can explain to me what the right side of each of these bars represents d 11 what one whole one whole
so every single bar is that what you were going to say every single bar represents one whole just like yesterday you had one whole piece of paper that you folded and folded and folded today we have the same kind of thing only we re going to label them on separate bars
we re going to do this to work on that eq about what equivalent fractions are all right so look at the very top bar and look at where it s divided because that s what fractions are division raise your hand if you can tell me the label that we might want to use one half i said to raise your hand
right okay all right what would we label one half you ve got to put it under the 1st ball okay so if you re not sure what we re talking about it goes right here okay all right perfect thank you
after you ve written one half look at the 2nd bar and see if you can figure out what fractions are represented in that 2nd bar idea 2 fourths 2 fourths 1st tell me how many pieces the bar is split into
bar let s let answer it here 044 i see one two . 0 i thought you meant like the lines in it that s 3 it s split into how many sections what 13rd 4 thirds not 4 thirds how many thirds make a whole
33 thirds to make a whole right right one here and one here so that s 3 all together isn t it
represent 113rd 13rd the whole bar is 13rd is 3 thirds so let s do this 13rd if i start at the 0 and i all the way up to the 2nd bar 2 thirds it s 2 thirds now i want you to be careful labeling this
some of us learn in different ways we talked about that the 1st week of school so some of us are going to have a little trouble with this just because of the way the diagram s set up and some of you that had an easier time with yesterday s foldable it just depends on how you learn best start looking at the next bar if we had time we would color these and that would make them easier to see too
bar 44 so each one is one . good so the 1st label is going to be tell me 14th 14th and then what 2 fourths 2 fourths and then what 3 fourths 3 fourths 0 i already see an equivalent fraction using these fraction bars
is it s like the 1st one stand right up there and point to it the 1st one is 12 because it had one box then the 2nd one is 13rd 2 box then the 3rd one is 14th okay so he s making a connection between the way the pieces are going down the screen right
s one half and 2 fourths one half is equivalent to 2 fourths they re splitting the bar in the same spot aren t they bar 465 let s count them 12345 so each one is going to be one ..
5th 5th so let s start and label one fifth . 2 fifths 3 fifths 4 fifths 4 sixths and that s it 0 i thought we did sixths you almost made me write a 6 my friend the other one is okay hang on a 2nd all conversation needs to stop
notice i noticed that when you re doing it it never gets to the whole number because it s technically right here because on the right side that s the whole and it never goes up to like it doesn t go up to 4 4 ths or 5 5 ths and it doesn t take up the whole number because the right side it s already a whole for you
that what is this this is one half here what is this it isn t 2 halves equivalent to one whole yes equivalence so what would this one be 33 thirds 13rd equals 2 sixths what s the next one
4 fourths 4 fourths and five . fifths fifths they all equal one whole don t they all right let s hear what wants to tell us i notice that like hang on a 2nd i ve got someone still talking d i notice that it only has half on like every other number every other number
be because the numbers that have it are there s a that has it and a denominator is equal okay and in order for the denominator to be even it has to be divisible by . 2 you just made a connection between all of that divisibility and prime and all that stuff didn t you c yeah don t worry about it right now
d with the equivalent fractions on this all you have to do is add on each up there i m not sure what you mean by that add one to the numerator and 2 to the denominator everybody gets 0 okay so the next set of fraction bars is going up by a digit
notice you could also put a one i could just put a one all the way down there couldn t i absolutely teacher i noticed that every number that s every starts at one half every number that s right down the middle that s going to be to the one half it s going to be equivalent to one half isn t it absolutely you guys are thinking like mathematicians today
chart i m going to finish labeling mine on the ladybug you can either do it along with me or do yours and then check against me okay no don t be me right now start writing i already finished okay then give me a 2nd to do mine so you can see if i m right yes do we have to be all finished with the whole thing finish labeling and then check mine make sure you don t let me make a mistake
i m done excellent then you can see if i have mine right somebody s knocking on the door okay yeah it didn t include a 70 what was that
if you put the number at the right 1st then it s easier to see 0 yeah it just tells me what to use doesn t it smart and then you should get one ninth well can you imagine how big the paper would be if i included all of them
yeah it would be longer it would have had 2 all right finish yours can i do it in marker if i finished it
all right let me why didn t you guys tell me that that was a little blurry is it is whenever she zooms it out
better all right be finished labeling in 5 ready to move on in 4 and 3 put that away and 2 do we write our name on it one there sorry it slid over
now now our original eq today had to do with equivalent fractions right yep you should have just said it had to do with do we re going to use this chart to identify some equivalent fractions
we re going to do one together and you re going to do 3 on your own you already know a set don t you 2nd so pay attention to how we do this
0 pay attention to how we do this because you re going to do it the same way and turn it in okay we re going to go back up to using some tiles too do you were raring to tell us a set of equivalent fractions
m i think it s 2 5 ths and 5 10 ths okay let s take a look at it here she s saying that 2 5 ths which i find right here is equivalent to 4 did you say 4 10 ths fife tenths well when i put the paper there what am i lined up with
4 tenths 4 tenths why does putting the paper there show me something
okay so here s the task based on what said pay attention because this is what you re going to be doing on your own in just a 2nd here s what said she said 2 5 ths equals 4 10 ths correct can we write that on our paper yes right yes can we write that on our paper you can write this one down as an example
into half fifths and the bottom one then i m going to split into what fifths not fifths what s my 2nd denominator tenths tenths now i know that with fractions i have to have even sized pieces but we also know that this teacher doesn t have very good artistic drawing skills yes you do
can so if i m drawing these fraction bars i m going to need to fill in let me get this pen i m going to fill in how many fifths 122 you re not going to know what to do in a minute
2 5 ths and if i m correct and i fill in 4 10 ths they should match right yes okay that i ve written it as an equation and then i m proving that my equation is true by drawing the fraction bars and shading them in question
because the 2 and 10 will it because you can put 2 because you can multiply them both by 2 right absolutely i love how keeps coming back to the fact that you don t need the pictures or the fraction bars you can just use multiplication or division to solve these
d all you have to do is make a but divide it into more pieces under the bigger one and then you just shade in the amount exactly exactly so i my goals you write for me today go erase and get ready to write
j let s listen to the question okay you don t need a to prove it s equal because if it is when it goes down it will line up exactly which is what happened when i put that sticky note over the top of my paper didn t it are you going to turn these all right item number one on our goals is to write 3 equations and prove the equations with drawings
now i used fraction bars if you d rather use circles that s fine to so 3 equations 3 equations and prove with drawings so you have to choose 3 pairs of equivalent fractions from this chart okay and prove that they are equivalent
that i ll fix it in just 2nd and then turn your paper in put it up here no you re going to put it on this paper i m giving you one all right and then item number 2 on the goals board is trim chart glue to page 67
it trim chart glue to page 67 please i need one more piece of paper okay get one very carefully go around behind on this side
when i shade them in you can t see the numbers well shade them in with a light color so i can still see it 0 what if there s has more than one well you can write more than one equation from those then couldn t you can we use markers let s stick with colored pencils or crayons so it doesn t get too dark yeah off that chart please
right let me get my stamp for the teams that are already working and not chatting yes ma am what does it mean like you re supposed to draw with with an equal sign is it s the answer be at your seat please this is one 4th and then 2 4 ths
here 0 okay which ones do we have to do
yeah let me just fix this i have a question would one half equal 22s well one half is here and 2 halves is here
bar so if you re going to do one half you could lay your paper right there and look at all of them that are equivalent to that one i m going to come to your table aren t we supposed to trim these you re on step one on the goals board 1st please i mean i can t do this equations just like i just showed you
do you want that that s exactly what i was looking for paper how are you supposed to do this team 3 excellent job nobody s talking everybody s on task please and you might need to use a ruler to draw those fraction bars
to okay well i gave you lined paper because i thought that would be helpful but you might also need a ruler is yeah that s fine of course i know who that is there now don t forget you re going to draw the fraction bars to prove that okay we do 3 of these huh because when i put on my one of those papers you threw it on the floor because you said you didn t know who it was i think that was maybe i didn t see it
if you need to sure whatever works better for you now then you can use if you use some color that s fine but keep it to color pencil or crayon i m using yeah here let s put that in the center here how about that all right you need to get some equations written now so what s going to be the equivalent i like the way you re using a ruler to see what matches up
yeah that s fine because it might be easier to show it with some color on there all right i m not sure why you don t have anything written yet started huh so find some equivalent fractions and a good way to do that you could take a ruler even and just like go to i don t know go to one 4th
what does one 4th line up with 2 eighths right here let me go ahead and stamp your team s card too you re doing a nice job did nice job over here you guys
so this would line up with the bottom so you re going to draw 2 fraction bars that are the same size and then you re going to show where s your equation yes what equation 2 thirds and okay so you re going to do 2 3 rds here and then the 2nd one you ll draw to the 6th go to my laptop and take off a point
work did you say we had to 33 huh can we do more sure huh that s good yep that looks good let s get something written there it absolutely you re making a 2nd draft of that right
draft huh that was a good way to use the paper right this way and you re going to make a 2nd draft of that right okay does this look good would you get your name on your paper please i put my thing in here go get it and let me see
hun do you have to do all the numbers on the chart you have to do at least 3 pairs of equivalent fractions there s more than 3 yeah but you can t move the numbers all up to 12 absolutely i forgot the next step after this it 1st of all you want your fraction bars to be the same size
so if this is our fraction bar and this we want to match them up okay so if it s one half we re going to split it in half right but if it s eighths we re going to split it in 8 pieces size now shade in one half and then 4 of the eighths okay
you re going to get another piece of paper and you re going to follow directions and it s going to look like a 4th grader wrote it
do all right come on you need to get finished are you good here huh are you okay here yes all right turn that in is this another way to write it way where s your seat
again your fraction bars need to be the same size can i do 5 yeah yeah it could be just a little bit neater
all right if you re going to do this pay attention because you made the same mistake we re going to draw 2 fraction bars -one take care of it so we need 2 fraction bars the same size so that our one whole is the same okay so if this is fourths we re going to have to split it into 4 pieces right
but the other one s eighths so we need to split it into 8 pieces okay so then you draw you color in one 4th and you color in 2 of the eighths and see they ll match up if you have your fraction bars the same size okay all right i m going to add the final task to the goals board okay i just gave myself a point i m doing it
again what page did we put that eq on
67 i know all right turn your attention over here for just a moment please
2 write an answer number 3 write an answer to the eq on page 67 or 68 meaning we wrote the eq on 67 but if you need to go to 68 to show your answer that s fine and then i d like to see that okay i ve got 3 teams doing 4th grade quality work and some i ve got at least 5 people giving me more than what i just asked for on the assignment
up so that s bad or something giving me more than what i asked them for yeah that s bad no it s good 0 it s good are you okay it s good i just lined them all up 0 so you re showing that all of those are equivalent so why don t you put an equal sign between every one of them
it teacher huh is it like this 1234 and then well you want the top one split into 4 pieces and the bottom one split into 6 pieces okay so you might want to erase those lines and draw it again can we use the circle kind for the
me can we do like 2 3 rds in a circle you can do circles if you d rather do we have to do it in color just if it s easier for you to show the different fraction pieces yeah if you can do it without using color that s up to you okay
today i m going to take the blue group 1st deal 1st of all do not move yet
down if you are too noisy i m going to stop centers and we ll do just a whole group lesson at this point in the year we should be able to do centers without me having to talk about the voices
job right hand means you re quietly giving them a warning if they re too noisy go everybody else i don t want fighting over the centers or i m going to assign them
everyone should be where they re going to be for this so we have been discussing
we ve been talking about comparing fractions the last couple of days and we talked about different ways to compare fractions discuss making equivalent fractions and comparing them when you make an equivalent fraction the denominator s the same right in the 2 fractions so what do you have you compare
the you have to compare the numerator right so the denominators are both going to be the same the larger numerator is the larger fraction when the denominators are the same order i m sorry what were the other ways that we had discussed for comparing fractions
about now we have been discussing comparing fractions and putting them in order so when i talked about it i said what was the 1st thing you could do when you have a list of fractions
remember less than and what
half yes greater than one half or less than one half so if you re given a list of fractions you can use any one of those strategies that we talked about how to compare sometimes you can start putting them in order without having to compare them at all
you re just kind of comparing them to one half or some of them you might know their equivalent so you know where it goes today a number line is just that it s a line with numbers the number line that you guys have seen in the past are whole numbers right
like maybe in a previous grade you used a number line to help you add or subtract you look at the number line and count forward count backward not all the time that you ve seen it the number line you re going to be using they re going to have some of them might have whole numbers but if i were to give you a number line that looked like this what kind of numbers are going to be on this number line
fractions okay so why is it going to be fractions on this number line
because there s no whole number that can be between 0 and one right all the amounts i have are less than one so they re fractions or they could be decimals right now if i were to put these fractions on this number line in order where would they go
paper i m going to put some letters on this number line and i want you to put the fractions where you think they belong
match them with the letters are we doing the number line you re going to copy it in a 2nd let me just finish putting these on here there are the letters
i want you to put the fractions where you think they belong according to these letters with 0 and it goes to 11 s bigger than 0 right so the order has to be from least to greatest i don t know you tell me
mine i don t know that s what i m asking you i don t know if i asked you to copy it and you re asking me if it s the same i think you have a problem here is if you re being asked that question on the m test you re not going to say excuse me is this the same as that
question you need to do it on your own and double check your work you re putting the fractions where they belong on this number line do separate them into 2 categories greater than half and less than half right
once you ve done that you can start to look at the individual fractions go in the middle like right here right if one half is what we re using or the landmark it s going to be right in the middle i mean where would one half go on this number line
right so that would be if i were to do this that would probably be the 1st one that i d put on the number line because it s going to help you figure out where everything else goes
one more minute and then we ll go over it
we ll put this here because we know 3 6 is an equivalent fraction to one half
there who s my computer expert wait for to get back and we ll go over it
that s right so while we re waiting for did we divide these into 2 groups greater than half and less than half we know that this is exactly half line so 3 4 greater than half or less than half greater 2 fifths less than
a i took a guess don t be guessing chances are you re not going to make up the right answer reasoning remember on those m tests you have to explain your reasoning right out half of 5 is 2.5 so 2 is less than that right
half same with 3 4 because half of 4 is what than 7 eighths more so one you ve determined that you know which side of the number line they re going to go on belong somebody give me a fraction and tell me what number you think it belongs at
which one b thumbs up if you agree with that it s b disagree where do you think it goes i think one 4 goes okay so here s my question
who agrees with 1st of all that one 4 goes at a this you told me that 2.5 is half of 5 right half so wouldn t you think it would go where b is because that s closer to one half 14th is not as close to one half
so it would be one 4 and 2 5 because 2 5 is really close to being half 2 that s a good procedure to do work i taught you those ways to compare fractions so you re able to do that
picture you could also why are you in the closet what that s why i have a supplies person
it so compared it so let s just compare it quickly so there s no question about it denominator i used 20
by 4 so you have to do that same to the top top 5 20 and 8 20 which is larger
well 3 6 we already know is one 2 left we ve done these now we have 7 8 and 3 4 left tell me the fraction and where you think it goes
7 8 so 3 4 goes here and 7 8 here t thumbs down if you disagree let s look at it them you can t compare them just by looking at them because they don t have the same denominator
so you have to these 2 don t have the same denominator right those do but these are the ones that we re talking about right now them make equivalent fractions again so if you weren t sure this is what you should be doing what can you use as a denominator
okay from 8 to 8 you multiply by 11 times 8 is 8 you have to do that same to the top so 7 7 8 how do you get from 40 to 8 times 2 same for the top are 6 8 and 7 8 very close if you were to draw a picture i don t know that you d be able to tell the difference
strategies so 7 8 is larger than 3 4 so this order is correct
so just some strategies if you re asked to do it on a number line
what if you had a number line that looked like this what can you tell me about this number line it starts with 0 and it goes up to 2 okay so what numbers go here
decimals what s going to go here improper fractions or numbers so yes improper fractions or mixed numbers will go on a number line like this so i have a paper here
we ll do the 1st one together there are some mixed numbers on it one the number line looks like the 1st one
so look at the number line and see what numbers you can put on it right away what 0 and one so it doesn t have to be exact but try to put it as close to the middle as you can
here remember one 2 is between 0 and the okay you can cross out one 2 now we have 4 5 one 5 one 3 10 and one 9 10
numbers between one and 2 so let s leave those alone for now one we already put one 2 so now we have 4 5 keep working a couple more minutes why what do you think
why where do you think one 5 should go before or after one 2 is it smaller or larger than half are you asking me or telling me so it s smaller than one 2
know we were just talking about it how do you know so let s talk about it what s one 2 of 52 not 2 it s between 2 and 3 so it s 2 one 2
so 2 one 2 is half of 5 so basically 2.5 fifths would be half one 2 is one yes so one 5 is going to go somewhere between here h kind of in the middle right so one 5 would be here
4 5 larger or smaller than one 2 larger is it going to be closer to half or closer to 11 how many fifths would be one whole 5 fifths 4 fifths is going to be closer
9 10 they both have the same whole number in front of them which is one at the same time we can cover up that one and just look at the fraction for now so we have 3 10 and 9 10 is 3 10 going to be larger than half or smaller smaller
so what i would do is just put a one 2 here and just use that as our guide 3 10 is going to be smaller and again it s going to be kind of in the middle between one and one one 2 so it would be one 3 12 closer to 2
all right so what i would like you to do before you leave it do the 2nd one and i m going to check it go you can put it if you want to
that looks very good give it to me and i ll check it and that s your ticket to leave
you re cleaning up where you are wait until i call the next group and then you move to the next center
all right so today we re discussing putting fractions in order on a number line we ve been talking about comparing fractions and ordering them for the last couple of days
order what are the ways we talk about comparing fractions equivalent fractions yep compare to one 2 or another landmark 0 or one 2 okay so we re going to talk about using a number line
can anybody think of an example of a place that they ve used a number line before or they ve seen it and what it looked like
here on how many okay so in data and another time is when we did it in what was that called
graph it that looks like a number line yes fractions it s going to look a little different that the number lines that you ve seen before because those number lines usually have whole numbers so today we re using a number line that might look like this that s what somebody else had said
so this number line is between 0 and one whole which means these numbers in between are what fractions right or decimals but we re talking about fractions today so these numbers in between are less than one but greater than 0
so if you have a number line that looks like this and i want to put these numbers on the number line the 1st thing i m going to do is look at the numbers and i m going to put them into 2 categories numbers that are greater than half and less than just to get myself started once you ve done that then you can start comparing the fractions together
before we do that are there any fractions up here that are one 2 or the equivalent to one 2
k remember equivalent fractions of one 2 and the fraction that is the numerator is half of the denominator or the denominator is twice the numerator do you know can you help her out
one 2 where would one 2 or 3 6 go on this number line if this is 0 and this is one middle so 3 6 is equivalent to one 2 so that would go right in the middle so what we re going to do is if you have a one 2 up there i personally like to start with that
you can do whatever you want i just find it easier because you can gauge where the other numbers might go on the number line let s put the fractions into 2 categories greater and less than one 23 fourths is that greater than one 2 or less than one 2
why remember explain explain explain why is it greater because the number the numerator is the same and the denominator is different okay when we re comparing fractions of a different numerator and different denominator we can t compare them that way
be 2 greater i m just going to put a g for greater so we can keep track 2 5 greater than half or less
tricky what s half of 52.5 right is 2 greater than or less than 2 one 2 less than it s less right so that means that it s less than half 14th less than less than one 2
7 8 greater than right okay now we have our 2 categories so we can start to figure out where they re going to go
i m going to put some lines and i m going to leave all the lines here i want you to tell me i want you to copy my number line and i want you to tell me what the letters where the fractions go according to the letters
that s a good question you re the 1st person to ask me that are these going to be in order from least to greatest or greatest to least if they re on this number line
j least to greatest why start at 0 and it goes to 11 right one is larger than 0 so it has to be going from least to greatest is this yeah you should be putting the fractions that are left on the number line
we already put them in 2 categories so you know these 2 are going to be where over here these 2 are less than half and half is here so they re going to be closer to 0 right these 2 are greater than half so that means they re over here on this side going towards the one do you do have to figure it out
do you put the greater on here like add these 2 you have to figure it out we just talked about it
one closer to one raise your hand if you re still working
is it supposed to be or is it
yes okay who can tell me or give me one of the fractions and tell me where you think it goes
j thumbs up if you agree thumbs down if you disagree that one 4 should go by a i don t see any come on let me see the thumbs
paper why don t you have any of your fractions written some of this can be done through reasoning it doesn t all have to be comparing them and doing all the equivalent fractions
8 20 so you know that one 4 goes here so then what s going to go here 2 5 somebody else 3 4 least to greatest we talked about that didn t we if it s from 0 this is a number line right
but you re supposed to place the fractions where you think they should go on the number line it s a number line that starts with 0 and ends with one so it has to be going from least to greatest go ahead i think d is 7 8
why because if you have a picture and 3 4 if you made a picture it would be 3 out of 4 if you made 7 87 would be colored out of 8 that doesn t compare the 2 though same you can see which his the larger amount
that i was going to say i i m going to stop you for 12nd because i want to hold that thought and we ll come back to it 1st this is why i m teaching different strategies because not all the time does one strategy work
work so if we do the pictures and we have now i m going to try to make my circles as close to the same size as possible
7 8 i m doing this as close as i can to being equal without being perfect
close so you should be making equivalent fractions
when you make equivalent fractions and you make the same denominator look how close they are 7 8 so that s why it might be hard to tell if you do a picture and you can t tell just by looking at it so 7 8 is larger so 7 8 would be here and 3 4 would be here
you could but you can t use those during a test it can help you when we practice but not during the you can t have them if you could do that it would be easy to compare right
okay i prefer you be at a table honey
here you are going to need something solid let us see
you need to go back there take everything off your desk except a piece of paper please if you have a ruler take it out
do you have a ruler student do you have a ruler okay would you come on up
there no you come here
me okay
would you go on up student and show us what you have and tell us why you ordered those the numbers like that paper everybody should have this written down
greatest left yes it has to be left you will find out in a little bit okay
put space between them honey so we can tell which ones
up if you disagree thumbs down and if you are not sure thumbs this way what if you are not sure thumb so why do you disagree with this
you mean this and come on up and show us what you thought it was i do not see you writing anything i do not know what to do
the numbers from least to greatest and now why did you think this i thought it was like how you do it in order what do you mean by order
like which one is the least all right and why did you put that as least word ones 0 onsies what is that word how do you say it
this 9 what 9 hundredths 9 hundredths which one is worth the least hundredths this is like 9 times this is like 9 pennies
which one would be worth the least i told you to do something i have not seen that you tried to do it if you have .90 is that worth more or less than ¢9 more then .90 is less than ¢9 no
okay so how would you change that okay rewrite it down there we are still looking at student we did not say yours is not right or anything
all right how many of you agree with this one student s shhh thumbs up if you agree disagree if you do not know this way all right
think okay so we are going to erase this one because shhh fixed this okay in the back eyes are up here
okay now why did you order it that way
we will confuse them if we do not have it colored right why did you order it that way
one how many of you disagree know all right let us look at all 3 now one how many of you agree with this 11 how many of you agree with this one
i feel like a winner you know what yes this is correct think about yesterday we used our centimeter grids
think about if you were to fill out your centimeter grids for each of these amounts head student can you see why 90 hundredths is less than 91 hundredths is .90 less than .91
not you are counting 90 hundredths 91 hundredths 92 hundredths yes
top now we are going to use the red line to begin with we are going to use the blue lines to help us mark amounts on our number line
we will start on the 1st line the 1st blue line top red line on top
okay put it down on your desk and put your finger on the 1st blue line the 1st blue line the 1st blue line there you go the 1st blue line good job good job the 1st blue line
go there you go the 1st blue line like this okay so you are going to use the other side here we go
way the 1st blue line good job that is right there is the blue line the 1st blue line
line shhh the 1st blue line i am going to start a number line for you
spaces you are to fill in the rest of the number line it might not go all the way across yet so right away i do not want to hear i am confused
away okay on your number line you are going to mark the spaces it using your blue line
no i want you to use the red line
you all right i want you to start with .4 and number this is on your 1st blue line
the blue line is the line that goes down student okay across i want you to number your number line all the way to 6 10
like this i do not know what to tell you
fix but you have to number them lines how should we number it it starting in the middle no
end i want you to think i already told you you might not use all of the blue lines today i want to see how you start and i want thinking
here i do not know yet
yet this way
it no think again i have got somebody who is thinking hard shhh sit down sit down shhh
okay i am looking for thinkers i am looking for thinkers
i am not looking for giver uppers you all know how to do this it okay go as far as you can will you solve 0 there is somebody else who is thinking yay sit down
i do not keep going keep going i do not know what i am doing wrong looks good except you should not have put that in there see you should have started here and kept going looks good
i have got some more thinkers you leave the room now teacher no what goes between those let me see
is this right 1st i put a okay
me teacher can i drink some of this shhhh okay student would you go on up there and show us how you started it
do not do all of it but show us how you started it
thank you teacher i love you shhhh we are not talking we are looking
you how about instead of talking you look up there it started one i am running out of erasers
you take the tops off of those and then you do not have erasers okay look at what he did i want the rest of you to finish on your paper
you need to write the numbers write the numbers
okay i need to see decimal points decimal points keep going looks good if you can fit it all in
shhhh please stop this the drink is going to go away if you cannot focus on this
okay i am done good i need to see decimal points good job shhh do the best you can do
keep going keep going all right i have a question for you
this i will wait and then a lot of you went and then all of a sudden when i put 0 there is this value different than this value
it so that when you are ordering numbers and you get tense numbers like this like we had in the example i gave you what do you have to know about that
it is what it tends and then if i have this number how can i tell which one is less than and which one is greater than
that because what no how can i tell that yes student there is nothing we are listening
there is nothing in the ones place and this is the ones place the hundredths place the hundredths place so what can i put there 0 a 0 i know right away i can put a 0 there right
why because counting up to 95 9 10 is the same as 90 hundredths 90 hundredths 9 dimes equals 90 pennies right
that now this is what i want you to do whether or not could fit all the numbers and i want you to take your ruler and draw a line this is what your ruler is for since you do not have a red line in the middle put your ruler on the middle and draw a line
the best you can can shhh
line like this very good use the fold as a helper line there you go
now this time i am going to give you some different digits i might give you tenths or hundredths thousandths no we are doing those awww i might not start with just the tenths
shhh please stop the comments
each line is 100th are we going from least to greatest you are numbering the number line
with do we have the skip these it would be good if you could fit them in better that is good no that is not going to go right there used to be 4 and now it is not
student look now it is not 4 it used to be 4 and now it is 0 very good that is very good all right you got that good try
i am seeing more and more of these now good job good job
marker that was just a marker that is why you ran out of space that is all remember i am just giving you student i am talking to you me i only gave you a marker
you did not have to go and put those other numbers in space 0 so i did not have to put the these i just had to put the right but you put the numbers in between yes see all right that is look i see some good creators i am looking for decimal points
it okay student now think to yourself did i put this this and this on my paper and then tried to squeeze them in no
no this is just to tell you what you had to count through so you could start here and see how much space you have
so student come on up here and number for us please
okay good job
so when you were numbering this how did you think about how to number it that so you counted on right you started with the decimal of 33 hundredths and you counted on all right i have a tricky one for you now
no i do not want to do this one well you are bit expand your brain
line and i am going to ask you what point do you think i am going to say i am going to put some docs on the number line i am going to ask you what point do you think those dots are on shhh this is point a
write down where you think point a is and the value of point a
identify those points
whole thing could be yes
job what do you think the value of b is
82 this is 82
no 81 is there but c yeah 81 hundredths would be a little closer there then okay i am going to take 82 hundredths or 83 hundredths yes
somebody hmmm that is a little tricky because you do not have enough point after 9 100 i know that one student it is a little bit further than 91 hundredths so what do you think
okay so we will take 94 hundredths okay so i am going to give you some numbers
greatest if you are not sure what can you do think make a number line that is why we did this
one all right let us see what you can do
it i want your answer written written down and be ready to tell us why
people at the back table you are making more noise than the rest of us shhh thank you
no you are not looking at tenths or hundredths no
thumbs up if you agree with this okay thumbs down if you disagree
okay student looking for those values now 10th think about where you put this on a number line
it shhh after this you guys are on your own 0 i know it s been a long lesson but keep it together to the end here
shhh but student is 40 hundredths less than 10 hundredths 0 is 40 hundredths less than 3 hundredths okay i m wrong okay think about it
there we go okay good job
all right thumbs up if you agree
disagree student what is it you re supposed to be doing
this 3 hundredths 3 hundredths okay
over i am giving you problems turning it in for a grade
this is supposed to be for a grade we are adding it
i see a lot of as soon as you are done you can take out your writing
bye what are we doing here cause it is easy it is not hard okay okay could you pass that down to her
he was absent he does not have one at all up are you supposed to be in camera then you need to come over here out of the way instead of over here
c everybody should have their sheet okay
up listen up good i have to get you a sheet
okay
once you get your stop what did i tell you i want you to do if you do this right please be responsible and do what i ask you to do it yes because i have given you the once you get your i want to see if you can set them up without me 1st
okay try to set your without me
i am going to give you one in a minute did you get it back just got one okay put it on top of your desk the bag and try your set up
okay i am looking for you to set up
you should not be okay
do got to think a little hard huh okay but wait a minute we are not worrying about colors where are you i am right here where i am on number 8 okay what on that side 14 so where is your 14
14 where are your 14 numbers where is that i do not have a 14 number dice you get 77
i know i do not have to do this we looking for okay then if you are doing 14 then this could be 14 and that take them out these are the number cubes
7 +7 wait a minute 7 and 7 what is that again okay 14 so what do you think okay
so then that means you have to until you wait until this is going to equal to 14 out this is your 14
you are trying to get 14 on that side right yeah so what are you going to name these remember 2 stays the same right so what do you need to name these when you add 2 together is going to equal 14 here 14 here numbers i already see what it is
it 4812 +2 equals 14 see how that worked out 3 where equals 3 and that one equals one that if it is 3 here if it is 3 there this got to be 3 too
that the prime they have to be the same numbers 3 i am going to make if this 3 that got to be 3 and these got to be 3 girls that means you need to go through each one of your numbers 5111 do not work put 2 there that you have to come up with it
that is why it is called guess and check so read what you think it is then you have got to see if it balances you have got to take it your answer is incorrect do you get this that you cannot boys and girls you cannot make this if this is 3 then all of it has to be 3
you can not say i am going to make these 3 and then i am going to make that one you can not do that your prime the prime whatever you name your prime is because your prime is really x but it has to be x on both sides number it can not be one or 2
x but we can not say 10 is the highest number we do not know one okay work boys and girls your job is to go through each number and you are not doing that you are guessing and checking and when you guess and check you start with the 1st number you work all the way down until you get a number that works
there is a number that works for that it is not 12 or 3 so you say it is not 12 or 3 then go to your next number probably 4 yeah do not say probably try to see if it works i do not want you to say probably that means you are not trying to work it on what do you have here it is 4 and stop jumping around number 4 is 4 what number 4 is 4 okay
so if you say it is 4 look at this that is 4 look at me that is 4 and 8 is what 4 and 8 is 12 okay this 4 times what how many of these 4 times 3 is what 12 so that should be what what 4 so therefore what should your check be be 8 equals what did we say just that it was
8 and what 412 so your check is going to be what 12 equals 12 that is right boys and girls i know you think you have to try to think out you have to try them out 4 number 48 equals 88 equals 84 so 4 and 8 is how much
what what is your check going to be 12 equals 12 correct cause you have 12 on this side and 12 on this side okay everybody got that okay where are we
2 +2 equals 44 +2 equals which one equals 4 you got to make check your job is to substitute you are just adding together right now
so one and one would equal 2 then 44 and one equals what it would equal 6 so it is does that work out what is the next one you try out for that
okay which would be a 424 so no they are not the same which is why you got to keep going through it
number okay it has to be 4 because each one of these equals 4 and this okay so what is going to be your check
it everybody see that it is about guessing and checking okay what is this 2 so if i substitute the x for the prime that is going to give me what 2 okay much okay
here you have to do the same thing for here much okay okay you said this is 10 right so on this side that is 2 what
be 3 and what okay 3 and that is 11 so then that is 33 and 3 how much is that 9 is that right no so then you are not supposed to make it up
okay then over here it says we are here 8 and 4 is 12 so what is this 444 okay so your check is 4 equals 4 no
up 12 equals 12 and what is 3 okay go boys and girls remember over your equal sign put a check mark that means you let me know that they check out over the equal sign the middle sign put a check mark the equal sign got that you guys good
2 okay listen i need you to do previous work 1st cause we are going to do this together because that is what i am breaking on for your weekly assessment okay
about you said you are ready to give me this yeah you ready for the end of this you are only going to do previous work 1st you finish i want the previous work 1st
this everybody is finished you all need to listen to me you need to do the bottom only the bottom right now just the bottom okay
cause that is what i am grading okay up i am going to give them the you are going to do previous work 1st okay
make sure your name go on them that is the bottom piece
what 16 right and your x is right which is 6 you can try to set it up now you can try but i am going over there as a group same thing here what is your x
one so you are telling me that x is 6 so that is 666 right much it would be 18 equals 18 it your check needs to check out too boys and girls you understand not just getting your x
it this right here you are going to do with no sharing cause this is graded that bottom part no that means you do not do the top together we are going to go over it as a group yourself no sharing information okay that means you are on your side
you too no sharing information you are at the bottom that is what you are doing 0 you previous work
on so what do you have here wake up what do you have here i am doing number 8 you doing what
okay it is 8 so what is on this side on that side is you are already looking at it
that start guessing and checking you are not doing they need to know it is 14 here you are not doing any guessing here
1st i did not put a number start putting a number there in your mind what number would that be be that would not be right that would be 123 okay be 246 then be 12 this is not multiplying you are adding so where do you get that from
adding you are wrong here then because you are trying to multiply that you are adding this boys and girls time out understand that you are adding anything you understand that so do not multiply
if you have 10 and 4 as your numbers you add them you do not multiply them so you need to go back because i can see you have a problem you got this and then you go down here and change it is 2 is x is one okay 1234 i can see that so if you added here what makes you think it is supposed to multiply down here that is not how that works
you need to go back and change that okay and add them you are adding these but not multiplying them we are adding them you are doing the bottom only and you are doing it by yourself not with a partner done huh i just need to do the last one okay
so what do you have on this side okay side what are you going to say did you replacing it with 2 i if you add 2 to 2 and one that give you
14 okay what that is 246 would that be the same no so that means you need to count up with the next number what is the next number going to be 3 so if you add 3 to 12 what would that be 1515 so 3 and 12 is going to be 15 right yeah okay so on this side you got 333 so what is that going to be
9 so 9 to 15 are they equal no so then what are you going to do next do 4 okay 412 and 4 is what 16 huh 1612 and 4 is 16 right okay so then you are going to have 444 what is that going to be 12 okay
no then you got to keep working til both sides are equal you done yet 15 you said x is 5 so that is 12 and 5 is how much 17 okay
say excuse me i said no sharing and that is what i meant so why are you having a conversation you should not be and you are listening okay fine i am not checking now
now then we are going to do the other one as a whole mouths just hold these sheets now okay
grade name needs to go up here
important so you said x is one yeah so how is x one
so if x is one that means each one of these primes is replaced that an x so that is 123 and that is the same thing 567 equal how is that equal this is 7 over here what is this over there what is that over there 7 where is 772 no
if you make x one x is one on both sides x is not different on this side boys and girls know whatever you make x if x is one on one side x got to be one on the other side if x is 2 on one side it got you cannot change it to make it work for you it so you can not make it work for you
if you say x is 2 then x is 2 everywhere x is not different somewhere else the prime that you have the little black this little thing right here these right here represent x okay okay so if you say x is one on one side of your scale x must be one on the other side of your scale
check in other words you are guessing with the prime to come up with a number that you are going to have x for you just do not change it because that is what you feel like doing because it is not working out for you okay it is guess and check it called that means try the numbers
2 if 2 do not work try 3 until they come out to be the same now why you say that where did you get that answer from so that means when you add these that is a 7 that is a 7 and there is 5 what would that be
19 okay be cause if it is not the same if it is not coming out the same thing you are not correct
okay you need to do previous work me i need you to come on and finish this because you need to get this done check not yet
part get focused and ready to look at the top part with me so i can get you going the check is 12 and 12
huh okay
okay work top part you need me to take them i want you to use your primes to set this up
the 1st one says 2 x equals x +3 when they said 2 x they are talking about 2 times what are these called primes i am waiting on you
x these are 2 x is and then it is equal to x so this will stand for x +3 on your paper
is yes even if you finish because i told you go ahead this is 2 x is
you need to keep these cause i can did you and go back and substitute your x is so you had 2 and you had x so you made 2 and 3 okay
let me ask yeah in this case it is multiplying that changes it a tad bit so 3 times 32 times 3 and then you have a 3 as your x
okay did you do the same thing huh on what
x 4 x equals 4 x where so you had a number for an answer why are you looking at me
x should not that be 2 x now try to substitute now what you say your x is
be huh 53 so we are going to 4 times 3 is what 1212 then we got 3 and 3 is what 6 +28 and then you go the +6
14 that is too much cause you got 12 over here and you got 14 over there did you start off with one
up 3 x +4 that would be 2222 +4 equals 6 this right here 3 x would give you the number 3 plus that
so it would be 3 times it would be 3333 equals x +4 but you say you had 62 you are looking at this one now
what 3 and what the number times 3 times x okay i see your check there you see what i am saying you multiply 3 times the number you see what i am saying you take it multiply 3 times these numbers so if you have like this it is more like this it is telling you to take this and multiply the number times of x
we have got 3 times x like this 3 times that then this right here that is your 4 together so if you multiply he made x is 2 so if you multiply 3 times 2 you are going to get 6 then over here you take 2 and add it to 4 you get 6
check let me see your next one
42 x +3 so then you got you say your x is one so that is 14 that is 567 how many is that that is 12 equals 5 huh wait a minute what 12 that is one that is 11 +one equals 2 and 2 +3 equals 5 okay
okay i need to see it like that so that is 12345 and then you got what was that one and 4 is 5 yup you are right that means that is how many times that is going to be
one okay x i do not get it you at the top no i am right here i am trying to figure out make sure it is right
2 x equals x +3 this is your x +3 you are saying your number is 3 okay if your number is 3 like you say it that is going to be 3 and 3 that is 6 and what is this that is 3 and 3 is 6 okay up 3 x you need 3 x equals x +4 over there all right so then you got what
you say your x is 2 so 246 right 2 +4 is 6 okay you are right that is right let me see that one you are adding what is your x your x is 2 i keep on thinking that you are multiplying that is an x what is this one right here what is that one
okay so you got x +4 on that side 4 goes on that side like this x 2 x +3 number 3 where is it where is number 3 all right so you said what
okay so you got one and 4 is 5 then you got 12 and 3 is 5 yup 14 x equals 2 x +6 let me see your 4 x so your 4 x is going to be 4 primes cause there is 4 x is
then on that side let me see 2 x +62 primes and a 6 make this number 6 number 6 right here are you copying off me paper you should be looking at your paper over there okay what do you have right here you are saying that is 3
right well why you if that is 3 that is going to be 3333 okay then you have 3 and 3 is what 6 +612 so what is your check 12 equals 12 bingo your check remember to do your check over your equal sign you done
okay where is i did that wrong where is your 2 x at your 2 x should look like this 2 primes and then on this side you got x +3 like that
that 63 and 3 is 66 so you know that if this is going to be 2 x that is 3 and 3 is 6 okay what 6 so you check is going to be the same thing so what you going to get already let me see your 3 x set up and x +4
do the same thing what are you going to substitute there what is the problem i am done with this you done with that one i need the other sheet i got to get you the other sheet hold on
s the bottom yes the bottom 1st finished put the problem did you do after you did 5 did you do 6 yet is what is 10 and 212 and then add 6 to it
16 what 17 add it again 18 okay
18 so what is this on this side you said each that is 6 so what is that going to be 66 +6 is how much what would that be check 6 plus your check
18 equals 18 all right now what is your x 6 all right part this is for a grade right here same thing we have been doing the whole time previous work no you could not have found a triangle i am not going to tell you because of the check but you could not find it with a single number if you tried every single number you would come up with the answer so you have tried one
2 yes let me see you try them one is 7 right here one is 4 right there okay now try the next 12 is here you all must be finished over there because we have a lot of conversation so you can go ahead and put them in your bag if you are done okay and make sure they do not fall on the floor
7 is right here 9 is right here okay 1336611 okay
that is 6 and 5 is 11 do the other side that is 10 okay try 4814 so that is 4 and 4 is 12 right +512 and 5 is what 13 what is 12 and 5
12 and 5123 you all better get yourselves in check graded 4
555 what 1616 try 6 cause it works 171516 what is 16 what is this right here
that is 6 and 6 is what 12 +5 is 17 okay you have 666 what is 6 times 3 that is 18 +one is 19
okay so we re starting our math okay so you guys we re doing like a regular math today
looking up on the chalkboard looking up on the chalkboard is something you worked on yesterday something you worked on yesterday
can someone say what you see up on the chalk on the board on the from yesterday so what do you see i see paper with the thing we were doing yesterday like seeing how many cubes can fit in the box teacher so i hear someone saying 2 things or 2 vocabulary words jumped up cubes
box okay what more can you say nd like like he said about the cubes in the thing and the box and on the other side on the pattern on the black paper it has the numbers of the teacher are the numbers of the cubes that are in the box
a i see i see 3 boxes 3 patterns that you can do to see if how many cubes could fit in one box box there are patterns that we know were cut out and taped to go in these boxes
a eah it s like for example yesterday we in our we were filling up the cubes and like the geography will like well we put it in
we figured out by counting how much are in each side and it by common sides teacher so do you you multiplied numbers
k like the that actually we were putting them in the bottom of dimensions the 2nd layer and we were adding up the 4 sides so then we can know how much to put on the 1st layer so then we could use the same number on the other layer and teacher so i hear 2 words in there
you have and volume and volume meaning how many cubes are in the box as said earlier e e were trying to figure out what was the volume of the box teacher figure out what the volume of the box is okay so boys and girls today we re going to do something similar
it we re going to some kids anyone want to take a guess on what we might be working on today ubic unit teacher so we re working on cubic units in other words cubes or we could say cubic units
k ow much are going to we re going to work on box types like how much is going to be in each box teacher hm how many in each box so we re going to be working on how many cubes in a box which is volume
please open your math books to our goal for today please write down the word objectives
mission write that down
yes please put this in your notebook teacher my goal to create a model with cubes
or i heard someone say another word yesterday or even this morning boxes just like we used the earlier what type of box hree d teacher 3 d 3 dimensional box
3 d nd have different things teacher yeah so that s going to be your mission today it is very much the same as yesterday except today you re going to make models with the cubes to prove you know the volume of the boxes
yesterday take a look at page 7 in your book
so page 7 if you look at the 1st 2 patterns the 1st 2 patterns teacher you can see there s a pattern and you can see there s a picture in those boxes of those boxes
there s also a little column it says 1st answer and actual answer nd also we re going to right teacher was saying we re going to estimate or we re going to take our prediction of how many you think will fit into the box
so right now please for number one please look at number one and please write down your 1st answer which is sort of like what i heard say your estimate or it could be your prediction so number one and then take a look at number 2
else s there s no wrong answers because it s your prediction or your estimate of how many cubes will fit in that box so we could do a 2nd one too teacher yes one write down what you think your 1st answer means your prediction or your estimate
s student teacher you have to kind of scoot your chair over a little bit student teacher 0 well get in a minute thank you okay so your mission is those patterns are up here
copies i have the 1st pattern number one from page 7 i have a pile for page 2 for number teacher one student at your table i know we kind of redid jobs since we moved people around one materials person is going to come up and get one copy for your table of number one and one copy of number 2 and also get one pair of scissors for your whole table
ne per group teacher yes one per group team what i d like you to do is if you make a box if you make the box and then you figure out how many cubes are in this i might ask you to prove how you know how many cubes i want you to find different strategies to make models with your cubes to show what the volume is to show what the volume is
j student teacher no we ll pass them to you we ll pass them to you question teacher so you re going to make models with your cubes if you find one strategy we different strategies yesterday you re going to find another 2 you want to find our goal is to find different strategies multiple strategies okay how about and we ve got will you grab those for your table please
and would and would you grab the materials for your table please
5 thank you another letter in my can someone tell me what your mission is real quick too
can someone tell me more

yep so now just like yesterday fold them
me i want to put 3 more minutes because there s 2 tables i haven t got a chance to check in with 3 more minutes to finish one and 2 finish one and 2
we re going to talk about how you proved the volume of these boxes let s see i see 123 tables ready i see 4 however we re waiting for one student
teacher good 5678 okay so boys and girls and can i ask and turn your chairs please this way you can t go up to the so let s start let s look at number one boys and girls let s look at number one
i m going to ask a few kids to come on up if they can to share how they prove how many cubes are in number one we all figured out let s just put it up there what was the what was the volume of number one s ixteen 16 cubic units teacher correct
16 cubic units okay so 1st would you mind kind of coming up and showing the class the you have please so i notice students with their counters down
you can do i want you please pay close attention to the model that you made to prove the volume went with my number was 16 because i did 4 times 4 and because there was 4 going up and 4 going across so then there was 4 times 4 equals 16
arranged can you hold that up so we can see it how it shows so i see it that way i noticed before you had it turned vertically so how would you know that how could you count that one efficiently orizontal and vertical teacher okay excellent so he has his that way or both ways i guess
next you show how you proved number one please or s team
teacher so i heard you say 3 numbers
here one by 4 times 4 boys and girls what do you see what do you see in s model that shows that 1st one by 4 what do you see in s model that shows that 1st one by 4
do me this favor please i want you to know this one because we re going to get to why there s 3 dimensions turn and talk for at least 30 seconds where is the one by 4 in s model 41st where is the one coming from in his model hold it up again and show them turn and talk for 30 seconds where is he getting one times 4 from
30 seconds please to think where s he getting . teacher 10 seconds please teacher okay that was a few seconds more than 30
okay finish your last sentences please turn up to the front please turn up to the front could someone would someone mind telling us where was the one times 4 k ne times 4 because just one strip so it s just one times 4 times 4
it you said the one times 4 going up 4 the one times 4 going up what more
ell i think with the where he got the one from is the side of it because you see that all it is is a straight a straight going up
so i think that s where he got the one and then the 4 right here and then the times 4 is here teacher and the times 4 so you said the one comes from the one strip going up going up the ones what did you say
column
teacher one strip times 4 so one strip going which way
vertically up and down or horizontally side to side ertically teacher you said vertically vertically did you want to show the model you made
you up all the green and white . so now if you pulled that down so we can see the colors maybe
teacher now boys and girls take a look at s model please 4 where is that one times 4 think that one strip was it one
color ne part green like one teacher that reminds me of what said earlier parts do you want to say what it was eah i said that it it looks like it s a sided building with 3 floors and inside is a teacher ah
one does that go with s boys and girls does that go with s yes teacher because how could his be like a building how would his be like a building aybe because it s 4 stories teacher 4 stories what do you see that makes you say there s 4 stories
ecause there s 4 layers here and if you put it like this you see there s 4 strips going down teacher okay so you see the 4 layers one white and a green is that what you re saying
else his is one floor with 4 that s how i got one by 4 times 4 4 teacher one times 4 times 4
excellent thank you okay next to number 2 guess what word came up hree d teacher 3 d 3 dimensional did you i didn t you to go 1st but do you mind sharing what you have how you counted
that go ahead if you do this is s strategy for number 2 look just timesed the teacher come on up hold it
there en i think yeah 10 teacher student teacher you all want to come you by the way boys and girls what is the we all know the we all determined the volume
r hirty cubic units teacher 30 teacher girls come on
okay find out a different way than everybody else but i found it out since on the side it s and going across it s 5 so i did 6 times 5 teacher 6 times . can you say well what did you ..
2nd boys and girls had a strategy i m trying to figure out wha how he did this
hand teacher so can you help me try to figure out this kind of this is a mystery to me right now he always comes up with great strategies here what do you see that could have made him say 6 times 5
what do you see on here that might have made him 6 times 5 and i ll hold it still what do you see that maybe made him say 6 times 5 please turn and talk for like 20 seconds what do you see that maybe made him say 6 times 5
0 for that okay ive times 3 teacher can you can you put that up there please
2 teacher so boys and girls what do you on his model where do you think what do you think saw that said 6 times 5
down he said there s 2 columns of 3 which makes 6 so times and we have 2 students have eyes up here teacher he s saying that 2 groups of 3 makes 6
you don t look like you re a . student lazy eyed teacher so you re saying . is this what i hear you saying every time i grab 2 there s 2 groups of 3 so there s one there s one group of 62 groups of 63 groups of 64 groups of 65 groups of 6
all right so i have so i have this question that i need boys and girls we re getting we re kind of getting to the end for today
an we do like a teacher so he said 6 times 5
here we all ready know from yesterday and today it s not 2 numbers 3 d so we know there s said
height teacher length width and height so i m kind of wondering how do figure that how then work did a strategy that worked today he made a model 2 groups of 6 and explained it to me and that worked but that s 2 dimension still so how is how what are the 3 dimensions and does that work
i want to write a little exit journal so number 3 on page 8 . so please write down 3 times 4 times 3 and we know 3 times 4 help me think of what is the what is the 3
3 times 4 makes 12 students 12 times 3 equals 36 teacher 36 am i going to hear you talking like the whole . thank you
like this is something we re going to get into tomorrow you can try to draw a picture of it it you can explain it in words or make a model today i think you boys and girls i think you ve got this thing you made the models prove how many cubes were in there but tomorrow 3 dimensions 3 dimensions why not 2 dimensions or why not 4 dimensions
teacher so what would a 3 times 4 times 3 look like an we like teacher please take 2 minutes 2 minutes or so write down what you think it would look like or draw a picture to go with it s ind of like i was thinking about adding 4 times 3 together and then like whatever that equals and then like put 3
teacher so you re saying adding 4 or times 4 m hm 4 times 3 teacher 4 times 3 and then next you re saying . dd the 3 like teacher hm
it teacher yeah absolutely see if you ve got f you ve got 4 across and then h missus
s can t make a 3 d object teacher someone thinks he s cracked the code all ready did i know i did student 0
i know i did teacher hey we ve got one minute to go i d like to just hear from a few boys and girls who think they can explain what 3 times 4 times 3 would look like
let s start off with please think like the sides are 3 and then in the front there s 4 rows with 3 squares in each teacher 4 rows with 3 squares in each okay i see tried m going to show him teacher you could quite very well be correct
next nstead of the box why do you know what i found out that since 9 times 4 is 36 since there are 2 3s 3 times 3 is 9 so then you could times the 4 which is there and then the will be 36
01 or 2 more one or 2 more and then think it would look 3 on one side 4 on the other side and 3 on another side teacher 3 on one side 4 and then 3 eah teacher okay
k i would say there would be 3 on this side 4 across here and then 3 going down i know 3 columns teacher so wait time i don t want to say here s 3 down so there s 3 here on the on the teacher 3 going which way
layers es teacher like said 3 layers hree layers then there s 4 then there s ome on man our cubes across and then 3 on the side teacher okay i don t know you know what i know of you found words but we ll have to wait until tomorrow to find out ho was the closest teacher you ll have to wait until tomorrow e
was teacher go ahead
all right thank you
night just put it right here take out your math homework from last night just be ready to go over it okay with your elbow partner i want you to compare answers if you got the same answer check it off
if you all got different answers i want you to go ahead and highlight that or put a star by it and then we ll go over on the board some of the questions you had ahead i m going to give you about 10 minutes to compare answers go ahead and compare answers
homework you are comparing answers with your elbow partner over here nice if you got the same answer you re going to put a check by it if you got a different answer the 3 of you here 2 there
answers put a star by the ones that we need to go over on the board very good
answers the 3 of you here this the bottom number is how many pieces the whole has always been divided into if we said one of 8 pieces how much would you shade on there
one then one of 10 that s going to be what 10 if you re comparing them which is the larger fraction 18th or 110th if something is being cut into 8 pieces and something s been cut into 2 pieces which would you rather have if you were getting a piece of cake or something one of 10
10 the bottom number is how small it s getting divided let s say i handed you a birthday cake i cut and then there s 2 birthday cakes sitting on the table and i cut one into 8 pieces and then i cut another one into 10 pieces and then i say okay which piece would you rather have one of these 8 pieces or one of the 10 pieces which one do you think would be a bigger piece one out of 10
well 10 is going to be cut into more pieces so each piece is going to be what smaller larger if it s more pieces it s one whole like a piece of paper if i fold this paper into 10 pieces okay then if i fold it into 8 pieces same sized piece which one is going to be the bigger piece the one folded 8 times or 10 times
8 8 right so the top number is the same here so you re going to want the one of 8 because the less pieces it s divided into the bigger the piece 10th you re going to shade that that s right 3 ninths is less than 3 sevenths because that s divided into more pieces
back okay any questions over here okay good so what would you think why were you thinking the 6 tenths was less than that
yes that is a little bit more difficult but here you could have used this you have to kind of think to your mind if something s been divided into 8 you can t make an equivalent fraction in this case it s almost like you have to start to be able to visualize pieces
if something is going to be a piece that s going to be larger than a 6th but smaller than a 3rd you might have to your top number might have to be a larger piece how about like something that s larger is a 5th larger than a 6th 15th yes is that going to be smaller than a 3rd though
yes again the bottom number is how many pieces it s being divided into okay so 15th is definitely larger than 16th because you have let s say a pie and it has been divided into 6 pieces or 5 pieces right if it s been divided into 3 pieces you re going to get an even bigger piece means the reason it s hard is you have to kind of think of a number like a 5th now one of one is a whole
anything over itself if i have a cake and i cut it into no pieces that s one over one whole but if i take a piece of paper and fold it 6 times 2 4 this can be 8 8 times and then i fold it into 3s you ve got to find one over one is the whole
whole one over here would be how much 6 yeah if i have something i divide into 6 pieces i give you 6 i don t give you all of it right if i give you 5 sixths that s going to be part of it 12 thirds we know that s over half right so i would pick a number between this and this
greater you can do halves okay half you can make an equivalent fraction there right e what do you already know about this
no is this a whole yes yes so automatically this is going to be greater yeah good any questions for this part i put ask for help okay good now the thing is we ve got to label it so you can see what they re saying
use this as a guide to order these okay there let s come back together i want to was there any on the front that was anything the front was that pretty easy
if you turn it over on the back i think most of the shading you re getting the idea that the bottom number is the number of pieces it s being divided into and the top is the part of the whole okay on 4 you needed to probably in some cases make equivalent fractions but in a lot of cases there were improper fractions comparing them so that s always over one okay
let s skip to 6 because that was really the one that was a little more unique basically they ve given you a model here and remember our fraction bars that we ve worked with
one that would be like putting one red fraction bar and this was 2 the 1st one was divided in it s 0 one has one bar so it s been put into how many pieces 2 so this is actually one half because the bottom number is the number of pieces it s been divided into
whole so this over here is actually one and we re moving towards 2 so it would be one and what good if we continue to go on we could have 3 and this in between here is 2 and 2 halves and so on okay
now the next one that they show again is 2 wholes okay you ve got a 0 you ve got your one and you have your 2 but it has been marked off into 3 sections so those are what s my bottom number one section 2 sections 3 so these are thirds okay
so this is 13rd this is 2 thirds and this one is the same as 3 thirds anything over itself is a whole because i ve given you the whole thing or you ve put it s like breaking apart or putting it back together
then this is one and 13rd this is one and 2 thirds this is one and 3 over 3 which is the same thing as 2 and if we converted that to a mixed number it would give us one times 3 is 3 +3 more so this is the same thing
it now they gave you another one now you ve got 0 you ve got one and you ve got 2 okay if now how many pieces has it been divided into the bottom one
5 exactly so in order to make 5 sections you only make 4 marks because that makes it one section 2 sections 3 sections 4 sections one 2 3 4 excuse me one more
tough one 2 3 and 4 what 15th this is 2 fifths this is 3 fifths this is 4 fifths or 5 over 5 which is one
thing i m going to make 4 marks one 2 3 4 which is going to be this is one and 15th one and 2 fifths one and 3 fifths and one and 4 fifths and this is the same as 5 over 5 which is the same as 2
now in order to make this easier i like to really work it so i would start on number a or letter a of number 6 it was 13rd 2 fifths 2 thirds and if you just started to look at those numbers it overwhelms you but that s why they gave you this
off i already said one half one and one half so then i would put my well one half what do i know if i m going to order them less it said order them least to greatest 5 so which is the smallest part of all of these if i m comparing them here
15th so here s your 15th and i would mark that off and with the next box 13rd then one half then what s the next one
we go look at thirds and fifths this is 2 thirds and 4 fifths 2 thirds and 4 fifths yes 0 yeah sorry so it s 2 fifths then 2 thirds
more than a half right because half of 5 would be 2.5 but is 2 thirds over half here so it s going to be 13rd one half but then what 2 fifths and then 2 thirds good
then on the 2nd page what did you notice about the top numbers on b what do you notice at the top of the numbers the proportions look at b on 6 they re what improper yeah they re over a whole so your improper fraction you know what side of the chart you would be working on you would start with ones and go to 2s okay
let s skip to number 7 a lot of people have questions about that here you could have maybe made an equivalent fraction right thirds 2 thirds 2 thirds okay but really this was the hardest one because you had to start to understand and see this in your mind okay
if i had a 6th and then a 3rd a 3rd is going to be broken into 3 pieces but i would use this as a guide too if i have a 5th and this is a 3rd is a 6th going to be broken into even more pieces than the 5th yes so it s going to be even smaller okay 5th is it going to be smaller than a 3rd but bigger than a 6th yes
so you could put 15th in there okay b just give me a what did you get for b thirds we know that is over a half
okay if we were dividing something into fourths you have 3 of those fourths does that mean it s going to be in smaller pieces but it s 3 of those okay then 7 eighths 7 eighths is almost a whole right estimate it s like visualizing and using estimates
away we re going to do a lot of group work today
so with your table right now you guys can work through using all of our answering the questions then the write it solve it prove it the same thing because that answers our questions
there let s talk through this together at 1st and then you ll break into your groups
c mary mary quite contrary has more than silver bells and taco shells in her garden these days she has gone to and is growing cabbages beets corn lettuce and tomatoes she has arranged her 9 prize winning cabbage plants in a straight row with 3 plants in each row what does mary s cabbage patch so what are they asking you to do
is it going to be a t chart or a graph rows it s going to be like a garden it s going to be like an area and we actually have been working on rows you know when we have the dots and we have to figure out the fractions
an array exactly so when you re looking at that and it s saying row in each row she s got columns and rows like she s got she s got 8 straight rows but how many things is she planting
3 in each row then she s got how many she s got cabbages beans corn beets lettuce and tomatoes so how maybe things is she growing rows they haven t given us the 9
things so i want you to work with your group answer the questions and draw a picture of what you think her garden is going to look like and be creative with your colors and all and i ll be walking around to help you you re going to be working with your tables today just your tables today
okay so you guys go ahead and talk about what question needs to be answered and can you stand up one more time and move so the camera can thank you go ahead it did get quiet
down what is mary mary quite contrary what is she doing these days making a garden yes she is growing a garden for a business garden how many cabbage plants does she have
it says she has cleverly arranged her 9 cabbage plants in 8 straight rows with 3 in each row okay all right what is she trying to do plant a garden and we ve got to try to figure out what that looks like usually gardens are in a square or an array
she has 9 prized cabbage plants in 8 straight rows with 3 plants in each row across so what is she doing these days have the answer is 9 right
them in do the questions 1st because that will get you to thinking what it should look like 9 they re in 8 rows them how many cabbage plants does she have she has 9 right how does she arrange them
rows they re trying to get you to think 8 times 9 exactly answer your question 1st answer what her garden looks like
that good quite contrary that s like a nursery rhyme what is she doing these days right is this 6
have she has cleverly arranged her 9 prize winning cabbage plants so how many plants does she have 9 then it says how she arranged them it says she has arranged them in 8 straight rows think remember rows are going across
exactly okay it s mighty quiet over here rows when the strategies you know about don t seem to work what should you do next
what a different strategy that s a good answer you guys answer questions that s true but you ve got to draw the cabbage patch strategy right now they want you to talk about it 1st
problem are you saying it s kind of rows and columns because they don t really say there s columns but they do say there s 3 plants in each row so that automatically kind of tells you that there s columns right because you know there s 9 what rows so you might start to think in your mind can you kind of see
right then can you kind of see in your mind what 3 plants which is almost 3 columns correct okay plants if there s going to be 3 in each row you could do them long ways like a rectangle or more of a square
no yes i would say so because otherwise they would overlap and she wants to know how many she has
okay there s but now she has 9 plants though do you need beans corn beets lettuce and tomatoes that s not important no because they re asking you what how many cabbage yeah with 3 plants in each row what does mary s cabbage patch look like
so you did 3 rows and then 3 in each row and 3 columns 8 okay what did you do
8 exactly so how can you start to think about what it s going to look like 8 then we automatically kind of already know about the columns they don t come out and say columns but they say there s 3 in each row so that s going to create a column that you want to go ahead and start to look at what that looks like
have you answered any of the questions for math you need to use pencil erase did you answer your question that then so i would go ahead and make my rows
out i think you guys are getting so i m seeing looks on your face but i think that you re getting so good at this that you re expecting it to be harder than it actually is 9 3 because there s 3 in each then there s 8 do we really need beans corns beets lettuce and tomatoes yes no no because she s asking about her cabbage patch
grouping you know how you can take a garden and plant this way usually that s what they do together they have a patch of one thing then a patch of something else so go ahead and finish what that looks like so you need to draw a picture how many rows
8 rows go across right you should be at the picture part now do we need the information about the beans the corn the beets the lettuce and the tomatoes no
because usually when you plant a garden do they intermingle different plants within there or do they kind of have a section of one thing a section of something else so really that s irrelevant information that so what we know is there s 8 rows and rows go what horizontal so i would go ahead and draw those and then she said there s 3 plants in each row
3 3 because they didn t come out and say columns but if there s 3 you kind of separate those right so they don t overlap in a garden go ahead and draw what that s going to look like and like an array exactly rows good way your rows are horizontal so how many are in each row though
9 she says she has 9 prized cabbage patches in 8 rows with 3 plants in each row
so she s arranged 9 prize winning cabbage plants in 8 straight rows are we supposed to draw it
how many you re on the right track how many plants does she have all together 9 i have she has 9 okay and she says 3 rows
so i think we were thinking 8 straight rows with 3 plants but that s actually how she said she set up her garden so it s really 3 together so the rows she has 9 plants all together and she has 3 rows like you see what i m saying
it says she has arranged her 9 prize winning cabbage plants in 8 straight rows with 3 plants in each like i ll show you kind of the visual here this so 3 times 3 is 9 3 rows
okay i think the question was a little bit misleading because they talked about the straight rows but there were 3 plants and 9 all together so 3 times 3 is 9
understand it s 8 times 3 so 24 all together all right you ve got okay good you would start to do it you ve got 3 rows and you would start to put them in groups of 9 so 24 all together you ve got the hang of it
good all right put that in i know we moved fast another strategy very good put those in your journal or set them to the side and pull out your problem solving from yesterday that you were working with a partner
we have 23 students so that was an odd number anyways so why don t you just hop on board with s group and you can get some insight into that okay so take out your problems on a little strip of paper come get some chart paper and i m going to give you about 20 minutes most people already solved it yesterday and i ll be helping you and right now you re just putting it on paper right
then you re going to teach the class your problem okay how to solve it already if your group already did do you have the copy of your is that yours go ahead paper it s a little strip of paper with the problem
here it was groupings like 3 and 3 so 9 i think it wanted you to say you have a group a group a group so it would be 24 yeah okay
do you need paper paper you can work on the desk table you can use any of the back tables use the table here s your paper you can use other people s groups too
paper how about do you have a partner yesterday you re with then that would be good okay so do you think you re you re with good do you guys know what to remember we re working on fractions and multiplying them
at the children s zoo an 8th of the animals are primates you were with so we took part of them and moved them to another cage let s say monkeys we re going to say 18th and then how do we find a part of a part
away we broke them off into another group we re going to multiply whole you ve taken a part of a part so actually of the 8th we don t know what the whole was so you just have to say what part it is whole you said there was 24 and then 15 of them were primates then you would subtract to find the difference of how many were monkeys okay
part that s the difference so we re going to say 8 times 4 is 32 exactly we were breaking it into even groups monkeys you re going to show that and write about it through the whole thing you might want to put your question write it you know how we always kind of write that at the top so you can show it write about it and solve it
good have you solved yours okay now remember a lot of times when we do fractions like this it tends to sound like a subtraction problem something taking away from something else but that s like if we said there were 24 students in the class and half of them were girls we would say 12 were girls and 12 were boys but we don t have a starting number do we
we just have we re saying part of a whole so really a part of a part is multiplication and you just multiply across exactly right so 3 eighths of them play musical instruments you might want to write the question at the top so you can present it to the class and you re going to divide it into 4 pieces you re going to show it so you would this is when we d be making our arrays
rows okay then you re going to how did you do it and why did you do those things okay the total number of pieces should be how many 8 exactly and that s really like a common denominator because you can put 8 into groups of 2 and 8 into groups of 4 okay
okay you can put 20 into groups of 2 and you can put 10 into groups of 2
20 so you need to write your write the problem at the top okay and then you re going to divide your paper show what this model looks like remember what we showed you then solve it the answer was 7 twentieths then why did you do that okay make sure people can read it
so the 2 of you guys when you did it was 4 fifths we figured it out but we don t know what you need to realize you re on the right track you said 5 and 4 but your bottom number was 15 15 is really a common denominator you can put 15 into groups of 5 and you can put 15 into groups of 3
right one 2 3 4 but actually this is your bottom number so you have to have columns and then this one can be rows then not 3 rows you always use the bottom number wouldn t you use 15 though well when you multiply across 4 times 2 is 8 so 8 fifteenths is your answer
yeah and the overlap part is going to be you ll have 15 all together here because you did 5 columns and 3 rows 15 times 3 is i mean 5 times 3 is 15 and then your overlapping part is going to be 8 but you re going to shade it different colors remember to do the different colors that we ve been doing 15 rows well pieces you said 5 and 3
rows you ve got 5 rows 3 columns when you multiply that together that s going to give you 15 pieces all together i get it so you re writing your problem down did you solve your problem on a separate sheet of paper so when you re getting ready to model yours just listen for a minute okay
part the reason this is unique is a lot of times these questions sound like a subtraction question leftover so how are you to know on a test if they have all of these mixed up we have subtracted fractions right but usually when we subtract fractions they usually start with 24 rows and half of them are 24 kids in a class and half of them are girls
it would be 24 minus like 12 because that s half we we re just saying it s a part of a part so you re going to say one half and we know of means multiplying and then it says one half if i had a half and i took a half again you re going to wind up with a 4th
that if i took a piece of paper then cut it in half then took another half of that it s going to be divided into remember when we did the paper folding so this is really a common denominator okay so that means i can put 4 into groups of 2 and i can put it into groups of 2 here
now when you get ready to model and show it your little diagram your common denominator is how many you have in the whole group so you re going to have 2 rows and 2 columns
4 so your overlapping part should only be the 14th you re going to do this color and then you re going to do this one color and this overlapping part is the answer absolutely we have 14th so you should have 6 pieces 8 pieces
okay so you understand you want to put the answer right there it one half times 18th is or 14th is great
there okay all right 18th good okay now what this is saying i love that day you can go get a bingo because you used all of the things we ve been working on
so we re saying one half is this yours yes a lot of times these kinds of questions i ll wait until comes back because i want to help both of you all at the same time when we re making these arrays and we multiplied this all right
what i was telling all the groups is a lot of times these kind of questions sound like subtract questions a part of a part multiplication how are we supposed to know whether or not it s a subtraction question because have we subtracted fractions yes so how do you know if it s a multiplication question or a subtraction question
you usually when it s a subtraction of fractions we might start with like a whole number we might say there s 24 kids in a class and we re going to take a half of them so we started with a whole number did we have a whole number in this particular question
of so we have one half times 3 fifths so when we multiply straight across 3 tenths this number is the total number in our group into but it s actually a common denominator because we can put 10 into groups of 2 and 10 into groups of 5 so when we model it how many pieces is it going to have in it
5 your bottom number 10 when you shade it you might want to do columns and rows so you re going to have 2 columns and 3 rows not 3 rows
bottom 5 rows and you ll shade in one of those and for you guys you re going to have 32 pieces in yours when you show it and then you re going to shade in you ll have 8 columns and 4 rows it use math terms like denominators you should be able to move on
here why are you putting it on the whiteboard go ahead and solve it there because we need to show it good good it s okay
good your answer are you going to put your answer right there okay have you are you going to write about it and prove it everything you can communicate mathematically using math terms denominator have you drawn your picture too your graph
yeah show it on the chart paper so people can see it you re not going to have that much time done we ve got about 10 minutes so go ahead and finish it up
why did you do the you know that do the best you can yeah good what are you guys okay are you working together we worked together it feels like you should be working on this chart paper together
it solving it i mean you haven t solved it yet it did you write we don t have any room yeah you do you have plenty of room it doesn t have to be just write how do you know that your answer is right
visuals what you can also do is say you folded a piece of paper in half and folded it in half again you open that piece of paper back up the shaded piece would be this is really like paper folding okay part so if we take 18th times 14th this is 18th well you multiply straight across
part why did you think it was 2 eighths okay for when we ve subtracted fractions and we have added them this almost sounds like a subtraction question right
but the difference is when we would have a question about subtracting we might say i have 24 students and half of them are girls half of 24 is 12 so 24 -12 on but we re not starting with a whole number here we re saying i have a part a fraction and i m going to take another part and you look right here
48 which is it 32 so you want to make sure you know your math facts because you have to be able to multiply straight across because if you don t multiply the answer will be wrong if you re hesitant a little bit we worked on those earlier in the year so you might want to go back and your agenda has all the math facts okay all right so this number right here you should be looking right here
okay this number right here is really like a common denominator okay i can put 32 into groups of 8 and i can put 32 into groups of 4 okay your grouping for this answer is going to be how many little pieces are you going to have
you have your work from yesterday remember when we practiced making the arrays showing this modeling it you remember being organized is important you might want to start writing the question because we re going to present these to the class
now it s right there denominator that means i can put these into groupings of it for example if i this is my whole group
if i took a half of this now i have 2 pieces but then if i just had that half and i cut it in half again i now have how much of the total grouping
denominator they are equal sized pieces you ve got to listen to what i m saying paper i divided it in half and i took that half and divided it in half again right pieces the bottom number says the number of pieces
now it s fourths i divided the whole grouping into fourths so they are equal pieces so what was here s my half and my other half is one of how many pieces 4 this was one of 4 i found a common denominator of equal sized pieces
practice this is your common denominator 8 and 24 part awesome you got yours super
okay you ve got to show why did you write it twice okay get another sheet of paper all right come on back to your seats
i ll be working with you more during study hall and stuff because you re new here so you ve probably you ve got some gaps but i ll get you caught up okay just try to understand what we have now and it will all come together for you okay that s the hardest part about that come back to your seats
one have a seat okay all right do i have a okay
5 some groups i ll wait some groups aren t finished and that s okay we ll work on them tomorrow but i do have some groups that are finished
so if your group is finished and you d like to present you and we didn t finish are you sure today we only have time for about one presentation anyways
up we ve got to move to reading give him your attention give him your attention so you can understand
perfect do you want to put it on the board and then scoot back so people can see it over wait a minute your question what was the question though where s your original sheet of paper
it was in my desk but then it fell off i think do you think you can remember what it was about i think it was about glasses okay
don t there were 3 fourths with glasses have glasses 14th of people had sunglasses okay it said to draw a model so 3 fourths of people had glasses and of those meaning multiply 14th of them had sunglasses versus reading glasses okay
okay so when you modeled it how did you come up how many pieces are in your model
total pieces one 2 3 4 on horizontal and 4 on the other side then we shaded 3 fourths okay and so you made one 2 3 4 rows
that was 4 and you shaded 3 of them that showed this particular fraction one 2 3 and then you did 4 columns one 2 3 4 and then you shaded one of those then your overlapping was 3 sixteenths 16 is your common denominator 16 i can put 16 into groups of 4
pieces your answer was 3 sixteenths how did you okay 1st we drew a model then we colored the model to show 14th and 3 fourths then we multiplied 14th and 3 fourths to get 3 sixteenths and we couldn t simplify 3 sixteenths so our answer is 3 sixteenths okay
okay so the reason you re going from sixteenths to fourths anybody know why you do sixteenths to fourths why would you just not do fourths you have to find a common denominator same you can t do apples and oranges quantities so you have to divide it out equally and then proportion it
good fantastic if you are not finished go ahead and put your work on the back table
you well 1st of all before we do that let s take a look for our objective and if you want to take a look over there on the board it says as follows by the end of the week i ll be able to . you have 4 of em now we not going to get to all of them today but at least by the end of the week or by the time we get closer to it most of our objectives will be done the 1st one says analyze and review a blueprint which i m going to hand to you
identify the dimensions that are used in the blueprint determine how the blueprint is how the blueprint is used in the real world and design our interior for our smart house or smart school whichever one you choose all right so now what i m about to hand you is a blueprint
notice that there are 3 sheets attached you can keep this you are responsible for the one that you have
part on the front page now before you all get started take about 30 seconds to kind of look at all 3 pages the 3rd page all 3 of them yeah all 3 pages okay
now on the last page i want you all to focus your attention on the last page all right now if you look at now you see you may not be able to see those numbers but those hava a 8 and a slash with an x by 11
that tells you now when you re designing a house those of you who all want to be architects and this is what architects do case say for example comes to me and says teacher n i want you to build my dream house you
you you build so you came into the teacher n designing architect firm and you said to us teacher n i want you to build my dream house and i m going to ask you how big do you want it house do you want it to be the biggest thing in washington d c those are the kind of questions they ask you
so now if you look that this will be the inside of somebody s house on the last page this will be so you have everything from the garage porch that s like a sitting area area a nook is like a sitting area
okay and you have a kitchen study now a study is pretty much in some of these houses some that i ve been to but if you get a chance and when you get all of this money make sure you give me a shout out and some houses actually when you walk into them they have like a little study books so some houses in some cases your house your dream house could have whatever it is that you want
so you have the kitchen it looks like this one has what bedrooms and a maybe a bathroom
now one thing i want to point you to is where you have these dimensions all right where it has 8 all right now this little mark here this little mark which says 8 with a little slash
feet so it s actually 8 feet by 14 feet so that s actually how the bedroom size the master bedroom size is
so usually the master bedroom s usually one of the biggest rooms in the house all right so pretty much this is what the interior of your blueprint would look like all right who s with me so far me do we have to like when we build our dream house or when you design it
okay do we have to make all of the rooms like if we have the time actually it all depends on yours because your blueprint is going to look different from
so so like if i wanted to build a house do i have to do the inside or just like the outside what now to now if you go to the teacher n and architect firm we going to start you even before we get to the inside i mean somebody may say okay is this what you want
porch do you want a circular driveway all that stuff is taken care of on the outside some people may start on the inside okay what do you want on the inside how many bedrooms how many bathrooms 23 bedrooms kitchen 0 course i would hope so
all right now most people again most people may say okay i m going to start on the outside we ll start on the inside all right so let me hear briefly so let s jump back before i get to your hands all right so right now we ve already accomplished one of our objectives which says we ve identified the dimensions that are used in the blueprint
so if you take a look real quick how all right so how do architects measure what feet they measure in feet feet now here s the other thing that you all probably don t know that all architects use pencil when they re designing so this is so yes
so if you go any architect firm if you know any architects i got your questions hold on i got your questions any time you see an architect or you re going to an architect firm you may see they have now they may use pen to highlight but to start their drawing out they always use pencil because it s kind of the same way as math
dimension all right and we also determine that the blueprint is used by architects and they do this all day long in some cases it may take them i don t know in some cases to a day up to months months just to actually come up with something like this
but again and up and again it all depends on now you may want in your dream house or your smart house you may want a play room versus now in s room he might want a man cave in his place
different so that s one of the reasons why i did not choose for you all to do the group one because i think that everyone has their own ideas of what theirs look like so this also can be also a blueprint for you when you get older what this is what i want my dream house to look like okay so this is what you re going to do
use all right of course now what are some of the materials that they use show your hands please what are some things that they use me tape measure things tape measure okay what else
a pencil got to use a pencil yes ma am things for the walls bricks okay now you re thinking of the construction architect that keep the walls together 0 drywall okay now that s when after you get your whole thing done and you say yes this is what i want then all that that s step 2 of the process
step one is actually this piece of paper here ahead now said about the construction one what s that little ruler thing that has the i know exactly what you re talking about a weight measure i think it s called an equalizer i m not 100% sure
now and sometimes they do use those even with architects all right so now all right hands down all right so now on this sometimes now this is what the kind of paper now use regular graph paper that you all have been able to when we graphed our points back when we did the cartesian plane
this is very similar this is what they used something similar to this so what you re going to do at this so we re at the beginning stages of our design so now you want to think about all right 1st of all are you going to do a smart house
design so your design is different from somebody else s some of you all may have similar designs but everybody s is going to be different so before so i m going to hand you the graph paper teacher n i don t think what was your question my dear do i have to it s up to you
now keep in mind this is your design suggestion or you can do on the outside question now this mainly is for the inside of it now you ve got to kind of sketch on the kind of say i want a picket fence around
i want a long driveway little stuff like that i ll give you that in just a 2nd your mouth your mouth what is this that is a utility closet teacher n it s your house you can add or take away anything that you want
what can a person really have a house like that that s just the interior i know but can they yeah now once this now this in turn all this and you should be in your correct seat all right all of this here will eventually translate into what you put in here
eventually so you might now say all right but this looks kind of small but once you go into the house it s kind of like 0
before you start doing that now the one thing the architect s never go without ruler i knew it because your dimensions or your measurements may be incorrect if you do what they call free hand which means you re doing it without looking now what is this for
now the paper i m handing you is what you want the front of your house to look like now keep in mind everybody s house everybody s dream house smart house is going to be different
so the end product is the end product will be it s going to be your smart house
house so all of them together some houses getting too big well for one everyone s going to have different views and everyone s going to be disagreeable i want a mansion so i don t care all right question
yes because i want to draw 4 sides all right so within the next 15 minutes i ll wait for somebody to talk cause i ll wait
so within the next 15 minutes i want to kind of see what your design is within the 15 minutes all right now again you can start on the inside or you can start on the outside have that s up to you
you go as teacher f if i can borrow rulers please all right all right 15 minutes all right now in these 15 minutes at least get your designs together
i don t understand you what don t you understand hmmm i don t understand okay all right now again talking remember it s yours now once architects get into them then they can make their fine they can make their changes too
but keep in mind this is a 1st draft so this is the 1st draft so again so again this is only the 1st draft and again architects don t and in many cases unless you know your stuff usually architects go through paper
what s this going to be for house all right now in some cases in most cases you re talking in some cases most people most architects i should say go through paper
change so usually the 1st one is usually never the one they go with usually now sometimes whoever s drawing it may say yes i want that or they may come back to say you know what something can you add or can you add a movie projector room or can you add an indoor pool stuff changes
so now keep in mind your mouth so keep in mind so keep in mind this is like i said the 1st one is usually not the final one what i want to add to my house or my smart school
now now that s going to be your inside that s going to be the inside of my house right outside now use your dimensions so like say for here
all right so in your i m going to ask you this what are you going to build are you going to do a smart house or a smart school smart house all right so on your design where do you want i don t know where do you want the bedroom to go
go all right so you got to make it it all right so if it s going to go so if you re going on the inside you put a little corner there say and there you got the master bedroom i want this to be the master bedroom all right so on this side you re going to put your master bedroom draw it
yeah so use your ruler and put a little corner there say master bedroom feet 10 feet 8 feet because now now keep in mind 14 feet is yeah so the 14 feet is all right you left them in here
all right so
house right here she has where boom in off to i guess my left i guess my left your right is where her dining spot is study so you can do it that way okay
all right what is the blank sheet for the blank sheet is for the outside the exterior like i said you have to make the dimensions now let me jump back to where it says 8 feet by 14
usually the 14 is the long way which is over by your lockers and the 8 feet is like the front of the classroom so keep that in mind also so so the short end is the front of the classroom and the long end is back like up against the bulletin boards up against the lockers
0 all right turn around all the way around don t forget your dimensions your dimensions are what
again what are your dimensions in what feet your dimensions are in feet all right and don t forget all right and don t forget to put your so you re going to put 8 dot if you re going to do 8 feet 8 dot decimal 0 i guess an apostrophe or a little line right after your last number
0 exactly exactly and like i say hey it s on video me now that s is that the interior or the exterior is that the interior or the exterior inside or outside
it s the inside okay now my question to you would be don t forget to put your dimensions on this too case now since you re doing i kind of see where you re going with yours all right now keep in mind in case of doing the room portion make sure you have that in feet
now you can start with the lockers make sure you have that in inches like 12 inches 13 inches is that good enough so far okay now you can have you got to tell me now so what would this part of your my porch your porch make sure you put porch with your dimensions
how s that just keep that in mind when you re drawing it okay teacher n can i like put steps on sure yeah
steps there are steps look at your blueprint look at your blueprint i don t see no steps you don t see no steps it s yours it s yours okay look look on the family room too because that way can i put the word steps you can
can now what you also could do somebody s talking what else you could do is now most architect s as what you this is what you re doing now you re talking you re talking what most architect s does or do is most of them kind of do a 1st floor blueprint
floor or do you want everything on one level you now do you want your smart house to have everything on one level or do you want it to have like an upstairs downstairs and a basement i want a basement which means you re going to need a whole separate you ll need another one of those
so right now this would be i m going to assume this would be the main level of your house all right what is that one
there i got the room i got the entrance i got the lockers i got the hallways i got the classrooms now keep in mind the hallways is a separate blue print so right now if i m looking at this correctly you re doing just the classroom is that what you re now are all the classrooms going to be the same
or are all of them going to be different so now that s one blueprint for one classroom you re going to need another one for another classroom so now you re going to do one for the hallway
this is the main so this is your main so that s your main okay now so on that one so for your blue print guys for those of you all who are doing more than one
make sure you title it classroom make sure it says that way so when you present this to other people who have walked into your firm they say okay all right from the barnes architect firm okay i walked into your you say here teacher n
i say okay i got your classroom this is how your classroom blue print s going to look so another 11 this is how the foreyay is going to look or the main part of when you walk in you see what i m saying is the main entry like downstairs or like now yeah
now in some cases in some houses that i ve been in some people are doing a school now so now keep in mind don t forget to put your dimensions on your blue print 0 okay so you have to indicate it so in other words where do you want your door to go
all right so put entry door exit door front door draw it see so you can now keep in mind so you want a big entrance right so if you want a big entrance that s what you put
big entrance or entryway entrance exit unless you re going to tele port tele port can you tell like this part is the doors yeah spelling double check it
it what are what is this one room 0 that s your outside right okay now my question to you okay now
this should be on your now this can be a draft i ll take that it should be on this because right now you that s from the inside so it could also be for outside too
now 0 an indoor pool all right so now can i put it on this you can put it on there but this is going to be a draft so what are your dimensions how many i ll give you another sheet so how big how wide do you want it
13 3 so you have to indicate that on there so when you put it on that then your dimensions have to go on there too you see what i m saying okay there you go but actually now keep in mind you re not doing it in inches feet how many feet across okay
this is going to be my for my tennis court and i just in case of a fire 0 okay i see what you re saying okay exit yeah put that on there like put it back here or
you can have i want to tell you something like if there s a fire jump out that window and go down the slide 10 inches no
now 10 feet 10 feet by how many so wait a minute this is i m going to guesstimate this is maybe i don t know maybe 6 feet so you got i m going to say this is about no
10 so you want it in feet because 10 inches is from maybe matter of fact come measure it it a yard stick do you think those are blinds i don t know exactly what that is no no
on pool party which is bigger feet yards yards i don t need no help y all yards or feet yards no
measure i want to show you the difference measure from the beginning of that locker to where 10 inches runs out from on the floor on the floor all right excuse you
floor put the ruler on the floor all right now stretch it stretch it from so 10 inches gets you right about there so that s a small pool so now keep in mind you want to i m going to have a mansion but now keep in mind
you don t want to think in feet and centimeters you want to think in feet point i want to have a 20 feet pool this going this way goes it s going that way okay so you re going this way be is it going to be 13 feet all right well then that s something else
that s another detail you have to work out with your architect all right so hold up yes can it just be a dream house it could be a dream house it could be a house too you re not focused i can tell a 10 feet pool now keep in mind keep in mind if you want it to fit a whole pool here you got to make sure it can fit
which means if your dimensions are off even if it s the smallest centimeter it s going to it s going to mess up your whole thing no i m going to have i don t want no big pool i want a square hot tub
pool you still have to think of how wide do you want it
it sounds great but i need to see it on paper as your draft like i say architects never get it right the 1st time they mess up me what you need talk to me
this is my classroom and this is the side where the and it s going to be okay now so this is your door and your windows are going to go where huh how many windows are you going to have i m going to have like 3 windows because there s going to be only one main window for the fire exit so where s your main window
so if you re going to have this is the main window okay all right now this part should be with your that s kind of like an outside sketch so this part the will be at the bottom so that s going to be your outside all right so this part will be your inside
so you have to put now put how big you want your windows okay excuse me on excuse you let me see what you have let me see what you have all right is that your outside or your inside outside all right hold on
all right excuse you have a seat have a seat have a seat i tried to make wood and brick but i can t so it i want this to be bricks but i don t know how to draw bricks draw like this draw a line down like this it doesn t have to be perfect
okay and you want now what do you want coming down the side of your brick wood all right now architect will tell you that s a great idea but here s the problem you re going to run into if water goes down it s going to it s going to cause actually you know to have a good a house got to have a good foundation
so if more water keeps going under there it s going to mess up your foundation which means your house it s going to soak up and make all your house to move and that s a lot of money to fix now if you re going to do water you could do like a fountain but i want on the water part i want like blue river things right there you can do that all right so let s just say that s the front door
okay now instead of you having water coming down that way you can have like a fountain here and then you can have like a little stream going to like wherever okay i know how i want to do it i need another piece of paper though are you running out yeah i m running out
so you may have to use this but don t worry we ll finish this up tomorrow don t worry day it s kind of like i don t like this idea and you start stop you throw it in the trash okay
question where are your dimensions what are your dimensions are they going to be equal inside pool are they going to have the same okay i m sorry make it red
both sit down if you were sitting down doing what you were supposed to do we wouldn t have all these excess conversations problem so we want equal distance from so my question is okay so where is this is it on the inside or the outside is it the inside
outside back yard back yard okay all right so the middle of all right let s just say this is the middle okay this is the middle all right break it down for me me this is the middle right the door going to be right there okay okay all right the pool on this side okay
now my question how big is your house what are the dimensions for your pool remember because you just said you want it to be so you want 10 feet wide mind it s going to be now keep in mind you said you want it to be you just said you want to make it equal on both sides
so if this side has to be 10 feet then the other side has to be 10 if you re thinking along those lines but if you want a bigger pool which means you re going to have to sacrifice some space on the hot tub you see what i m saying i want a bigger hot tub 0 you want a bigger hot tub which means you re sacrificing so okay
tub yeah okay so which means you re so you want to have the majority of your space your dimensions to be all the dimensions are going toward that hot tub okay and then from this side you want this to be the pool just strictly on the pool
huh all right now going back to now what do you think your dimensions should be
long okay so make sure you put that on there so from the door from the door to your hot tub was add it up
this like that it okay okay and that s going to be 17
it huh all right now i wish well finish working it out finish working it out all right as i m looking around as i m listening i hear a lot of people having side bar conversations but i don t see a whole lot on papers okay so if i wanted to do a kitchen how can i draw a kitchen that s that s where do you want your kitchen to go
i want my kitchen to go like in the back of the school so that s a separate room well like i said hey this is what architects do and they get paid big bucks to do this ball up paper all right so you re actually getting a taste of what architects do
build they draw stuff yeah do you want to see what i have this is my garage it s going to be like this is the outside all right i get the outside huh huh go go it s going to be like one side for me and the other side for my boyfriend i think and then this is the dining room go ahead no
no go ahead go ahead go ahead this is the dining room dining room this is the entry and that s the attic and that s going to be the room for my kids room now this is the outside of your house right design one room right now because i don t have a lot of paper to give
so whichever room you re going to do your dimensions on start there i don t know which one you re going to do so i m going to leave that up to you yep
yep so you say you want your kitchen to be in the hallway no
like it s not going to be in the hallway it s going to be like a cafeteria but the cafeteria is going to have a kitchen for the let me see how you re going to design that i m want to see that you re telling me and i see it do the cafeteria is right here right and that s where the door is at
right and it s going to be like a kitchen 0 okay i see what you re saying okay so that s a whole separate that s another that s another one do so that means you got to have see the more stuff you add the more blue prints you need good which means you think you re thinking outside of the box
so when your smart school goes into existence i want to make sure i become the principal of it all right where are your dimensions i don t see nothing i don t know what the dimensions are i just said it it because you were running your mouth all right explain what the dimensions are to her please
by feet by feet inches centimeters can you figure that out still start but right now that s all you have this is what architects do
0 this is sweet now this is is this the main level this is your main level yeah i only want one level okay so you want i only want one level okay i got a question for you where are you going to sleep okay you re master s okay
okay why do you want your game room and your bathroom right there because i ll have to use the bathroom when i play the games all right check your spelling okay now keep in mind great but you re dimensions like 10 feet and all that this is good man this is good this is good all right about 5 more minutes
teacher n can i go downstairs to see how the entry is no shut up excuse you all right what s up
what you got i m going to put a camera control room in there i don t even have no space to put a bathroom there okay no got to have so 18 by 4
16 remember i told you this is usually the length is how long it is all right and this is how short it is so when i put 18 so this is this would be that could be the 18 yeah and this would be 18
18 all right all right cafeteria just put because i don t know what to do if it s now now that could be now let me see what you re working with
have the of a garage so the garage goes into the kitchen the front room goes into the kitchen and the hallway is right here by the living room so everything s on one level yes because it s going to be like a mansion and then the basement is like the extra floor so everything s on one level right huh okay would this be like the family area
like where 0 yeah the livingroom which means that you re going to have to make i mean that could be open space whicih a lot of architects do space all right so everything s on one level okay
it like i say that s why we always does it in pencil all right for my kitchen it s going to have a cafeteria on this side and the kitchen s going to be in the back 0 yeah and this is make sure you indicate that on your drawing and this is where this is going to be like a kid s room by the hallway 2 kid s rooms okay
i gotcha the door s right there okay okay what else are you going to put you can t just have an entry way i don t know what s it s your school it is what you want to make it to be
can this be like a nature scenery right there it s your house want what you got
well one time i saw the house on a tv show what s it called where they have what s it called a waterfall okay now my question to you would be where do you want where do you want are you going to put that on i want all glass windows that s on the outside of your house okay
put that on there i don t know how square on a walk in locker
okay compared to this how would it be different from how would it be would be on the main lobby for teachers all right let s start wrapping it up
up can some lockers be on the it s up to you no it s yours but i have so many ideas
okay so it s going to be like a car that s open and when you slide down like one for the passenger seat and one of the driver and one for the kid s seat all right all right let s wrap it up
do not worry about that okay so asked since we started our new math unit called in large numbers we have been working with numbers up through 1000
far we have been working a lot with numbers in the 100s we have been adding numbers in the 100s we have been subtracting numbers in 100s and we have been using what we know about place value to help us do that
m if you are starting numbers if you start with 353 or 352 and you add the 7 and you make it 360 then you do let me take what he said so said you start with you said 357
353 so you start with 353 and you add 7 360 and getting to 360 even helps you to add numbers that are multiples of 10 being able to add numbers that are multiples of 10 and multiples of 100 it makes the addition and subtraction a little easier for us right
numbers a landmark number is a number that makes working with math easier right it makes adding numbers easier subtracting numbers easier numbers that is similar
yeah the hernandez family is traveling around the united states and will travel a total of 1000 miles so far they have ridden 247 miles how many more miles will they have to travel to reach their goal of 1000 miles so what is the problem
know that they traveled 247 and they are trying to get to 1000 so they traveled so far 247 miles right car they are traveling by car by vehicle and they have gone 247 miles so far
e they want to know how many more miles do they need to get to 1000 so 1000 miles would be their total right how are you going to deal with this problem this the question we need to answer is how many more miles do they have to travel to reach 1000 miles
so they already traveled a certain amount and they have a distance more to go right recently you put a 0 on the left hand side then somewhere along here you put a 247 and then you put 1000 at the end and i saw a lot of people do this with a question mark here
far this is sort of a missing value a missing number about there is a bunch of ways to solve it do 1st the remaining miles so are you thinking it is a number line
give me a thumbs up if you are tempted to want to use the number line who feels solid that using a number line as a visual representation that say it again what you are going to do
i am going to add 3 miles to this yeah so you want to jump forward 3 miles true so you want to jump forward 3 miles hand okay
you are going to add 50 miles to the 250 add 50 miles to the 250 300 so let me stop there for a minute
i noticed on my number line as i make these jumps as i make these jumps i am thinking about the size of these little they are kind of important and it reminds me a little bit about when we draw arrays when we draw arrays the size of the arrays matter matter why does this look smaller than this jump if i add a to my line
because 3 is less it is smaller right if i think of the quantity of these numbers 3 is a lot less than 50 so my little jump of 3 is smaller than my larger jump of 50 okay so when you make your number lines today which we are going to be making think about the size of those jumps that you make because they do matter they do make sense that small numbers have a smaller jump and bigger numbers have a bigger jump
it also helps you figure out where you are in this line okay 300 do you mind if i ask somebody else to finish it up next do 700
here so my jump from 300 to 1000 was my largest jump so i need a big mound to get there i also put arrows on each jump forward because i am traveling forward depending on how you are traveling your arrows might go a different direction backwards can anybody think of why you might go backwards if your arrow is this direction
minus it right let us finish up this one then talk about the other way we can draw a number line answer draw a number line and put hold on
done i have not gotten the answer yet so i do not need the visual representation of how i can solve it but how to actually answer it so i circle the 3 the 50 and the 700 d that helps us add them we have to add them
j to get the answer we have to add them to get the answer but why is it that those numbers that are circled are going to give us the answer represent the jumps that you made the jumps that we made right i did add to get the solution and i added in small pieces
700 if i were to add all these together what would be my answer 753 remember we talked about the and 753 so how can i answer this in a full sentence
sentence the hernandez family needs to travel 753 miles to reach their goal of good okay now you can talk to us about the other way to solve this
i would draw the number line and i would still put 1000 here and i would still be beginning with 247 yes is that what you put 0
line not sure so instead of drawing it like this was thinking about doing 1000 -247 but i am very interested in using number lines today as a visual representation to show how we are solving these problems
it do you want to give it a shot do you want to try it on here or do you want to talk to me about and i will do it for you it so i am going to take 1000 and subtract 247 miles i am going to show it on the board we want to subtract so we are going to go this direction
backward it was 200 800 what is your next move 40 you are going to subtract 40 smaller jump than what i just took
753 so where in all this business is our answer up here we circled what we jumped by and added it together thing would we circle 247 and call our answer 247
no we already know that one number we know we started with 247 because that is where the family landed after they stopped e the last one the last number that we landed on interesting so this 753 is our answer
when we solve it this way our answer is in a different spot answer it is not what we circle up here that is what we subtracted okay problem both ways you get the same answer which is 753 miles okay
us we are going to do a little bit more work with this using digit cards or numeral cards they are called
we have our math books out correct yes okay directions i am going to read them to you as we discuss what i am talking about here game we are going to be using these digit cards
they are individual cards with one number one digit on each card you are going to be working with specific cards that are already chosen for you so with your partner you are going to do the following you are going to chose or draw 3 digit cards to make a 3 digit number
3 shuffle them up 1st just to make sure they are all nice and spread out so i am going to have build a 3 digit number so put 8 in the 100s place
place she put 6 in the 10s place it that is to show that it is a 6 if the line is on the other end it is a 9 okay 4 so we did the 1st step so now you and your partner are looking at the 3 digit numbers for this game do not spend a lot of time making it
me now you are going to draw the number line and find your number between one and 1000 by adding line that means your arrows go this direction because you are adding okay i want you to practice the strategy of adding by jumping on the visual representation of your number line
next you are going to draw another number line and find your number in 1000 by subtracting jumping backwards so your arrow will go this way which means you are subtracting you can do it like did or or you can do it the way i am going to show you
so far you have chosen 3 cards and made a 3 digit number you have drawn 2 number lines one is for adding and one in case you are subtracting this is what you are going to do when it is over with your paperwork like this number you will have your 1st number line and your 2nd number line
264 for that i add a group of 6 then another group of 30 then a group of 700 jumping along like we just practiced on the board and my answer was 736 when i subtract it i did not do it like did it want i started with 1000 then i jumped back to 264
make i circled them just like i did on the top okay that this on this number line look very similar but did it differently
differently he started with 1000 and he subtracted the number that he was adding the number how many miles he was going i am not sure i understand what you mean honey he started with 1000 then he subtracted 364
yes you are right so would have done 1000 then these numbers up here would have been 264 that he was subtracting then landed on the answer it you added it did i started with 1000 and subtracted 500 but i am subtracting to get to 264
he subtracted 264 right there so you can choose whatever you feel more comfortable with sense in your notebook you will find your paper will look just like this 1st number line 2nd number line solve it solve it answer answer
then you have the line and you are going to do this again and again and again you are going to do this 10 times if you have time as many as you can before our period is nearing the end you want to stop towards the end and have a little debrief and talk about how it went for you and what strategies you used and what you found difficult okay so you have about 20 minutes or so to work on this
them so go with your 1st number once you get your 1st number and you do your 2 number lines and you are finished your notebooks you can choose another 3 numbers to make a 3 digit number okay yourself so if you get numbers that are high up like that maybe they will not always go in the 100s place right
that that if we are going to do addition and we get 999 9s for and example let us say you get a 9 and a 10 you will not get 10
5 do not make it 951 because then i am not saying you can not do that once or twice that is okay but try not to do that every single time because you will not be challenging yourself
22 for each 3 digits that you get 2 number lines subtraction another 3 digits one number line 2 number line subtraction any questions your partner is already selected anyone have any questions about what to do how to write it where to write it
date you can put the title right here numbers in the 100s and this will be here for you if you forget what to do and also i am here for you
okay how many people are wearing gray out of these 4 people one so what fraction of this group is wearing gray what fraction of this group is wearing gray j 14th 14th one out of 4
okay so this is much different than what we did with the rectangles cause we were just kind of cutting rectangles into 4 equal pieces and shading in one whereas this is looking at a group of things these we call these things up here
seat so we can look at lots of different things and break them into fractional groups group so i have one problem on the board for us to do together i have another one to do together and then you actually have 2 pages in your math book that you re going to work on independently and we re going to do a lot of this today just to get really good practice
yesterday member when you cut out do you remember when you cut out the 4 by 6 rectangles yes you cut out 4 of them and you put them into your notebook and you wrote 123456 yeah so we re all going to take notes together and we ll put them up here too
okay so this is our 1st problem of the day we re going to connect what we ve been doing here and move into talking about groups of things okay i have 24 oranges 14th of the oranges are for mister
donovan how many oranges will he get now does the problem tell me how many oranges mister me what does it tell me that you have 24 oranges and you re going to give 14th to mister donovan okay so it does tell me how many i start with and it does tell me what fraction of 24 i m going to give to him
so right now every single 333 i don t know what you are doing but it needs to end 332 and 2 okay you each have a bowl how many tiles do you think there are in this bowl 24 so pretend that these are oranges if you have green tiles then those are really rotten oranges
but pretend for now that these little tiles are your oranges 24 can you show me in your small groups how much doctor get show me the 14th that mister it so we okay so we see like 14th to the bottom yep like 14th of 24
okay so you see that 4 right there yep 4 times 6 is 24 and so then 6 pieces so you already know that tiles that s actually what we re going to move towards michael got it
desk this one over here this one over here so what s the 1st thing you re going to do to show this we re going to make a square that has 24
okay then we re going to like try to make a shape and separate one of them so the 3rd or the 4th okay so you have 24 tiles and you re going to make it into a rectangle be they ll be 6 by 46 by 4 okay so you re going to make a 6 by 4
and then what are you going to do with the 6 by 4 we re going to can somebody other than karen tell me it split it up into how many pieces 14th how many equal pieces i know okay 24 there s 24 tiles in here so you re going to split it up back into 24 equal tiles
no you want to take a guess how much is mister get 14th 14th so how many groups do i need to make out of this 24 into so it is in one equal group 24 but he s supposed to get 14th of that
that 44 equal groups because we re breaking it into 4 good i didn t say groups of 4 now you re supposed to be working with them and right now what i see is not earning you a class work point but i was trying to keep so what i see is i see groups of 4 mister donovan is supposed to get one out of 4 groups
so he gets one groups no we made 6 you made 6 groups so this is one stop for a 2nd this is one what 14th you just told me you made 6 equal groups so how is this 14th 16th 16th because it s one out of 6 equal groups that you made
so how many equal groups do you need to make to work with this problem 3 more you have 24 tiles total okay so i was noticing they re in little squares okay so then how did you know how many to put in each group she came up with a plan okay
group so what does the denominator mean we keep saying this thing one out of 4 what 4 is the okay week 14th means what what does 14th mean like 4 squares in a shape no no no
using 14th means maybe someone in another group can help this group mean we keep using this same phrase over and over and over again raise your hand if you know what 14th means
d one out of 4 equal one out of 4 equal parts
parts one out of 4 equal parts so you have 24 oranges or 24 tiles and you need to break it into what what do you need to do with the 24 tiles see you forgot what you were going to say i like how is listening very carefully too instead of playing with her tiles
answer what do you need to break the 24 into halves halves so are we finding does mister 4th so how many equal groups do we need to break the oranges into
m one row you re not listening to my question if your label is row and i m asking you how many groups oranges mister donovan is supposed to get one what you just said one out of 4 equal groups
so how many equal groups do we need to make with the 24 oranges n groups of i didn t ask you what the groups are of groups 4 why 4 because
what part of the problem is telling you the problem the problem is telling you make 4 groups what part of the problem is telling you to make 4 groups what do you see in the problem that is telling you to make 4 groups the problem s there not there
what do you see in the problem that s telling you to make 4 groups 4th what part of the 14th and she doesn t know the word but everybody else in this room does remembered the denominator which is this bottom number is telling me me teacher make 4 groups 1st
so go ahead with your tiles and do what it s asking you to do something what kind of groups do i need to make everybody groups so make 4 equal groups right now with your group
okay so if you take one of these and we make a bunch of those that are equal are there 4 groups no there in the bottom we have to how many groups are there 71236 that you need to make 4 groups
guys you did this 1st for a reason you okay did you make 4 equal groups they made 8 okay them we re supposed to make 4 equal groups and i think it s like this
opinion so you really don t need a notebook right now honorable whole you still have one whole it looks like 24 groups of one right now
can you smush them together and make them into groups of 44 different groups did you make 4 different groups looks like one big group so let me help out those groups that are still struggling s group made a 4 by 6 and pulled them apart in shapes that look like this
s group made a 4 by 6 and pulled them apart in groups that look like this s group i m not sure exactly how you did it but you made stacks they have 4 stacks and they re all each the same height okay and s group they did this they made 4 rows that are all even and they pulled them apart on your group and s group
just take one from so don t put those back together i just said i liked how they were all separated into 4 equal parts that see on s desk and see on s desk hm so they did it you each have one representation of each of these
good exactly okay one these ones are a little bit more simple if you re trying to get it done quickly
so now that each group has made 4 equal groups how many of those 4 equal groups does mister
get according to the 14th 14th so you have 4 fourths on your desk get pull how much he gets aside and show me how much is mister
getting pull it onto one of the other people in your group s desk mister donovan today and is mister
today yeah he in one group and hm so just said something just said something very quietly to me but i want to tell you all what she said because it was a really good thing she said 0 you made 4 groups and what mister
donovan gets is the numerator she knew this word and she hadn t even been here for many days here so we learned it in 3rd grade
you learned it in 3rd grade good so and could you put is going to be mister today can you give 14th of that rectangle yep how many tiles did you just give her
it i didn t ask you to give her 4 tiles i asked you to give her 41 out of 4 groups minute the rest of you can we answer these questions okay me what fraction does mister
get can somebody answer this question get do you need to re read the problem in red
a 14th 14th and if you had your hand up did you have that same answer mister donovan gets 14th so i m going to shade in 14th so i break it into 1234 equal parts and i shade in how many
them okay so it s 14th of how many total pieces he gets 14th of how many total pieces 24 now since you each have those of you in the room who are right now mister donovan how many oranges does mister
me how many oranges does mister get okay guys where s the other tile okay so doesn t this look exactly like the 4 by 6s that are up on the board that we ve been working with
61234561234 so what i did was i broke it into 2 pieces and then i broke it into 4 pieces
mister donovan gets 6 oranges okay now let s read the next question what fraction do i keep now remember the 1st thing you did was you broke it into 4 equal parts
donovan s so how many of them are yours to keep how many are yours to keep c 13rd you have one out of 3 equal pieces yes let me ask you this
3 how many equal pieces did you break 24 into from the beginning pieces has one of them so how many do you have left on your desk 3 how many did you make from the beginning
c 333 out of 4 do you know how to say that fraction that means 3 out of 4
better does anybody know how to say 3 out of 4 another way j you have 3 out of 4 cause originally you made 41234 and you get to keep 3 of them
123 exactly or we keep now let me ask you this part read the last question with me
how many oranges do i keep 6 how many do i get to keep 18 and how did you get 18
because i know that there s 6 in each and i know that 6 times 3 equals 18
point so i know a lot of people were going to say the same thing but she said it today and a lot of times she holds it in
that she said 0 there s 3 groups left and there s 6 in each one and that equals 18 yes yes ahead so put all the 24 tiles back in the bowl
the dimensions in the the length and the width yeah okay
do we read i moved this one over so that you can use this as a reference what we did here and i left this information here but the names will change together charlie had 24 baseballs okay we re not talking oranges any more
like i said it could be fractional parts of lots of different things earlier we talked about oranges a minute ago and now we re talking about baseballs did he gave 2 thirds to anthony okay how many baseballs did anthony get
okay so this one s a little bit different because the numerator is no longer one now so what fraction does anthony get question what fraction does anthony get
and that s probably the easiest question i ll ask in the whole lesson anthony so anthony will get 2 thirds 2 thirds of what baseballs yeah 24 exactly 2 thirds of 24
is this baseballs now it s baseballs yeah so your tiles are no longer oranges out remember before you do any wait wait wait wait out before you do anything can anybody tell us how many groups we re going to break the baseballs into
24 how many equal groups do we need to make story how many equal groups do we need to make okay 2 thirds is a fraction so this doesn t 3 what 3 yes from from the denominator fantastic you guys are using these words already really well
so it s telling me in the denominator to make what where did i put that black marker 0 it s right here to make 3 equal groups now as a group you see what
okay so i suggest you put them in an array like we were using 4 by 6 rectangle can you make a 4 by 6 rectangle there s 6 by 4 okay in yes okay
now i asked you to stop drawing act okay so you need to participate or you re going to lose participation and class work points do you understand do you understand you okay how do you know that these groups are equal
example and what s confusing i thought it was 6 you through there was supposed to be 6 in each that cause in the other one you did it by 6 but part of the thing that is making you confused is cause you moved that 14th over to so you only had 3 left on your desk so it looked like 3 thirds
but it was really 3 out of 4 if you included what she took away good did we make 3 equal groups yes if you re in a group of 3 you can each take 13rd that s fine
doing you made 3 rows and you re going to just separate them like this fine okay you don t have to make a 4 by 6 if you don t want to that can you see a way you can always look back on the charts
there do we all have 3 equal groups you okay i think we re ready no i m not you have 3 columns yes
ready so we said anthony gets 2 thirds of this 24 and i m looking at this chart and i think the easiest way to find thirds is to make a 4 by 6 and break it like this way see that s what has on her desk s group did that same thing
so i m going to go over here and i m going to break it into 123 equal parts and now how many of them does anthony get parts how many is anthony supposed to receive say 9 not how many baseballs
get does he get 13rd look at the story thirds so one of the people in your group take 2 thirds and put it on your desk right now one person from your group should take 2 thirds and put it on their desk right now in 543 that s not helping your group
you need to put them back and one of you needs to have 2 out of those 3 equal parts on their desk right now tiles 2 out of those 3 equal parts
5432 and one this was confusing
hah okay so you made 31 momento momento you made 3 equal parts and anthony gets how many of those equal parts them so you should have 2 of those 3 equal parts on your desk
see now what s our next question ready how many baseballs does anthony get thirds you have 2 thirds you have 2 thirds and you have 2 thirds
that how many baseballs is that baseballs so only his desk right now has only 2 baseballs 44 how many baseballs is this
so how many does he have on his desk know 18 wow where did you come up with that fancy multiplication equation cause i knew that there were 8 and i know that 3 times 4 is okay
so what i hear saying is her groups look like this so she sees 4 times 2 equals 8 so she saw that there were 8 in each of the groups and there were how many groups groups so she sees i m going to try and do it like i did down here
so she sees 2 groups with 8 in each group 16 very good good now one last thing before i send you off on your own
you broke it into 3 equal groups and you gave how many of those groups to anthony anthony so how many groups does charlie get to keep for himself anthony how many equal groups are left over for him
6 i mean 88 groups or 8 baseballs 8 baseballs so i m asking how many groups are left for charlie 8 groups you just told me 8 baseballs charlie 8 how many groups does have on her desk one ah one group she has one group left
you so the 2 blue groups are the groups we gave away and the white group is the group that we did not give away group now inside that group it tells us how many baseballs he keeps me how many baseballs does charlie have left
how many baseballs does this show us whoops i forgot to write the fraction over here said it nicely 3 fourths i m sorry you what fraction the question says what fraction does he have left
there 33 groups and how many of them are shaded in 3rd so how many baseballs is that how many baseballs is in 13rd of 24 those of you who have the one group left on your desk your hands should be up
and other people too but if you have the one group on your desk you can at least count them g 88 baseballs 8 baseballs now how did you get that
because i know 4 times 2 equals 8 so she s got 2 columns of 4 and 4 times 2 equals 8 baseballs left this 8 +16 equals what 16 what does that equal 8 +16
24 interesting 24 equal 18 +6 24 interesting it is interesting it s interesting works so i broke this into 4 equal parts
j one +31 +34 works so right now you turned in page 5 for homework and on the back of page 5 is page 6 so page 6 has 2 more problems just like this and you can use your tiles and work in the same groups
yes you know can i come back and you can tell me in a minute let me pass these out 1st not now
later thank you you re welcome 00 okay
let s bring that up
working you got to get your work done so what is it asking you to do 1st what did you do 1st 8 groups you made 8 groups done 0 this is a good idea to draw a rectangle
you i m trying to do a like the other paper okay so a 4 by 8 just make a rectangle cut it in half so now i have 1234 okay how i have 2 do you see columns if i cut each of them in half now i have 8 no
44 columns so if i cut each of those in half now i have 8 exactly so now i have a 4 by 8 so i love how she wrote that 24 that s a great way to remind yourself cause remember that s what i did up there 24 and so what is you re not the only one in the group and that s why we put it on s desk
okay so that everyone can touch it and work with it no so let s make it a 4 by 6 before we do anything else okay now what have 4 rows 3 does this have 3 and it s supposed to have how many rows is it supposed to have
2 no rows so we only have 3 rows right now so we need to move some in to the law row 0 we have 4 rows go do you see what she s doing she s making 4 rows because before you only had 3
did she just counted 6 columns cause she knows it s going to be 456 okay so okay together ethan has 24 marbles are there 24 here good he gives 2 eighths of his collection to his sister ruby
do wait he gave 2 eighths of his collection to his sister right with that fraction what is the problem telling you to do
right how many groups do we need to break this up into into 2 eighths 2 eighths isn t a number of groups what part of that fraction tells you how many groups to break it into stop for a 2nd when we look at the fraction 2 eighths what part of the fraction tells you how many groups to break it up into
what the bottom number is called the denominator denominator okay so break it into 8 equal groups that after you break it into 8 equal groups how many of those groups are we going to give to ruby there don t waste a lot of time with a ruler time so we ve been working with what are the dimensions of those rectangles up there
13rd the dimensions of the rectangles 0 the sides yeah the sides so how many are on this left side side 44 and how many squares are there across the top
6 yeah so it s a 4 by 6 paper i have 2 you have a 3 by 3 by 8 which equals 24 but it might be easier to do a 4 by 6 already okay
okay that s fine okay okay so why did you break it into half
half cause i did a 8 by 3 okay you did a 3 by 8 because 3 times 8 well we ve been working with 4 by 6s so should we start to try and use a different dimensions rectangle hm yeah does that seem like a good idea to use something totally different than what we have been using this is only like our 3rd day of fractions so we probably want to stick with that same tool right now
guys yep can you help him we ll get done a lot faster if you both do it at the same time you wonder or you i wonder you wonder
sorry i thought you were doing something different so now you have 6 so do you want to put any more this way
faster they were really big pairs hah okay can you make a quick sketch of a 4 by 6 on your paper
your eraser you don t have an eraser better go out and get one this weekend hah okay so let s make a quick sketch of a 4 by 6 i m going to be done before you even get started
oops except i made a mistake okay 4 by 6
so in the problem how many groups is it telling you to break this up into 88 can you do that right now pencil i know right away that this is 2 equal groups right
so can you with your pencil make lines that show me 8 equal groups quickly 2341234567 okay we have too many okay because we don t want to waste a lot of time just drawing
okay okay in this problem how many groups is it telling you to make
so look at the problem by 8 nope the fraction is 2 eighths one of these numbers tells you how many groups to break this into one the bottom number tells you how many groups to make
groups so that s a group of 8 i didn t ask you to make a group of 8 i asked you to cut this 8 times so that pretend that it s a sandwich okay and you re going to share it with 7 other people there s 8 of you and you re all going to share it
amount how would you cut it up to make sure that everyone gets the same amount for 8 people so you just made 3 equal pieces okay so how can we break this up
okay so we didn t get through nearly as much as we wanted to get through today cause our goal as you can see from our objectives is to find fractional parts of a group so basically to be able to do what we did here this is a very very complicated part of math in 4th grade right and it s going to get very easy
do you re going to be able to look at the fraction and one of these numbers tells you how many groups to make which one is it here which one of these numbers tells you how many groups to make n the bottom the bottom number tells you how many groups to make so i have 24 i need to make 3 equal groups
did anybody notice a division connection there
c 24 divided by 3 equals 8 and i was hoping today you would notice that cause some of you are struggling trying to figure out i don t know how many to put in each group well if i have 24 baseballs and i m putting them into 3 groups 24 divided by 3 equals 8 and what does the top number tell me
numerator it s the numerator but what information is it giving me so the bottom number the denominator tells me how many groups to break it into and the top number the numerator tells you what in how many numbers to shade in or how many were given away or how many you are keeping
then in this situation back here it was how many mister keep we ll be doing this for the next few days next week okay my hope is that today you understand that the denominator tells you how many groups to make later make sure your name is on the worksheet and stick it in your math folder
i do not know thank you teacher i did it group nope you focus right on your
what no you are fine here you can now move back to your other desk yes so 3rd graders so and are already on fasst math
and you guys are going to do your aimsweb and then you will get on fasst math 4th graders you are going to do your aimsweb with me then we are going to do our math lesson when we are done with our math lesson you guys will then transition into fasst math
is parents as some of you noticed did bring some easter surprises for you now it is a baggie full of lots of different goodies from there is a card in there and it says happy easter if you celebrate it
hop so happy spring i think is what it means there we will talk about it at the end of the day easter easter is sunday for the people that celebrate it
tomorrow there is no school tomorrow but on tomorrow 0 you celebrate on friday sunday what we are going to do i am going to set the listening timer
m so i am setting the listening timer but in order to receive these tickets you need eyes on the speaker voices off off you are going to take aimsweb with us today i know normally you are down with miss p
day so it is a progress monitor so we do it quite frequently minutes put your name and date in but i do not want to start over well you might not have to
t can i borrow a pencil yeah put your scissors away i am going over there miss m is this for and when they come over his no just put your name and date right now
know raise your hand when you have your name and date morning i put it on my desk you put it on your desk and is it there yeah it was does everybody else have a pencil that is sharpened
lunch is this yours m name and date at the top again can i see a fresh raise of hands who has their name and date already at the top
t if you know how to spell them yes board where is your question i put it in my desk the board is you do not have this i am correcting it so you do not have to put that
i have 2 boards in my desk so please take out a board and we are going to erase it cause it is after lunch good i am not going to erase this because i do not want you to forget
are they all facing all the same way like is face everyone the cameras the camera there are 3 cameras so they are focused where you have your stuff ready looks ready and minutes you will get onto fasst math
you will go downstairs and get your number from miss p is class ready 4th graders you have 4 minutes keep working
yep you too yep go ahead just keep them on put them around your neck if you feel that they are bugging you like has them
can we skip you can skip around if you need to yes
math remember go to miss m is table you are going to go downstairs to miss p is class games and if it is not in there if you do not have it then you are going to just have to come up and work with miss m and no fasst math today
there and you tell the substitute teacher you are with who for the afternoon job go ahead that is fine you write on your paper
grade who i would like you to hand out math folders for me that pencil is down correct thank you thank you
4th graders i am going to have you come closer together for this lesson me you can sit at is desk get your pencil
s we are doing you are at your desk honey it is math time take out your so take out your math vocabulary math vocabulary like has
out he was doing what was near his body body listen what is your direction your direction is to take out what
out your glossary your multiplication sheet put that right on the do side of your folder not done cause you still have more to do job so we have been talking for a little while about what
math yep and your multiplication chart times i threw the old one away you threw out your multiplication chart i have a laminated one where is that ahead what have we been talking about in math what are some words that you remember or some areas we have been focusing on
r who can say a word maybe from your math dictionary that we wrote down what are some things we talked about when we were sitting at the u table on tuesday we did not start talking about fractions just yet
close i see that you are looking at that word and you think it sounds like area but it is what it looks like array arrays we were talking about arrays and they have to do with what type of math addition subtraction multiplication
math multiplication arrays also have to do with addition wall it is not here in our glossary but it is a word we talked about a lot
hint it begins with the sound errr so head over to the word wall if you need to see if you can find the math word that has to do with multiplication word yeah does anybody know what that word is what addition repeated addition yes
so we were talking about arrays we were talking about how arrays are part of multiplication and arrays also have something to do with repeated addition right t yeah what were you doing on tuesday ahead good
pointing what letter what letter s he was pointing to the letter s and it was skip counting addition some of you were working on skip counting multiplication and we had talked about that word array which we added to your dictionary your math dictionary
is you know you know what an array is when an angle is across and up and down so you are talking about angles when we were talking about our multiplication on tuesday did we talk about angles at all
no so i think you might be getting confused with that word area or that you brought up earlier right when we talk about area or if we talk about triangles when we talk about angles and things like that that is when we are focusing on geometry which we have seen in morning math and you will see again in the coming weeks but when we talk about arrays they have to do with multiplication
and when we multiply we are going to by the end of today hopefully you will feel comfortable with what an array is today to learn what an array is today to learn what an array is today to learn what an array is
time what an array is today to learn what an array is t it is not about math i want to tell you something what about friday what about the prize box so i am going to go off topic for one minute and then we have to get back to this math
and i am sorry to interrupt but i know this is on some people is mind you we are not doing prize box today we will be doing prize box next week
e i got to keep all the practice wonderful good we are not doing prize box today friday so that means you will a lot of tickets next friday for listening right the other thing is there is no fun friday today cause it is thursday but we will be doing a super wednesday next week
in and we will pick 2 people to go next wednesday this week is star student and next week is star student hi how are you you have rabbit ears and we have one slip today i love them they are beautiful what you can go get a marker
go ahead just a slip just a slip today next week you can get the marker beautiful yes job see you soon i will see you at the end of the day
where is your body supposed to be you so you need to hold on one moment minute so next wednesday i will be picking 2 or you will be picking 2 super stars one for this whole week and one for next week
friday fun friday we are switching to next wednesday and it will be called super wednesday is this about fun friday prize box or math math can i go on the computer to start math no you are doing math here with your group
you have that much time and then you may take a break so i can head downstairs you can head to miss c i said after math all day it is not because then you will have to come back and do your fasst math afterwards what about my math 1st so you are going to do the 35 minutes we have left and then you will do fasst math and then take a break
like for the whole day it will not be the whole day but it will be we will talk about it afterwards we got to get back to math now last question well then we will have to figure that out but we are not going to think about that now we will think about it wednesday you also thought you were going to be out this wednesday and you were not
so maybe you might be here wednesday we are not going to talk about that now e i am finished did you do 2 math games in fasst math
wonderful then you can head over to miss m is table for your math lesson back so listening means eyes on the speaker today learn learn about about arrays arrays can i hear you say that
learn about arrays good learn about arrays so students will be able to use repeated addition yeah and arrays to correctly multiply one digit numbers so the goal for today and i do not have any my 4th graders with their eyes on me
look at over there but you are looking at me as well me if you are not listening you will not get your listening ticket time
it is time for math come on honey look at miss c table put that away and head right over to miss m is table job no you are not going to do the camera
come here well you are kind of beyond the camera go ahead right over to miss m is look the camera is seeing you right now take a picture well it is taking a picture of you right now as you by so take your headphones thank you miss m go sit right here why are you up out of your seat right there no he was fine right there
j 4th graders again eyes up here ready in a minute you are going to be getting up and moving and working on the board interactive you will be able correctly multiply one digit numbers go can everybody see this picture
ladybugs what we have it is very light see it is blue and it is light
ladybugs we have right here the repeated addition and then we also have a multiplication sentence array an array what do you notice about that picture
notice the sum yep you see the sum but i want to know about the ladybugs they are in columns they are in columns you could do like a math equation to figure out how many ladybugs are in all how many ladybugs there are in all
right we are going to try to find out how many ladybugs are there in those key words in all in all that is a word we know a math key word we know from using addition now you know when you see these words in all it also tells you that what kind of problem is it
not just addition it is also multiply multiplication yes me you can count by 2 is or 4 is but the 2 is are easier cause 2 4 6 8 so just like you had mentioned the columns also saw
he saw that you could either put them in groups of 2 or you could put them let me pick a color you can actually see reds or you could put them in groups of 4 4 are they equal groups or are there some left over equal groups are they equal or are there some left over
r rules by the there is a tie a way you could use times to figure out how many count one each each so you could sit there and count how many ladybugs there are
saying so you could count one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 but what happens when you have a number that gives you an answer of say 180 ladybugs would it be quick to count each ladybug if the number is 180 no so multiplication is supposed to make math much quicker and easier for you
work so if you counted independently one 2 3 up to 180 that would take over 180 seconds it could take a long time where if you knew just like and you said that there were groups of 2 or they were even or equal groups of 4 it would take you a lot quicker s you counted by 2 is very quickly you skip counted
r like instead of just count each one this is a way i noticed you could do a times and figure out how and that is what you can use is multiplication decide do you want to use the 2 is or do you want to use the 4 is
we will figure out how many groups one 2 groups 2 there are 2 groups 12 many 4 there are 2 groups of 4
4 so 4 groups so this is saying to do 4 groups of 2 either way that you do it you are still going to get the same answer
that is called the commutative property which we will talk about later on what is that property commutative we use the commutative property even when we do addition i see meaning you can switch the order of these 1st 2 numbers and still get the same answer
so what are we going to add over and over again 2 so we have 2 2 2 2 8 the answer is 8 but let us double check 8 good job
who can tell me what is our multiplication sentence cause you see when you write the 4 and 2 you could do 2 times 4 equals 8 so you could do 2 times 4 equals 8 or the commutative property tells us we can do 4 times 2 equals what 8 so you guys just worked with arrays
you worked with repeated addition and you worked with multiplication one let us look at this this who thinks they can come up how many repeated addition are we going to do huh are we going to do the whole thing by itself no you will get the opportunity
part what part know when the +and the times are you going to do both of them no you are going to do one part and then a partner is going to do the other part group so i want you to do the repeated addition
how many are there
groups stop there for a 2nd
did circle equal groups did what was my direction circle how many groups should there have been 3 what did is he circled groups of 3 which would be another way to solve that
okay but we want you to only circle 3 groups that so you are going to click to clear remember click the and click this button right up at the top groups that is a group of 3
down could you go across you could as long as it is an equal group which with an array it would be group i say 3 rows rows and math with multiplication you are going to hear groups you are going to hear rows you might even hear columns like had said
one i want 3 you are shouting out oops does he have 3 groups or 3 rows how many are in each group
so you have 3 so write that number 3 there cause you have 3 groups or 3 rows row not in all we do not want to know in all just yet
group 3 here is 3 groups 5 how many butterflies are in this row 5 and how many are in this 5 so how many butterflies are in each group 5 and is it equal all the way across
each how many spaces do you have here 3 so what number are you going to repeatedly add the 5 5 what would your answer be how did you get to the 15
15 so he skip counted you could have added 5 +5 is 10 10 +5 is 15 so you could have repeatedly added or you could have skip counted
t let us see who can finish it by writing the multiplication sentence are you watching my lesson or miss m is he is supposed to be watching mine miss m is do you think you know how to get the answer up here do you know what the 3rd graders you will use the board monday today you are working on time
ready come up and write the multiplication sentence whenever you need the write the answer out the answer is up there but the multiplication sentence is not up there yet plenty i have a whole springboard we are going to get to in a couple minutes
you guys are going to be the ones checking
what is the multiplication sentence that wrote to could you write the other addition i am sorry the other multiplication sentence the commutative property by using the commutative property you could actually switch it to black
here he is going to use that commutative property good no
good so what is writing
it is very light did you use black 15 did he use the commutative property job so what he did is he used the factors of 3 and 5
he just switched the order and he got the same products the same answers ready who thinks they can do it
s how many spaces are there 3 so they go across so let us write the 3 here and circle the groups of 3
sorry i understand you want to really go on fasst math right now but it is really important that you listen to this lesson on arrays understand but look you still have 15 minutes and then it is fasst math it are they equal groups
way going down and across 4 how many are in this one
4 can you write it up at the top or is it too high 4 sit down sit down no here like fasst math did you say no you will be fine this computer will be open for fasst math
checks so now that i am aware of it i am going to take checks if you keep shouting out t so 4 +4 +4 and what did put for an answer 12 9 and i put 8
8 so you are going to help us too 8 so thinks 8 to can you show me how you know that it is i do not think it is 8 miss c
8 so if this is 8 we still have one more 4 to add good so take the eraser and erase the 8 and you can make it 12 you need to wait you need to wait cause remember who is up there right now 12 put that away
away and i would like you to use your multiplication chart or skip counting and tell me was he correct in adding
yes you know what use that timer cause this one does not so is he correct
up you are going to write the multiplication sentence can i go get a drink of water that would be a good idea shouted so what are our numbers that we are going to multiply 3 and what would the answer be
12 can you write it using the commutative property see guys you are going to check for him talking i think he is you can look over there
dark can you stop a little early our time is our time as always we do not break the rules
times you know what happened that you did not switch over to the pen 1st way if you are doing it right let us see
did he use the commutative property so his 1st equation was 4 times 3 equals 12 his 2nd equation was 3 times 4 equals 12
not because it is the other way around well when you are writing when he wrote his multiplication sentence 4 times 3 equals 12 you agree that that was right the commutative property all you are doing and this is okay this is a legal a legal not illegal this is a legal math move
lot if you have these factors it does not matter the order of the factors you are going to get the same answer end what did i say you said you switch it the other way around and you still get the same answer right if you switch the factors the order of the factors you still get the same answer
wall i had added the commutative property right here under the c example it actually has the examples and just did 12 3 times 4 is 12
that he just changed the order of the factors if he had 2 totally different factors written down then no but this is starting we are heading towards learning our multiplication and division fact families job do you feel like you understand this so let us now there is one for each of you
you are going to draw an array for this multiplication problem on but before we do that i want to show you 1st an example of one and then i want to see if you can do it
over 0 my goodness why is this doing that here we go sentence
3 times ooh you gave me a hard one 30 because the 0 always stands and when you add 3 times one the 3 always stays that is a rule
exactly when you multiply something by 0 the 0 is put there and then 3 times one t ount by 10s count by 10s how many times 3 3 times so count by 10s for me r do you say it like in the 10s it is like the numbers like 3 times 10 you know the 0
like you put the 3 where the one one you see like so similar to what said yeah where you write the 0 and do the 3 times one so what i am going to do now so you could do repeated addition you could do the skip counting or you could use the rule that talked about
i am going to draw 3 rows of how many 10 my arms going to fall off
why you need an equal number ready and try to keep it together as much as possible and what do i put here
10 did i do it yeah i have 3 groups of 10 arrays you ready to build some arrays
how many minutes is left how many minutes are left 5 here we go t and actually the next person can use the wand solving
r i want you to actually go up and look at the clock cause i think you can answer that question on your own and you are next
be 8 minutes we are going by the 8 you start yours see it might not let you actually no it does not
comes do you all of us to use the wand we are not going to use the wand issue i am not to use the wand i used the it came up on both t click and clear good
go ahead are we allowed to use wand yeah but we are not going to use the wand cause it is not working correctly i might get a harder one
t so how many groups should he have 3 so this 1st one counts a lot of kids think that they do the row of 4 and then they do their 2 but what you do is you do your row of 4 and that counts as one so this is 121212
so you are going to use the eraser and just try to get rid of that last row did you see what he did good we are going to have it is okay just erase it all and then you can do it again honey cause i think you know now i if you i do not know what you did there hold on
we pushed that button i think this is the one we were working in go and here if you feel that you could solve the rest of them at your desk take out a piece of scrap paper or write on the back or your glossary
if you feel like you can sit there pick up with your hand and solve do i write on this back of it yeah just not on the front cause that is where our definitions are but you could definitely use the back for scrap good so solved his does he have 4 groups of 2
good hand it over to and see if you can solve the rest too on the back do i have to do the drawings too or yeah you have to draw the arrays doing come here i am done with the clock you are done telling the time
has good back miss c over there i am actually not sure c let me see
j not right now cause you are finishing the 3rd grade skills you do not have to have one actually in front of you to actually participate so use the other left handed scissors let us look at is are we ready
groups 3 groups how many should be in each going to many 3 groups of one 2 3 4 5 i have a feeling you are not listening yeah i am confusing so look at you have 3 groups but how many dots should you have in each group in total
6 you have 6 so just like did here it i do not know so that is where when i was asking you were you paying attention to yeah that is what was important because he did the same thing honey
his so now count so if you have 3 groups of 5 what is the repeated addition what is the repeated addition
5 5 is because you have 5 +5 +5 equal and so 3 times 5 is next next is where did my calling sticks go yeah you are with miss m
focus on there if the listening bell went off right now i would not be able to give you a ticket why because i am not listening you are not listening to your group thank you go i will let someone do mine no you are going to do yours
12 good job you have how many he has 3 groups of 4
arrays come on you are going to get the fasst math but they are going to continue the spring arrays the whole time for what whole time for like that was because i had a meeting array you can write the product you can write the answer but then you are to draw the array just like everybody else
done might not what are you doing 4 did you flip it over and do any of the other ones
done 6 groups of 2 is 12 job you may now do your fasst math so you can get to miss c no i have told no because we have other things to do honey here we go
you can start fasst math and you are going to work 0 this but listen the 3 of you you are not doing fasst math just yet you are going to come up here and you are going to follow these directions
here this says place come up on you are going to place these tulips in a 4 by 7 array 7 can we help each other you are going to help each other you are going to work together them 4 by 7
can we move that so we can yeah i will move it all the way oops there you go
me you are moving them into an array so like he was thinking move the get 4 and then you can start moving them 7 so how many do i have there 3 4 5 6 7 do i have 7
7 move the flower good and look at are they in the rows they yeah you want to try to keep them as close together cause they want to you want them to look like a rectangle
rectangle so when you do it watch watch you have to watch
drag not really hard but click drag click drag
now and you could be looking on your multiplication chart for the answer cause i am not going to let you count one by one by one are there enough no
did when you moved this somehow the cow is standing on the goat you i think he wanted to eat for himself so get it away from him before he eats it t does he have equal rows now
get i want you to go check 7 yes cause you have mister a today as well at 2 30 so you do one game and then go to miss c before mister a 10 minutes 28
28 good are we ready for the next one next put those easter eggs in a 4 by 4 4 yeah you might have to check the bunny but i do not think he has any
timer not right this 2nd does the bunny have one
that why did you know he might have one hidden why did you know it it you may have found it but you are not listening to my question how did you know one was missing and what do you need when you are doing an array a 4 not just 4 you need equal groups what do you need
it the bunny and i saw it a little bit that rabbit he is hopping away but he stole it go and what now go back to your multiplication chart unless you can do skip counting
4 no you can not until you are done with the game turn i am giving everybody here a listening ticket
how about me did your whole group earn a listening ticket it sounds like you had some difficulty with your listening so i can not give you a ticket for that so maybe in this next round remember there is one more timer going for listening attention and go back how do you click back you click the next button right here
this what is the array you need to do here
go today our essential question is what is a decimal everybody copy your essential question okay
what is a decimal did everybody copy that
okay well we ve been talking about fractions for the last 2 or 3 weeks have but what i really should have written was what is a decimal fraction okay because really a decimal is just another way of writing a fraction
fraction you know how to read fractions how to convert them from mixed to improper and proper to mixed how to reduce them all of that well today we re going to learn about a new kind of number called a decimal fraction fraction you use decimals all the time but you might not know it
when you re writing money when you re writing a money amount so you re showing dollars and cents you see that little dot that you use to separate the dollars and the cents yes okay well that little dot for example if i have $5.25 this little dot here is called a decimal point
called a decimal and what it does is it separates the dollars from the cents everything on this side shows that these are cents those are dollars on the other side
go a decimal is another way of writing a fraction
it s another way to show that you have a part of something it s another way of writing a fraction the thing about decimals is this we usually use most all decimals really are fractions of either 10s or 100s or 1000s or powers of 10 we don t really use decimals of like 5 or 6 or something
it s always a decimal of 10s or 100s or 1000s so a decimal is another way of writing a fraction
example can we write this go ahead and write the example if i have 4 and 2 tenths of something if i have 4 and 2 tenths we re not answering questions yet if i have 4 and 2 tenths of something right we know that the 4 is a whole number right
it means i have 4 whole things and i have 2 tenths of the other thing i can write this instead of writing 2 tenths i can write this 2 tenths as a decimal i want you to watch what i m going to do fraction if i were to write that as a decimal here s what i would do
number instead of writing this 2 tenths i m going to put a dot my decimal and i m going to put the number 24 and 2 tenths if i should write it as a decimal would be 4 notice the 4 whole is still the same but instead of writing 210th i use .2 this .2 is the exact same thing as 2 tenths that s all that is
it s just another way of writing a fraction of tenths or hundredths today we re not going to talk about hundredths we re only going to do fractions of tenths i m going to show you how to write decimals that are fractions that are tenths here s how you read a decimal 4.2 that 4.2 here s another way you can say it
you can say 4 and 2 tenths what s another way you can say it 4 and 2 tenths just like when we read a mixed fraction we know that this mixed fraction and your eyes 4 and 2 tenths is the same thing but just written another way we can say 4.2 or we can say 4 and notice i said and when i got to the decimal and this .2 means 2 tenths does everybody have that
okay now today what i want to focus on is how to write decimals that are tenths we re going to put some tenths on the board and we re going to show what they look like as a decimal example if i had 7 tenths of something everybody write 7 tenths in your book
if you had 7 tenths of something and you wanted to write that as a decimal here is what you would do point what number is this on the numerator 7 and you put the numerator
7 tenths is the same thing as .7 decimal i put a decimal and i put the number 7 yeah when you re writing decimals we don t need to write the denominator
why instead of writing the 10 on the bottom we had to hold that in our head and remember that the number that is right next to the decimal is 10 it s another way of using place value we don t use a numerator and a denominator we simply use a dot and place value to tell us what we re writing so .7 that means we re talking about 7 tenths
i m going to put the word tenths over that so you will know that this number right here .7 is 7 tenths it s another way of writing 7 tenths if that s the way to write 7 tenths could someone tell me how would i write please put your hands down and wait till i put the problem on the board how would i write 2 tenths as a decimal
2 decimal 2 or .2 okay if this is how i write 2 tenths 2 tenths is .2 what do you think 3 tenths would be 3.3
here if there s no whole number here you could put a 0 to show that i don t have any whole things understand i tend not to start off with a 0 because sometimes it gets you confused
do i m going to erase all of this take this all off and we re going to start with 110th and we re going to go all the way to 10 tenths and we re going to write them as decimals together everybody write 110th in your notebook 110th we re going to write fractions as decimals
way 110th is everybody write one decimal everybody write 2 tenths is .2 everybody write that a decimal is just another way of writing a fraction of tenths
everybody write 3 tenths that is going to be .3 everybody write 4 tenths i have 4 tenths if i want to write that as a decimal that is going to be .4
is if i have 5 tenths it s going to be .5 if i have 6 tenths that is going to be .6 that s so easy if i have 7 tenths that s going to be .7
if i have 8 tenths i can write it as .8 if i have 9 tenths i can write it as .9 minute i m going to stop right here because i don t generally like to start off with the harder concept
easy all i need you to know today is that a decimal is another way of writing a fraction and if you have a fraction like 110th that is simply the same as one okay now everybody take a look something what if i were to erase everything on the board
board what if i were to give you a decimal try we re going to start on put your hands down is if i have .7 what would that be as a fraction
7 tenths that would be 7 tenths you are correct job if i had .9 what would that be as a fraction 9 tenths that would be the same as 9 tenths what if i had .33 tenths that would be the same thing as 3 tenths what if i had .8
be 8 tenths it would be 8 tenths what if i had one be 110th it would be the same thing as 110th you need to sit up be 5 tenths that would be 5 tenths what if i had .6
be 6 tenths that would be 6 tenths what if i had .2 be 2 tenths that would be 2 tenths what if i had .4 be 4 tenths that would be 4 tenths and what if i had one 2 3 4 5 6 7 yeah i think we have all 9 of them there
i m not going to tell you about 10 tenths yet because it s a little different job now i m going to take all this off and i m going to do something else i m going to now give you a fraction and you have to tell me what the decimal is k what if you saw this if i had a decimal and i had the decimal .3
be that would be 3 tenths that would be 3 tenths what would .4 be 4 tenths teacher 4 tenths what would .5 be 5 tenths it would be 5 tenths okay good up you re going to do the opposite of what they did
i m going to give you the tenths and you re to tell me what it would be as a decimal go starting with if you had 7 tenths can you tell me what that is as a decimal 7 okay 0.7 or .7 if you had 8 tenths what would that be as a decimal
8.8 if you had 4 tenths what would that be as a decimal 4 it would be .4 if you had 2 tenths what would that be as a decimal .2 it would be .2
if you had 9 tenths as a fraction what would it be as a decimal 9 i ll put my decimal in the right place .9 if i had 3 tenths what would that be as a decimal .3 3 if i had 5 tenths what would that be as a decimal
5 it would be .5 if i had 6 tenths as a fraction how would i write that as a decimal 6 it will be .6 if i had 110th how would i write that as a
one and what if i had let s see one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91 what would be 9 tenths be as a decimal .9
and what would 3 tenths be as a decimal right if you see 7 tenths you know it s what .7 if you see 8 tenths you know it s .8
9 if you have 4 tenths it s .4
on now we re learning how to write decimals or fractions rather as decimals this sometimes when you re doing fractions you have a mixed fraction you have a whole number and you have a fraction bit we re going to learn how to write a mixed number or a mixed fraction as a decimal
it s the same concept but this time you re going to have a whole number in front of the decimal right this if i had 3 and 5 tenths can someone tell me how will i write that as a decimal number watching i write my whole number 3 and i know that 5 tenths is .5
so 3 and 5 tenths as a decimal number is 3.5 is now i m going to put a few more on the board and i m going to give you a chance to come to the board and write those mixed fractions because this time you re going to have something in the whole number place this this says 3 and 5 tenths right
3.5 if there s nothing in the decimal place we could put a 0 there and say nothing and .5 that if there s no whole number here you could put a 0 there because there s nothing there go someone come to the board and write 7 and 2 tenths as a decimal
7 and 2 tenths write that as a decimal good job someone come to the board and write 4 and 4 tenths as a decimal number
job come to the board and i need you to write 8 and 5 tenths as a decimal good job
i want you to come and write 4 and 2 tenths as a decimal i need you to come and write 6 and 8 tenths as a decimal
job i want you to come and write 2 and 110th as a decimal good job i want you to come and write 3 and 9 tenths as a decimal we re writing fractions as decimals using a decimal point
okay good come and write 12 and 8 tenths as a decimal okay that was pretty easy off you know how to write these fractions as decimals 3.58 and 5 tenths is
8.54 and 2 tenths is 4.22 he has a 2 here but it kind of looks like a one 7.24 and 4 tenths is 3.915 and 3 tenths is
okay now i m going to do just one last thing before i give you your worksheet go i m going to put some decimals on the board and i m going to see if you can tell me what that would be as a fraction right so if you have not come to the board if you have come to the board please give the other students who did not get a chance to come to the board to come
hand all right i m going to put some decimals and now you have to make it back into a fraction 8.4 who can tell me what that is as a fraction fraction 8.4 if i wanted to make it back into a fraction what would it be
job if i had 19.3 how would that look as a fraction thank you if i had 2 and 7 tenths no i m doing it wrong
decimals if i had 3.5 what would that look like as a fraction exactly very easy but you have to stop and think sometimes
if i had 4.4 tell me what that would look like as a fraction please
job if i had 15 one what would that look like as a fraction good job
come to the board and tell me what 7.8 would look like as a fraction
good come and tell me what 12.9 would look like as a fraction good job
come and tell me what 14.3 would look like as a fraction it s okay you 14 and 3 tenths come and tell me what 9 one would be as a fraction
come and do 7.6 as a fraction put your equal sign to show that they re equal to each other
and i need you to come and do 10.4 as a fraction
me i need you to tell me what 9.8 would be as a fraction board we re going to look at our decimals and say what they are as fractions
is 3.5 equals 35 tenths 3 and 5 tenths don t forget your and one 4.4 equals 4 and 4 tenths okay it s not reading time baby one 14.3 equals 14 and 3 tenths very good i need you to read this one
10.4 equals 10 and 4 tenths good one 15 one equals 15 and 110th okay i need you to read this one 12.9 equals 12.9 tenths 12 and 9 tenths i need you to read this one
9 one equal 9 and 110th i need you to read this one 7.8 equals 7 and 8 tenths i need you to read this one 3.5 equals 3 and 5 tenths okay please listen
desk and i need you to take out your soft covered purple math books we re going to turn to the following page and we re going to do the practice page
take out your soft covered math books on we re all the way in the back in the decimal section of the book
i need you to turn to page 94 i think i have yours do not take the page out of this it has tomorrow s lesson on it
94 please write your name at the very top this all right students in your book they have a model that shows tenths those long decimal strips
one page 94 put your fingers on number one let s read it says relate fractions and decimals it says write the decimal and fraction shown by each model or number line you know how we looked at fractions on a number line
also we re going to do only number one and 2 only numbers one and 2 all right the directions are write the decimal and the fraction shown by each model one count how many shaded parts there are
tenths every time you see those 10 long strips it s talking about a decimal that is made of tenths that yeah they have shaded in some of the parts and they left some of the parts un shaded
6 there s 6 of them that 6 out of 10 fraction 6 bars or strips long strips are shaded out of 10 so as a fraction that would be 6 tenths
that yes they want you to write 1st as a fraction and then as a decimal on that same line 6 tenths yes now can you please write that as a decimal decimal write it and then raise your hand and tell me what you wrote 6 if you wrote .6 you were correct
i wrote 0.6 yet go to the next one number 2 parts write the fraction how much out of 10 and then write the decimal
finished tell me what you wrote you re supposed to have a fraction and a decimal write tell me what you have on your paper have for 2 huh one
good you should have you should have 110th that s the fraction and you should also have it as a decimal which is one now we cannot do 3 and 4 because that is talking about hundredths we haven t done hundredths yet what i m going to do now is we re going to stop right here because we have to go take our pictures
okay just read what it says and try to understand it 306 and 5 tenths 600 thousandths i asked them to write the words on the place value charts i had it up here
know this is my decimal which would be the word and and this is just a review so we should not be struggling like we have been struggling carefully after tenths what place value is it
me it says 1000th show me what 1000 would look like let me put some lines across for you
is 1000 a whole number yes the next one over on this side can you show me 6 and 55 hundredths did you do that one me anyone not understand where to place 1000
k 18 and 7 tenths excellent you are just following the whole number that is 18
no is that 6 thousandths or 600 thousandths 6 tenths it is not 6 tenths you read the number 1st
9 and 4 thousandths let me see what you do frustrated just read it and make sure you are writing it exactly like you are reading it excellent 9 and 4 thousandths that is the way you are reading it it is not 400th thousandths it is just 4 thousandths number 7
7 and 4 tenths you want to try it one everyone agree with that
70 and 4 tenths number 8
35 hundredths yeah we have to do that
now is that correct no
is you read the number then the place value hundredths good 99
is that correct yes
99 okay 9 and 42 hundredths good is that correct yes
9 and 42 hundredths you read it exactly as if it were a whole number then you put in the place value
10 and 60 hundredths good job all right i did a little review on that this morning because i noticed some of you are still afraid to read numbers and you should not be afraid to read numbers you have to remember their place values remember when we were doing the civil war some of you were afraid to say 600
like write that down in numbers be just write the number down on the side of that paper 600000 what does 600000 look like
me put it up on that side just write the number number some of us are not sure what that number was this morning
yes okay all right today we are going to be i want you to put that away now
sheet math madness what page were you on yesterday
quickly page 32
number okay everyone have page 32 in their math madness book
now all right let us look at the 1st one how many of you did not do this yet math madness 32 together this is where you should be right now okay
31 let us look on number one t all right read the 1st one
1st of all what is the fraction of the stars that are shaded you which of the following has an equivalent fraction of shaded parts what does equivalent mean
a b 3 fifths what is c d 3 fourths so we have got to decide which one of these is equivalent to 4 sixths how can we find that out
ways you have to divide and then multiply wait divide by what 2 divided into 3 3 divided into 5 5 divided into no d i eliminated the multiples of 3 i mean the multiples of 6
you know what makes 6 on i would have eliminated 3 fourths okay eliminated and 5 thirds 3 fifths 3 fifths how are you eliminating them
them and then i would eliminate 13rd so your answer would be 2 thirds does anyone else have a way to find out the equivalents of 4 sixths it says a fraction of these stars are shaded
d i would count to 3 until i got 6 as my denominator and 2 times 2 is 4 and 3 times 2 is 6 so you would use the same multiple right you would say what for this you would do 2 times 2
2 times 2 would give you 4 and 3 times 2 would give you 6 okay if i said 3 times 2 that would not be so right would it way anyone else tell me another way you can find the equivalent fraction
draw pictures come up and show me how you drew a picture to show me that
remember we talked about pictures and how you can draw what is that
up you show me yours and then you show me yours
do you basically did what he did as well
that still would not tell me if it was 3 fifths 13rd or 4 fifths and you have part of what you are trying to show me you have the little concept there but you have got to do the complete concept of it picture i have got to know even if i drew that is that still telling me because some of us have a seat
ms j i think it is 3 fifths some of us might have said 13rd some of you may have said 3 fourths i did not ask you who said a b c or d
did not if you are using a model such as this i would have to do 2 thirds 3 fifths 13rd 3 fourths and i want to see if they are equal to 4 sixths so i am going to put this one here 1st i am going to do my 4 sixths and they have to be equal parts
those 3 fourths i have to have equal parts it is a little bit too much 13rd i have to do 3 equal parts shaded in so you have the concept of it but that would not tell me anything
that is just once you knew the answer i am trying to get to the answer 3 fifths and 5 pieces 3 of those are shaded in and 2 thirds
12 thirds this and this are equal right that is one way what were you saying now i thought that was both ways both answers because 3 fifths that is what you were trying to show me i hope that is what you were trying to show me because what you were doing you were just showing me the correct answer
if you are using this model you have to use every fraction and you have to that will determine which is equivalent
said you can change them to decimals to see if they are equivalent
0.66 and it keeps going on and on what was 3 fifths once you found it what was 4 sixths when you used your calculator
0.66 excellent that is another way of using it good you have got to do each one way division
calculator you also could use your multiplication chart to simplify simplify good job one god bless you number 2 by show of hands read number 2 for me
which of the following numbers would make the statement are we looking for a number that is less than or greater than that number okay can you read that number for me
that look at this number and everyone read that number for me excellent read it again
good now what we are looking for is a number that is less than because it has a symbol like that d your answer is c
4510039 is less than that all right let us look at number 3 read number 3 for me
it says cassandra sold 100 tickets to a play 60 of which were adult tickets in simplest form what fraction of the tickets sold were adult tickets question divide 60 into 100 divide what we have to do what
divide all our answers you said divide all the answers what do you mean divide all the answers
if i divide a b c and d using my calculator divide all the answers is that going to give me an answer answer because it has to be equal to 60 hundredths good
so we are looking for a number that is 60 hundredths that is why i wrote that up there we have to find that and we are looking for the simplest form
fraction how you have to divide 60 no 100 into 60 right would that give me my simplest form if i divided 100 into 60 or would that give me a decimal a decimal i am not looking for a decimal what am i looking for form so how am i going to find the simplest form
you have to minus a 0 can anyone tell me how to find the simplest form do is that the right answer no out i thought you had to multiply no
get how many said a would be the right answer 2 fifths how many said b 3 fifths how many said c 6 tenths how many said d 60 hundredths listen carefully with it said cassandra sold 100 tickets to the play
tickets 60 of the tickets were adult tickets 60 of those tickets that she sold were adult tickets we are just trying to simplify this number this fraction
it you divide it until it gets down to the lowest number the lowest fraction how do i all right i am going to try to do it the easy way use your multiplication chart and simplify 61 hundredths you have the numbers right there
chart i told you to keep it in your book bag
c 6 tenths what do you do to get 6 tenths now that we have the answer you have got to go to the chart and find 100 then find 60 and go straight across if i did not have the multiplication chart which we did not use no
60 and 100 what do i have to find with both of those numbers no factors 10s you divide 10 into both of them right and then i would get what 6 tenths can you take that any lower yes
how far what do i have to do to find the common i divide 6 into 2 and 10 into it equals what 4 fifths no 3 fifths can i take it any simpler
one i can not take it any further what is the simplest form look at number 3 again
carefully cassandra sold 100 tickets to a play 60 of which were adult tickets in simplest form what fraction of the tickets sold were adult tickets there 3 fifths yeah 3 fifths stop shouting it out answer even though 6 tenths was there was that the simplest form
no it had to go to the simplest form which is 3 fifths you can take it down even lower the answer was 3 fifths number 4 read number 4 for me
read number 4 okay about how many
how many said a for number 4 page you are sitting there and you are not answering the questions here it says £9 of clay are needed to make a model about how much clay is needed to make 21 models
then work the problem do not tell me you are finished
no using the words about how many what are we going to do
it so if we have £9 of clay and we want to know about how much clay is needed to make £21
okay so about how many do has everyone finished how many people said a we are going to need £3000
b how many said c £300
pounds i rounded you rounded what to what
do 9 times 20 would give me what 180 so is that what you did
9 is that about how many or is that the exact amount 200 we can do it that way what is another way to estimate it to round it
10 21 can be rounded to 20 then you multiply 20 times 10 and that is where you get what 200 you were close but you did not round the other part
let us look at number 5 we have been having problems with elapsed time
me joanna come up and show me how you would do that
1st okay ended at 10 40
so we want to know usually we talk about when something starts and when it ends i have been looking at that all day we are trying to make a phone call now to your house lesson you have been out of control for 2 hours
did he ask if he could go to the bathroom did he go to the bathroom yeah he got right up out of his seat did he ask you no me did he ask you for that please do not use that in here we are doing math and no one is giving me an answer to anything whether we are in small groups or not you should still be focused
focused everything is on tape here today health you are on your best behavior because this is how you are
page this is just a review and we are taking all of our math time doing this because some of you are saying you did not do it and the ones that said you did not do it are not trying to do it now you are just sitting around playing around doing nothing and when you do nothing you learn nothing
review excuse me i am talking what happened okay go ahead go back to this concert if the concert ended at 10 40 pm and was one 45 long what time did it begin
does everyone agree with that
yes no
okay show me what you can do
leave that there
it says joanna went to a concert if the concert ended at 10 40 pm and the concert was one 45 minutes long what time did it begin
yours said it started at 9 35 pm
yet you have a pencil is that correct no okay is that the way that is not how you subtract correctly
okay then put it there let me see a timeline do not put it on that page can you do timelines all right just do the subtraction at the end of that is it 10 40
10 40 is the ending time
subtracting yes okay me no i am saying you are doing the same thing did and then we have to finish up
quiet we are not subtracting correctly 1st of all with those 2 that just did the subtracting for time
ms w has been working with you with elapsed time and we have to continue to work on that because it is not getting there
listen one 45
what could have been a different way you could have taken this approach way do you see the times a b c and d if you were not sure times if you were not sure how to find the ending time or the beginning time start with the starting time
9 5 you could have started at 9 5 until when did it end manner you could have used each one of those starting times what one 45

let us go to the back really quick for our calendar
see all right
not one more but 100 more not 1000 more but 100 more because i am seeing little mistakes
answer all right one 2 3 show me
more do you have that good more some of you all did this and then wrote the number down and put 4564 and 54 hundredths everyone look on your boards
you need to be able to find and look up here okay what is in the 100s place here it is asking you to go 100 more
yes you can look at we are not rounding yes 100 just go up one more easy then simply write down the rest of the numbers
why it is actually a value of 100 and you are going up 100 in the what
7 now let us see if we can do 1000 more than this number
you let me see yours
it i am waiting on one other person 0 all right can you show him really quick
everyone else let me see yours all right place it is right here and if you are adding 1000 to it you go up by what
number we can even test this theory or thought process
if you want to do it the long way do you see why this is a nice shorter quicker way if you still want to do it the long way that is okay but i want you to get to the point where you are getting it the shorter way because that shows me that you are getting the concept of what you can do
okay what is this number rounded to the nearest 100 what is the 1st thing you have got to do when looking at that number
you see some markers still moving aside that way i know you are done one 2 3 show me
dude all right very good place there it is right now when we go to our 100s place we have got to look to our neighbor if it is 5 or more we have got to do what raise add one more
so add one more to the 6 and you get 7 the rest of the numbers you simply copy down as zeros heads good now what is this number
round it to the nearest 1000s if you can do the 100s you can most certainly do the 1000s
challenge you can show me that you are done when you cap up that marker you can do it
impressed you recognized this 1000s place go to the neighbor next door 5 or more add one more just fill in the rest with zeros great now this will get you right here
remember everyone can get this part right here no problemo it is when you get here that you all go whoops pay very careful special attention to your decimals see
if you need to write down the number and do it the long way to keep the number straight in your head then do that please if you need to write the number 4 then count 3 zeros after it then do so
yes write down the whole number write down the 4 and count one 2 3 okay
you girl thank you
did not check this one right here
be that is where everyone gets tricked right here in the hundredths place easy must have been that spring break packet
tenths easy then this is where you all kind of fall to the wayside 100s therefore you can not write it like that because this represents what 10s in order to make it 100s you have got to put the 0 as your place holder in front of it and then the 4 and now what do you have
4 hundredths is that what place that is in what 4 hundredths okay give me the value of the pink digit
money it should be like a breeze
one 2 3 along what is the place of the yellow digit
place erase that all right
easy one 2 3 show me done 500 less than this number right up here if you can do the 100 then you should know what to do with the 500 less what subtraction
less
understand i still see some markers moving 0 you got it me part of your work i think everyone has got it right
subtract we know the 5 is 500 so subtract the 100s place and just copy everything else sense what is 10 times this number
what bigger do we need to actually go crazy with the multiplication if you do then you will notice a pattern but if you know the pattern already you do not need to get crazy with the multiplication it is easy
folks you have this already at your old school
it they would do the decimals got you do you see how she did that
go all right one 2 3 show me make sure you have adjusted your comma to the right place let me see
good the power of 10 watch this okay
must there is your 1st one magic 0 3 4 3 5 6 4 2 numbers after the decimal one 2 there we go wow you just took a long time for you to be able to do this
if i took the same number watch count the zeros right here one this indicates that you are going to move the decimal space over by one and remember our number is getting bigger therefore we should move this direction
that yes 101 space now adjust your comma right there yes 46535 and 4 tenths beautiful now do 100 times this number
you she is such a cool breeze she is done
late pat yourself on the back please the only you have to do one 2 3 comma
one 2 3 show me now make sure your comma is in the correct spot
okay all right you simply what 2 therefore your decimal spot is going to go one 2 number adjust your commas who can say this number for me please
465354 all right challenge me wondered what is half this number
all right prove me wrong i want to be proved wrong 1st of all you have to know what to divide by right nudge if you are going to put something in half what number do you divide by
divide by 2
out this is going to have some decimals going on is not it
1st of all is this going to divide evenly seriously do you remember our divisibility test
up do not forget your decimal sit down i just want you all to hold it up
off you are so close okay everyone put your whiteboards and markers down
out when we say i am waiting skill okay listen to me when something says to divide half of something or what is half of this half is 2 got it you can divide it into 2
so if we start doing our division and you are all going look at this big long number it is 2 right here do i know if i am going to wind up with all these crazy decimals or in some cases a remainder number and it ends in an even number so this is an even number
s so 2 times 2 is 4 equals 0 bring down that 6 3 times 2 equals 6
5 that does not go evenly but 2 is the closest down 6 times 2 is 12
me 7 times 2 is 14 one bring down the 4 and low and behold 7 no all right let us go back over what we were working on yesterday
all okay remember expressions yesterday input output right it started out really easy and got harder
organized i am going to count by 3 and i want to see you with eager faces waiting to stare at the board like here you are used to me writing it like this
i can use a better marker way now i am going to do it just a little different sideways i am going to use the symbols for what we call the what
okay 1st step i want you to do what is that
here we are going from bigger to smaller you division or subtraction here go ahead on your whiteboard and see what you can do solve it for this unknown right here
long just a quick little review
okay one 2 3 show me you are usually lickety split i like the way you did that
too hold on what not 6 but what 6 how do you figure that
3 what is it no what should it be l does that make sense
it i did not hear you out so far so good
you are probably looking at this going that sure is a lot of trouble for just a simple one right here but why am i asking you to go through all this trouble for a simple one s to see if they are all equal to that number huh but remember yesterday when it got complicated
stepper now if you write divide by 3 we are good if you want to take it up a notch and go x divided by 3 equals y that is even better because this is the way you are going to have to learn it
that it has got to look like this okay now what you are going to do is you are going to create your own little input output chart one 2 3 4 5 squares yes when you get that finished you are going to trade with your elbow partner and see if your elbow partner can figure out your puzzle and the rule just like here okay
idea there you go i will figure it out
what if some people do not know how to do it
out quickly because we only have 5 minutes to work out our friend is puzzle
good just wait for now
e come on
blank did you check each other good she has got to figure out that last answer for you go now you can get going did you all get to trade yet
yes we did all right come on
start by picking some numbers here and put them in there and you can do something like you understand it has got to be consistent though
here there is only one rule out she got it down write the rule down then you figured it rule did get yours no
no huh 18 times 3
concept good now leave the last one open and let us trade with
rule you can not just stop and call it a day right he can kill it
47 as we do as always who would like to come up and do one
it take anything up there that you would like to do
up how many place values do you have in your answer 4 how come you crammed in 13 like this this 100s read this number
1360 is there a decimal there read it again 32306 but you understand what i m talking about with you put it all under the 100s
over boys and girls do not cram your answers you cram your answers you get in that habit now it s a bad habit complex can you tell us why what those little dashes are on top of those place values
yeah what place value is this 10s what place value is that 100s what are these things on top there i put them there because when the you re right but i want to know why you did what you did
are you copying something that a teacher has done or why in your head explain to me why you did that up there i put that up there because when i put the 6 here whenever it s 60 i put the 6 here and the one next to it
10 okay so the number 16 has how many ones one okay so continue so why did you regroup over here
how much does this all add up to 7 +one +210 okay so the number 10 how many ones does the number 10 have in it
0 how many groups of 10 does it have one so then you had to regroup because you couldn t put a 10 there could you continue so i had to put the 0 here and put the one up top which was regrouping one grouping of 10 okay then why the 13
because 8 +4 is 12 +one is 13 so you put the 13 over there you put the 3 in the 100s and the 11000 in the 1000s place
values how did you go from 2 digit to a 3 digit
10 good then i put 8 +9 okay so what is your answer 200 good job
who wants to do another one go ahead ooh he is brave
voice why did you choose multiplication
what wording in there told you that it would be multiplication in gym class 5 teams of 9 children were formed for a basketball tournament how many children were on all 5 teams
okay so how did you know it was multiplication how did you say 0 it s multiplication that very good
it what was the actual problem what was it asking you to do it was asking you to so in order to do that what did you have to do 1st i had to so you had to solve the smaller equations so it looks simple but it really wasn t once you actually solved the problem
do on this side with these you had to know how to do what you had to do times multiplication how about these you had to divide so therefore you re doing what was that special word that we use
excellent here we go for the next word problem phones or cars class do you think there are more phones owned by your classmates families or are there more cars write a reason for your answer and estimate the total number of phones and cars
family we have 3 cars in my family my car my husband s car and my son s car but i have a phone my daughter has a phone my husband has a phone my son has a phone and so do we have more phones or cars
phones so how many of you in here have a phone but you don t have a car because you don t have a license 0 so write a problem to match that
class 2626 children so out of 26 children how many cars to you think of in this classroom car is there anybody in here that does not have a car assumption can we make a guess that there s at least every family has at least how many cars
one right is there anybody in here that has more than one car cars all right is there anybody in here that has 3 cars cars anybody in here that has 5 cars
cars so the number of cars as it goes up the hands get less but is there anybody in here that has at least one car in their family cars now think about the phones head talk about it amongst your group for a 2nd and come back with an equation
it talk to it gets written here anywhere anywhere here
it all right good s the problem says write a reason for your answer
do you think there are more phones owned by your classmates families or are there more cars write a reason for your answer and estimate a total number of phones and cars be let s see if their educated group guess is about the same as what you guys came up with
you think there are 35 cars and 38 phones how many of you came up with the same thing cars than cars more phones than cars i have i have phones i have 4 phones to 3 cars
ratio what s ratio all right go sit down
it good how many of you lost it i m passing out more paper for you because we re going to be going over it
if you need to correct you can
7 see if you guys remember
problem are you adding are you subtracting don t let the camera make you nervous teaching i m still going i m just blocking it out because it s not there m no i want to know what you know about it
why what s the function putting 7 into 88 what s the function so what s the function what think about it a what s the operation what s the operational side
division so you re right it is the inverse relationships to multiplication which is division and you re not putting something into something
subtraction when you re making a number doubled or bigger addition good what are you doing to numbers when you re doing multiplication times times but what are you doing with the number that s a repeated something repeated what addition addition
addition now division is completely different from all of them but what are you doing when you re dividing a number you re not seeing how many times 7 goes into into how many of you have heard a teacher say goes into 0 good because you re not going into anything
you re taking which portion of this problem and breaking it up new we just started this concept but we re going to continue with it
doing what is this part called dividend dividend what are you doing with the dividend what is this part called divisor what are you doing to the dividend with the divisor
well that s one way to solve it but what else are you doing groups you re breaking this into smaller parts
yes i can take 88 and say great i m going to break it up into little groups of 2 no why can t i take 88 and say all right i m going to make groups of 2 why can t i do that
can because it takes a longer time yeah it doesn t make sense 4s i want to take this problem and i just want to say all right 4s does that make sense no what tells you how many are going to be in a group what number
yesterday the 7 divisor so this drives how many are going to be in each group
so 7 is the divisor and goes into the dividend and it drives how many are going to be in a group so how many groups are you going to have what is that called this is the divisor this is the dividend what s that part called
the quotient the quotient what s the quotient the quotient is the answer all right who wants to come up and try it
remember if you come up and try it you have to stand next to me and explain it it s not good enough to memorize what the teacher has done
if you cannot explain it if you cannot use the vocabulary words like divisor dividend quotient groupings and explain the hows and whys you re just copying you re not learning it
into go ahead there s an 8 here and a 7 here and since this is an 8 and a 7 is smaller than an 8 i can make groups and then i put the answer groups up here
into it goes into is not a mathematical term right this number 8 is larger than so the 1st number in the dividend if it s larger than this the divider then the divider can go into it and it can easily make one group of it
good anybody have a different answer what did you do with the 4 left over dividing something yummy i hope over all right that was an i
one now let s take a look at number 2 now that was a boys so now we re going to look at a girls
girl you re not a girl but thank you for volunteering
since you were so great to come up and do it pick somebody anybody in the audience to try to explain it go ahead you can t pick because he s already done it once else okay let s see
she subtracted 8 -8 and got 0 why did she put these numbers up here to show that she subtracted them okay so how many groups if she had 8 things and she wanted groups of 8 how many groups of 8 was she able to make
one then she brought down that group of 8 and again how many groups of 8 was she able to make one good excellent we ve been talking about something which is division
division student subtract i mean multiplication okay question remember i told you there s always a check we did our subtraction we did a check with addition
it here is 7 times 12 equals 84 and then i and the answer is 88 from it s from what problem okay so the 7 is actually what portion of it
it the divisor yeah and where did the 12 come from called the quotient good so i took the divisor and the quotient and multiplied them
from it came from the remainder very nicely done yes what is the one thing you all should be saying to yourself i need to go home and practice my what facts facts now if you don t know your facts what s another skills that you can do temporarily that you all need to do what
your facts but if you don t know them very well what could you do practice practice them but if you re in the middle of a test and you can t use a book you can t use your agenda what can you do on the side of the paper divisions so in this case what multiplication facts would it be
okay who wants to try to find the answer to this one it go ahead
okay great where did you get the 11 from what part of this problem they have to roll off your lips just like inverse relationships just like regrouping just like renaming this it s a fun word to say
you hardly ever get to use that sound turn and ask a buddy ask somebody who has their hand up it doesn t have his hand up
from the quotient where did the 11 come from say quotient you never do get to use the qu sound everyone should know quotient where did the 8 come from
from the divisor good job excellent now what is the answer in this case yes but what is this matching problem you ve got the quotient you ve got the divisor and you got the
dividend dividend very good okay up here dividend quotient divisor it s here you are responsible when you are explaining any of this you need to use those words
those are also words that i expect you when you re writing when you re doing one of those tests that we give you you know those awful tests on division and it says to explain how you do it now explaining but also doing and we re also proving the answers picture we could make 88 items
what would the array of 88 look like 8 rows of 11 and then you would divide them accordingly
if it wanted you to divide them into 7s you would block out 7 and another group of 7 and it would show you with 4 left over
questions all right we need this one done
i need a boy and i need a girl because now we re doing 3 and 4 girl who do i want for a girl see let me see
luck can there ever be a remainder of there is now it 4 is higher than 3 but i still don t understand that
there what does the one represent so what does the one represent represents anybody
s what does that one represent one wait yeah it represents the how many times i don t understand goes into group so how many groups you can make
so you have 4 items i want a group of 3 how many groups can i make one so this is the grouping how many groups are you going to be able to make with 3 things in each group if you have 4 things
go 3 times one is and the closest number is so how many groups did you make if you have 18 things and you have 3 things in each group how many groups were you able to make with that number
okay okay so out of 48 items 3 things in each group how many groups were you able to make 3 what is 48 the dividend very good
question your question was can you ever have a remainder of 0 yes yes so needless to say there is a remainder of 0
who would like to come in and show this answer what s the inverse relationship of division it do you know what you re multiplying because you weren t here for us
nice excellent see problem if you can go halfway around and solve a problem you can continue the circle and find if you did it right
so is there any reason why these should be done without these
i need a girl come on i need a volunteer don t make me pick i need a girl volunteer you already went up right
picked you i m sorry say thank you thank you
what are you doing you haven t put anything at the top
0 thank goodness that made me nervous okay go ahead what times tables are you thinking about okay run them through your head 2 times what will get you close to 11 do your times tables 2 times 12 times 2
don t sit there for a long period of time and look at a blank piece of paper sleep actively keep in engaged in the process of thinking
you know how to do it skip count by 224 good
addition excellent keeping your brain engaged even when you say to yourself ugh i don t remember it there s always a way to find the answer trying keep trying different things and eventually you ll say 0 i ve got it
right it s 2468 okay 10 good answer so you have to be higher or lower than that
lower okay so what factor are you going to use up in your quotient okay so which one are you how are you going to put it
what are you putting up in the quotient 2 times what equals 10 100 cause 2 times 11 is 22 good go prove it
there don t even give me that actually explain how she did it then you can show us the check dividend one nope
dividend nope that s called the divisor so where the dividend yes so 1st you started out with a dividend of
what 31 -2 no she did do that but she had a break the 31 apart big so she said let me look at it in parts so she looked at the 3 using the dividend of 3 the divisor tells you how many are going to be in the group
group no one so she divided the dividend apart because 31 was way too big so by doing that she said all right if i have 3 things and i make a group of 2 i can only make one group
so those 2 have been taken away so that s where she put the 2 in and then she subtracted it and she came back with a one where did she get this one with the 10 do she did it on the 5 times 2 no from where did that one come from what part of the problem
the divisor yeah the dividend she brought it down yes that is boys and girls her new dividend was 11 because she s making it smaller she s taking parts away so in the process of it she has 11
from all right so how many groups if she had 11 things how many groups could she make out of 11 things 2 things in each group she has 11 things picture 11 things in your head
head you want to separate them and you want to put them in groups of 2 make 5 yeah 10 she subtracted it and got a remainder of what
us take the quotient that s right do it
remainder one so +and bring down the one this how many of you are starting to feel a little bit better about this
question i m sorry what what do you mean i don t know would you erase the board for me
this you should have plenty of space left over
okay let s take a look job you did a lot of math all right 2 times 42 times 4 is 82 times 362 times 2
468 now you squiggled out the 2 in the ones place value what was that for it okay and you put a 0 there so why d you put the 0 there so i can move the other 3 numbers over okay so you would remember not to go back to that ones place
is one times 4 is 41 times 3 is excellent then hence 234 then what you needed to do is add 8 +0 is is 10 hence the one regrouping 4 +3 +one is
job do you remember when you guys did this and you were like ugh very nicely done 4 times 2 is 824 hence 4 times 4 is
18 the 02 times 3 is 63 times all right now come on up what part of this problem would be a divisor
the 12 which part of this problem would be your dividend which part would be your quotient 231 have we ever done this before
really eyes up at
now you have to explain it
you were looking a little bored over there so i figured i d give you a job you no pressure ahead 12 divided by 28 is really or 28 divided by 12
28 divided by 12 why did you use 28 and not the 1st place value not the 1st number because 2 is smaller than 12 so then i put a 2 there and it would make it 24 so then i minused it and then i got a 4 but i had to drop it down so i did and then i did 12 times 3 or 36
48 i don t understand how you got 48 it s correct but what could you have done in this step to make this clearer to me present where did you get the 4
says this is just too tedious for me
ahead then i minused it i regrouped i made this into a 10 by taking a 10 from the 4 and then i got the answer of 4 and then i dropped down the 8 and then i knew my multiplication and i timesed 12 times 4 and then it came up 48
yeah any questions what part of this would be the divisor 24 no
divisor 3030 what 34 good dividend nope you guys didn t listen 4122808 this would be the dividend
what is the quotient 4 and 62462 thank you
0 really what s a question you should be asking yourself do you have enough look break it apart do you have enough really really
seeing which would equal what go do you have enough the numbers match
enough do you have enough do you have enough go from there 0 no no no no no do not skip steps
no nope why did you make that a 33 is smaller than 5 why did you cross that out
let s take a look problem you know you need to be good through here what tells you you can be good through that place value 1st of all what place value is it the 1000s okay so it s the 1000s place
you know you re going to be good from here what tells you that how do you know you have enough okay so 1st when you cross that out you have 3000
22 what what s the place value 2000s that s right 2000s now you re going to move over one grouping of 1000 into what called 100s okay so you re not taking away from the 4 what are you doing to it
crossing it out and making it what smaller or larger smaller if you make it smaller you re going to have way not enough bigger that was your reasoning for regrouping from here correct larger so now you re going to make that not 400 you re moving 1000 over
so if you have 1000 +400 because that s what you had was the 400 that what are you going to have now can you write that number up there
it okay good here no so you wanted to go right to the 3 but wait this is what you have in this place value correct
now what do you want to do to make more there okay where are you going to get that 18 from you re going to subtract what from what from here
it so you don t write the zeros so what are you doing from here away okay
adding you have 80 and you re moving it over so what are you going to have here now no i wrote it really badly but yeah go ahead 0 no 80
8 +0 is 8 so what are you going to have over there now it does that make sense as to the progression of each place value
they are filming this they are filming this do not worry about do not worry about it
by now everybody should have today is date the lesson objective written on your paper how to use problem solving to select the correct operation can we still write we will be able to to i put it in a form of a question essential question same thing
see you are finished yes madam can i see please i put the wrong date that is okay just put it over here where is yours
date is that your math journal book book my everything book that is what i thought take the off can you see
way can you see i already copied it okay like that yes you 2 go ahead and go back there change your cards i was getting my pencil i am asking you about the lesson objective yes do not do that please
seat okay this should be a review you for you as far as choosing a correct operation i need for you to open up your books to page 242
okay you should have it by now and this is a daily thing with you it still waiting on your table members let me see the 1st table with everybody at their table with their thumbs up
i am still checking i am still looking looks like is going to win as soon as that other person gets their 0 it was princeton
point i said everybody who found the page put your thumb up 1st now when we talk about operations what do i mean by operations
multiplication multiplication multiplication give me another example division division give me another one
subtraction subtraction and one more did not i call on somebody from your table 0 and i called on nobody from this table from right here eenie meenie miney
addition addition so those are all the operations which is one of the possibilities that we could use in order to figure out a word problem usually this seat is empty but i will use this one anyway let us look at the word problem that they have for us to solve on page 242
letter a read that for me how many students are taking animation at the art school okay how are we going to find that out c the calendar on the right the calendar on the right
so we are going to use the picture on the right which is kinda like a chart that gives us information classes read problems a through d below and use the table about the operation and mister regis notes to help you solve the problems so in order to help us solve question a we are going to use the table at the right
state what does the 1st table state they state how many kids on monday tuesday monday through saturday is in the animation club okay she stated that it talks about how many kids are in the club where it says art school signup that is where it tells you what it is about the bold print at the top of it what does the next chart tell us about
animation drawings group drawings right so it gives us a group and they have jerry maria greg tran tran tran it looks like a m and those are the different groups and then we have our drawings and it has 501 810 642 756
so letter a we said how many students are taking animation classes at the art school which chart are we looking at is going to be the top one that says art school signup or is it going to be the bottom one that says animation drawings j the point to the chart that i am talking about huh that is not the chart
this chart no d animation drawings animation drawings why am i going to use the animation drawings
it says how many students are taking animation classes at the art school okay well that last one says groups and it says drawings does that tell me how many students d you are going to use the 2nd one what does the 2nd one say
the 2nd says i mean tuesday what does it say at the top of the 2nd 10 on the 2nd one it says art school signup right that is the one i thought you meant but you said the 2nd one that is actually the 1st one okay so art school signup and it says how many students are taking animation classes at art school what are we going to do in order to figure that out
you are going to you divide you are going to divide we are going to add it hand okay hand what am i adding these 2 what am i adding students but what
107 you just add up all those and that is your answer okay
so says we have to add all those and that is our answer 123 on thursday 78 107 so does everybody see where got those numbers
yes okay now how am i going to add this up t you can go like through all the ones then all the 10s then all the 100s okay
value i am going to do all the ones then i am going to do all the 10s and then the 100s and if there is regrouping and if there is regrouping thank you 16 +7 23
23 you leave the 2 and put the you put why so we have 23
20 +0 223 is now we got 2 +one is . 34 +14 so that is count how many 403
answer 403 k for tuesday class there are 25 pieces of drawing paper for each student how many pieces of paper are there in all
huh put your hand down which operation i want to know which operation are we going to use and i want to know the phrases telling you which operation what is telling you it is going to be that operation how much how how many
no not how many say the operation 1st and then tell me what gave you the idea the phrase
h multiplication because when it says how many sheets of paper are there in all we have to times 25 times the number of kids there 403
t i think it is addition cause it says in all okay i would agree with her i agree i agree with her i agree i did not ask but okay see it says for tuesday is class there are 25 sheets of drawing paper for each student how many sheets of paper are there in all now it does have in all and usually when we have in all that means to add
but there is another phrase in there that tells me what to do j multiplication because it says for each for each now but still she is not wrong m mixed up cause that phrase right there can be used with anything no
what yeah multiplication is just a shorter way to add up all the numbers especially if the numbers all the same all we have to do we cause we know how to multiply we would multiply
but if we did not know how to multiply you could add up all the numbers and still get the same answer it takes you a little bit longer but it is not wrong okay that is why i love math cause there is more than one way to do anything
25 oka i am working with 123 times 25 25 now this should be a review it should tomorrow we are taking math benchmark yay so you need to and it is going to cover everything that we have covered so far from august to now
desk i see doing other things besides paying attention now that i have your attention what are we going to do 1st
a multiply the 5 and the 3 okay we are going to multiply the 5 and the 3 in the ones place 15 so i have my 5 here and carry the one and then carry the one
c you are going to multiply it 2 times 2 and the i am going to multiply what 2 times 210s place 2 times 2 and then the one no i do not multiply 2 times 2 c you are going to do 5 times 2 i am going to do 5 times 2 cause see right now i have not multiplied all these numbers yet
i have not multiplied all these numbers yet these 2 so therefore i can not move on to the digit that is in the 10s place 11 missus from the homework i say delete that what am i going to do next what am i going to do next
you are going to multiply 5 times 1156 plus the 166 okay what do i need to do next 10 times 2 no that is not where i am going to do next not me that is not
right i am going to put my 0 here to keep my place so that i know everything shifts q 3 times 23 times 2 we are going to do 2 times 3 class what is 2 times 36 i forgot to cross these out let me know i am not using them anymore
d you are going to we just did 2 times 3 we are not working the 5 anymore what am i going to do next
dear would you like some help
choose someone turn around 2 times 2 okay we are going to go 2 times 2 so therefore your chair needs to be turned around and you need to be paying attention
2 times 2 is what class 4 easy it is 4 i do not want to hear easy and then when i get your paper i am like what happened was he not in class what is the next step
no no i am not ready i just did we already worked at everything for 56 then we said 2 times 2 is 4 left what is the only thing that is left one i can not hear you baby can you speak up just a little bit
what is the next thing she is multiplying 2 times what 012 times 12 times one is what k you put the plus in the plus what do we call it
addition sign addition sign now i am ready to add 7 wait until i say the numbers and then you say the answer
6100 and 2 +133 so that would be your answer so they needed 3075 75 what sheets paper sheets sheets
sheets cause if you look back at question b it says for tuesday is class there are 25 sheets of drawing paper paper for each student 3075 let us look at c c read that for us
how many more drawings did maria is group make than jerry is group and i know what operation okay what operation subtraction because it says how many more okay it says how many more what 2 numbers are we subtracting and tell me what chart am i going to get that information from
r you are going to get it from the animation drawings group drawings exactly and i am looking at jerry and maria so what are the number we are going to subtract 501 and who has 501
okay shh why do you say it and what is the next 810 810 what is that maria is yes okay and we all said that we are going to what subtract that is what operation we are using okay since we are subtracting what do i need to do 1st
the 8 -0 am i able to do 8 -0 no huh make 01 am i able to do that do that is what i am asking you cross out the 0 and okay i need to regroup so therefore i am going to over to the one cross out the one put a 0 there and then bring a 10 back
now one -10 is what 90 -005 -83 that was you that was not me
309 it was not jerry though 0 yeah maria has 9 wait a minute i think has a sentence for me so let me hear what has to say mary is group has 309 more than jerry is group 309 what drawings 0 thank you more the last one that we have letter d
yay for every 2nd of animation 12 drawings are needed how long will tran is animation last over so if so how many whoa this one has more than one step
so let us look at the 1st sentence for every 2nd of animation 12 drawings are needed that is a lot so that was information that we are going to use in a moment the 2nd sentence says how long will tran is animation last well how many drawings does tran have
756 okay and then do you want me to say the operation yes go ahead and then we have to divide because it said how many how long will tran is animation last it says will there be any drawings left over so you know it is division so you got to divide 756 divided by 12
okay she says we are going to divide she explained the entire thing which is pretty good so we are going to take 756 right 12 this is how many drawings tran has divided by 12 do what are we going to do 1st you are going to see how many times 12 goes into 75
i know no that is not the 1st step step what do we have to see 1st before we get to 75 7 yeah we try to figure out how many times 12 can go into 7 7 which is in the 100s place
no equals 0 so i usually like to put a 0 here just to keep my place j j did give us the answer so if we were paying attention we should be able to answer that
next we already said 12 is not able to go into 7 so what do we have to do next
if it can not go into 7 what is the next thing we do number let us see if we can help her out
how many groups of 12 can go into 75 66 times 2 12 you 6 times 16 +one
77 so put that 6 above the 5 and then 6 times 12 is . 6 12 times 6 subtract 32 subtracted from 5 is . 30 and then 700 so what do we next
6 so we put our arrow bring down the 6 next and i usually like to write this down next and put your hands on top of your desk
sit up and pay attention c see how many times 12 can go into 36 d 3 times says 3 so go ahead and try it out 3 times 12 is what 36 go ahead and put 36 here
we go ahead and subtract and it is 0 63 no remainder there is no remainder 63 animations thank you that is what i am looking for 63 we need 0 animations we need for every 2nd of animation there are 12 drawings and 12 drawings are needed
last how long will tran is animation last 63 a minute and 3 a minute and 3 seconds a minute and 3 seconds that was good 63 seconds which is . one minute and 3 seconds one minute and 3 seconds one minute and 3 seconds okay are we done with that question d
no yes how many say yes raise your hand i do not like like okay how many say no that is weird cause you have not written okay why are not we finished with question d
well why do not we say it again if so how many you skipped a question sorry will there be any drawings left over okay will there be any drawings left over
over there is no remainder cause the remainder is 0 very good and it says if so how many so do we have to answer that one okay now this is what we are going to do am i going to go 1st eh eh see you tomorrow ooh candy thank you give each one of you a stick thank you
you are welcome sounds like candy no well hold on a minute pop it
yes what is that i am getting a color i like the way is sitting there so nice and patiently and so is princeton is sitting there we were almost there right i was about to say princeton was sitting here so nicely and then somebody ruined it i already got 10 see how much did you have fun at the baby shower yesterday no
okay raise your hand if you did not receive a pencil raise your hand if you did not receive a pencil raise your hand if you did not receive one okay look at the pencil and look at your number on the pencil do you see your number on the pencil okay if you look at the problems on page 243 whatever your number is on your pencil that is the problem you are going to do
yay yeah 010 man so if you have number one you are going to do problem one 2 if you have number 3 you are going to do problem 3 4 if you have number 5 you are going to problem 5 and if you have number 6 you are going to do problem 6
and i want you to do it right under your lesson objective and you have about 5 minutes to complete that problem
so you need to go ahead and work on your problem miss w and i will be walking around and you have got 5 minutes to do it since everybody has a different problem i should not hear you talking
problem sit in this chair the correct way on 3 this goes with 3 too year if each roll of film had 24 pictures how many rolls of film did she use one what operation would you use to solve the problem
are you going to use multiplication division addition subtraction which one to solve this problem okay which one are you doing 66 okay you i am a little confused because i do not know which owner okay well read what they have 1st mister
marcel marcel spent 10 minutes talking to each booth owner in 2007 that is the part that i do not understand okay that is just giving you some information okay he spent 10 minutes
one how many minutes did mister marcel spend talking to the booth owners okay so if mister marcel spent 10 minutes talking to each booth owner in 2007 how many minutes did mister marcel spend talking to the booth owners well these are the booth owners here
so i am supposed to do all of them crafts pottery stitchery jewelry paintings and they said he spent 10 minutes in 2007 so if okay it says he spent 10 minutes talking to each booth owner
how many minutes did marcel spend talking to the booth owners there 5 so okay so how do we find out
see you have about 2 more minutes we are done give us 10 minutes i can tell that is ready cause she sitting there quietly waiting which is a good way to show me you did not put all the words so what did you do
pencils down pencils down pencils down okay this is what you are going to do to compare your answers if you had to do number one i want you to take your composition notebook and your book with you and i want you to meet back there underneath the discipline chart
everybody who had number one you are going to meet back there with okay everybody that had number 2 you are going to meet over there on the sofa area
missus everybody that had number 2 take your things and meet in the circle area do everybody that had number 3 i want you to meet at this table here no meet at is table out can i take everybody that had number 3 meet at is table
if you had number 4 meet at this table
table and if you had number 5 meet at this table no number 5 here on the floor and then number 6 you are going to meet at this table everybody with number 6 you are meeting at this table number 6 who is on number 6 am i the only one raise your hand if you have number 6
here okay raise your hand if you are number one so all the ones are over there
raise your hand if you are number 2 all the 2s are there me number 3 so is the only in number 30 me too okay 3 people you need to move down you should be across from them number 3 and how about number 4 okay and number 5 that is everybody here right
okay what you are going to do 1st of all you need to listen what you are going to do is compare your answers see if you all have the same answers ones if it is be able to explain why you have a different answer and how you came about that answer
so if you need to make changes you could do it at that time what did you get i did not do i did not do it
add i added 2 i added all this in the blue 0 yeah and then okay why did you do blue 2007 okay well look let us say over here on the side it is telling us what the scale is and it is number of booths and then if i look at number 6 it says mister
marcel spent 10 minutes talking to each booth owner in 2007 so if this number of booths so if i look at the blue it tells me i had 32 booths for crafts right 32 how many did i have for pottery 16 how many are you going to have stitchery 12
28 what about paintings 24 okay now what do you think i am going to do 22 so i have 22 here 3 +245 that is 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
why why why not cause it says how many minutes did mister
spend talking to the booth owners 0 we did not write okay so the minutes right the minutes
right clap once if you can hear my voice loud i should not here other groups all the way over here hear now so what am i going to do
write the i think write the minutes 0 yeah over here next to the nope we are going to this is the total number of booths how many booths that is the total number of booths why division does division make it bigger or does it make it smaller smaller it makes it smaller so am i looking for something to make smaller or am i looking for something to make bigger
smaller you say smaller you say . i say smaller you say smaller what would you say i do not know just tell me what you think i think bigger you think bigger what do you think smaller what would you think smaller she is correct bigger 0 she guessed well she is telling me what she thinks okay
mister marcel spent 10 minutes talking to each booth members each means one booth member but this is how many do multiply multiply multiplied by what times 10 student 112 by 10 so 0 times 20 times 2 is 0 is 00 times 10 times one is 0 times 10 and then this one
2 i am going fast i know for those that are finished instead of playing around let us figure out what the others would have gotten for okay so so you need to write that down no it is 1120 what c yeah okay go ahead and write it down no
we got it okay if you are already done go ahead and return to your seats if you are already done go ahead and return to your seats if you are already finished go ahead and return to your seats
quiet quiet quiet keep it
one okay read problem one out loud please eric took 5 rolls of film with him on vacation he can take 24 pictures with each roll of film how many pictures can he take okay somebody from group one what was the answer
do i mean multiplication operation says each and that i just know that and the what is the answer answer is 120
is pictures correct 120 pictures and that was correct
correct yes okay number 3 read the problem for us
mary took 96 pictures last year each roll of film had 24 supposed to be that should be here pictures how many rolls of film did she use read the rest of it for number 3 baby
what operation did you use to solve this problem okay who else was in the group with her
it you would have to divide because it says mary took 96 pictures it says how many can go into it how many if it had 24 pictures how many can go in each roll stop that that means you divide 96 you do division and you divide 96 by 24 so it is b
thank you that is correct how about number 54 i mean number 4 i was about to jump to number 5 read number 4 for us how many rolls of film did she use okay it what was the answer 4 and how did you get the what operation did you use division you used division
correct and number 3 it is number 3 goes into number 4 yeah exactly they all had to do with the same problem 5 who did number 5 you can you read number 5 for me babe you are supposed to be following along here is your pen okay what operation did you use for that
use addition okay she said you use addition d 72 visitors 72 72 visitors yeah that is correct number 6 who do we have in number 6 read number 6 for us mister march marcel will spend 10 minutes talking to each booth owner in 2007
follow along how many minutes did mister marcel spend talking to the booth owners follow along and i know it okay now you notice number 6 is the multiple step question so that meant that they had to do more than one step k you are supposed to add what do we add
what numbers are those understand the numbers from the chart okay it is the numbers from the chart 2007 i meant 7 yeah in 2007 so they had to look at the chart where it says types of art they had crafts and they had told you how many booths for each section so the 1st booth i mean the 1st one for crafts that was how many
one that was 32 booths and then we had to go to the next one which was how many 16 and then the one for stitchery 24 are you following along 24 so they took all those numbers and did what
add and what was the answer that you got from that 1100 you added all the booths and that is what you got 112 what was the next operation that you needed to do
we times multiplied multiplied 112 times 10 and that gives us 1012 you have it on your paper right yes so you say i was just going to say it 1000 and what is this what place is it in
10 i mean it is in the 100s place 100s so what is it 11 wait 1000 if it is in the 120 1120 okay so i need for you to check at your table to see if everybody has their answers down and it is correct
today boys and girls we are going to continue on and extend a little bit of what we ve been working on the last couple of days
who can tell me what we ve been working on algebra a little more specific j input output table yes yes for
can i use variables yes is that something we ve been working on yes what is a variable a symbol a symbol what can that symbol be
shapes what else is it one symbol that represents a number a symbol that represents an unknown number what else letters letters so a variable is a symbol it could be x it could be y it could be a it could be any letter of the alphabet some of you said i could use symbols i can use a square that s my little star
triangle these could be put as our input and our output as well we could also write a what about
expression and equation okay what s the difference between these 2
an expression does not have an equal sign and an equation has to have an equal sign does not have and i ll just put that d in does not have an equal sign k a mathematical sentence a mathematical sentence
who can give me an example of an expression an expression has just give me an example x .7 that point meaning what times and you used the point why
because it would look funny or you may not understand x with the x x x 7 so that point or that dot or that represents what expression okay and example of an equation
can you help her out y x plus y equals what y
what about x +5 equals 10 yes yes what are the unknowns in this 1st one x +5 equals y y that s correct and this x +5 equals 10 there s only 11 unknown that s correct
so today i want to discuss just a little bit more expressions with variables because we worked on expressions and variables in our input output table output so i want you know that you can do either or and sometimes you may see it one way the next time another way
output the next time you may see a variable in there do so you may see it like this you may see it that you could possibly see it like that so those all 3 mean the same thing
good so let s just kind of i m going to go over a couple things with you because i also want to go talking about expressions with variables and then i m going to pull a small group to that back and work with you specifically then time permitting i m going to pull another group
but basically you can write a variable to represent the price of anything number i m going to read you an example and then we re going to come back and talk about writing and expression listen carly bought a snow dome in each state that she visited on vacation
she visited michigan indiana and ohio how many states did you hear there fingers 3 each snow dome cost the same amount in all 3 states
what expression can you write to find the amount she spent well you can use a variable to represent the price of each snow cone because or snow dome because does it tell us the price
it what did your group say x +9 x +9 x +9 let s see what did your group get we did triangle times 3 equals x
triangle times 3 equals are we writing an expression or an equation expression so do we need that equal no so we ve got 2 expressions here
x +9 and x times 3 which let s talk about these 31st of all it says they have 3 snow domes and the price of each snow dome is unknown right
so is that your triangle so the price per snow dome
correct because there are only 3 domes because there are only 3 cones so that one that was very good thinking and i could see where you might come up with that 9 because 3 cones times 3 possibly
but this would be the correct expression and the triangle represents or stands for the price of each snow dome because that s the unknown know suppose carly paid $4 for each snow dome to find the value of the expression what would we do
make triangle equal 4 make triangle equal 4 so what would my new number sentence be or my new expression be $4 times $34 thank you for putting that dollar sign there equals $12 so that would be correct
so you could say that carly spent $12 for 3 snow domes
so that is expressions how would you write an expression that shows 5 shelves with the same number of books on each shelf
s triangle times 5 triangle times 5 could i put y times 5 matter that is the variable raise your hand if you think this is correct
to write an expression that shows 5 shelves with the same number of books on each shelf what does this triangle represent books that on the shelf on the shelf
correct and sometimes they may say if for instance on this one i said if triangle equals 5 what would i do
you basically just plug this in and 5 times 5 equals 25 so that would be 25 books in the whole shelf or not on the whole shelf but on the 5 shelves thank you
so if i let s work a couple of examples and these are actually just putting expressions in word problems
so if i said 4 times square and then i said if square equals 7 you may see something like that
do 4 times square if square equals 7 why would it be 28 because 4 times 7 is 28 28 so basically you re just taking that number and plugging it in and 4 times 7 equals 28
m square equals 7 and that s fine that s fine okay what i want to do i m going to hand out white boards
okay raise your hand if you need to borrow a marker
those guys i ask that when we are doing this we not write anything extra on there so when ms h is checking i can look right at your answer
now 5 times triangle if triangle equals 7 that is yes find the value of the expression
so 5 times triangle if triangle equals 7
understands you can just write the answer and i m going to come around and pass some wipes out
socks this table board up table very good
table excellent 54 now i m going to see if i m going to challenge you
54 divided by star if star equals 6 let me say it one more time 54 divided by star if star equals 6
54 divided by star if star equals 6 up you got it
table this table
this now i am going to switch gears and change it up a little bit now you re going to write an expression that matches the words
so before i just gave you an expression and now we re going to put words with it which is called can anybody tell me when you put words in there what is it called problem problem solving it actually makes it real something that could possibly be in real life right
words 7 times a number of pages triangle in an album 7 times a number of pages triangle in an album so what would you put there
triangle that s all you do 1st basically so all you would put 7 times triangle
next 4 times the number of magnets square on a refrigerator this table you all got it
table excellent this table it last one
36 keys divided by a number of key chains star 36 keys divided by a number of key chains star
moment give everybody an opportunity to finish it
up it should be 36 divided by star table excellent this table sentence and it would actually be switched
star but write it as a number sentence no you can just leave your white boards on your desk
i do need my markers back and we are going to go ahead and go into our centers lesson let me go ahead though and that way if we have extra time but i will prompt you because i do want you to work in centers if you finish in time i am going to assign homework
i will be assigning homework from your practice book but i ll put that on the board in a few minutes so let me have and to the back table and i m going to work with you and others you know where to go
here boys you ll need a pencil and paper
can i just work on the maze
the input output table as well as expressions with variables let s do expressions with variables 1st in so you just follow along with me as i go over that
m it is number you can use the variable to represent what you don t know in an expression or what was the word i used
un un known unknown so i m going to just read this to you and we re going to talk about it and then we re going to actually go down and do a couple of examples words barry has 12 foam balls to share with his friends
how many balls will each friend get if there are 4 friends how many balls will each friend get write an expression that matches the words so if barry has 12 foam balls to share with his friends that s kind of backwards
so 12 divided by star 1st if star represents the number of friends what they re going to give you another example without plugging in the number number so if barry has 12 foam balls to share with his friends it would be 12 divided by star
the star represents the number of friends so this is find the value of the expression if star equals 4 and 12 so now you plug in that 4 for star 12 divided by 4 equals 3 so each friend will get 3 balls
4 they are giving you expressions that match the word you a number of tennis balls triangle divided among 8 players
i want each of you to think about that and what would be the write your expression
one a number of tennis balls triangle divided among 8 players what do you have
remember now i m seeing that each of you put 8 divided by triangle
triangle this is the 2nd that is a separate problem so read number one you are correct
number but listen to my wording and let s talk about it and see if you wrote it correctly or not
m divided by 8 that is correct a number of tennis balls triangle divided among 8 players so that would be i said triangle 1st divided among what i want you to do i m going to we haven t gotten there yet
now let s turn that over and so actually i want you to listen to my words and then write down what you hear me say how many balls will each player get if triangle equals 16 if triangle equals 16 how many balls will each player get
down how many balls will each player get if triangle equals 16 this group over here each one of you all should be writing down your own answering individually you can confer with each other but i m going to be checking for each person
listen to my wording i didn t say triangle divided by 16 i said how many balls will each player get if triangle equals 16 do what do you plug in if i said how many balls will each player get if triangle equals 16
this is just what you guys were doing a little while ago do 0 it s like the one we did yesterday write it out this is what we just did a few minutes ago when you just came in
how many balls will each player get if triangle equals 16 correct
go 16 divided by 8 equals what 2 what use your thinking and don t look on somebody else s paper thinking that theirs is right and yours is wrong answer 2 is the correct answer 2 balls
balls now we re going to come down and i m going to i don t want you to look at these i m going to read it to you and you write down what you hear me say 4 chairs at each of some tables
4 chairs at each of some tables square wording 4 chairs at each of some tables square by i didn t say divided by
i said 4 chairs at each of some tables square no 4 chairs at each of some tables square
square is the unknown so what is the number sentence you re going to write you were just writing the number sentence you re writing the expression
square 4 chairs at some tables square what is the unknown there how many tables there are
that think about it you and i said 4 chairs at each of some tables square
square for times square now so what you re listening for you re just listening for what i m saying and putting that in an expression expression you were just trying to figure out what it is equation that s correct
this how many chairs are there if square equals 6 how many chairs are there if square equals 6 now each of you do it and then we ll talk about it 6 what do you need to do
how many chairs are there if square equals 6 what does the box represent the number of tables the square no 4 chairs
the 4 represents the number of chairs the square is the number of tables so each table an unknown number of tables is going to have 4 chairs at each table expression but then 4 times what
4 times i said 4 times 66 nope 0 yes 4 represents the number of chairs per table right the square represents the number of tables
what we re going to do i want you to write the number sentence and then i want you to come down like i did here and just write what each number represents and what each symbol represents before we solve so let s read one i ve got 2 more to read with you
i m going to see how well you guys can do with this a number of pencils star shared between 6 students
it a number of pencils star shared between 6 students and now tell me what each what does the star stand for
the number of students the unknown number 6 is a known number so what a number of pencils star shared between 6 students pencils so come down and just write a little arrow by star and tell me what that represents
c the number of pencils pencils and the 6 represents what
go so again the star represents the number of pencils the unknown number of pencils and the 6 represents the number of students
that now we re going to go one step farther how many pencils will each student get if star equals 18 how many pencils will each student get if star equals 186 times 3 is 18
wrote right here how many pencils no you ve got pencils an unknown number of pencils shared between 6 students but you need this is not multiplication and division
division because 18 is the star and if it was multiplication what would the wording be if it was let s look at boys come on why would it be multiplication instead of division
let s look at a couple of the other ones the 1st one said divided among so that keys you that that is division the 2nd 14 chairs at each of some tables okay
that tells you that that s going to be multiplication because you ve got it says 4 chairs at each of some tables it doesn t say multiply but it s telling you that you ve got these chairs and x number of tables so how many chairs are there
but then the other i m just trying to cue you guys in on when you multiply when you divide i want you to listen for your wording a number of pencils shared that word shared between shared between 6 students
division like this was 16 divided by 8 the 1st one
multiplication or division write down what you hear a number of vases square each with 5 flowers a number of vases square each with 5 flowers
with 5 flowers a number of vases square each with 5 flowers write down what the square equals and what the 5 equals a number of vases square each with 5 flowers
vases vases the square equals the number of vases that s correct the square because it says a number of vases square excellent
flowers now how many flowers are there if square equals 80 so it would be 40
40 because 5 times 8 you re thinking correctly but let s kind of back up in how many flowers are there if square equals 8 so what do you plug in to that square 8 vases 8 vases correct times 5 and that equals 40
me i divide when i hear some of these words multiply when i hear
done you can go up and get the problem of the week did you all draw those in your journals
yes excellent girls
read shared among or divided among as well because it may be either or
shared among or divided among
i multiply when i hear not up there if there are too many people over there you may not there may be no more than 5 per station so if you need to go some place else
were you doing the math problem of the week what are you doing the math so you multiply when you hear what
what do you think and when you do that write your number sentence and explain what the number and the variable stand for
it just draw a little arrow like i was doing on the board and tell me what they stand for let s switch gears very quickly and this is what we were doing yesterday this these are different
so what i want you to do is take look over at number 154 is w minus q
so what you want to do w is 9 and q is 6 plug it in and see do 54 minus q so 54 minus q
q 2 so 54 -2 equals what equals a w what 5254 -2 equals 52 you can just come down there and write one and write it straight across
you re plugging in the value and you have to do a couple of different things because they ve given you the q or the w well come on all this
and write your rule
you so no because this one is going to be rule 54 minus q and q is 2 so the w equals and i m marking this one so i ll show you but in the next one they ve given you the w so 50 equals 54 minus q
52 thank you 54 -2 is 52 and one would be so you kind of put the inverse of what was here
excellent they ve given you w equals 52 minus q you have your q and your w so you don t know which is which
w so you re plugging in this is what you re plugging in 54 -2 equals 52 w 50 equals 54 minus q
50 no 54 -44 correct so now your q is right there
numbers 54 minus
me then do the next one w is 54 then but this one they are let s see that s your original formula not your formula but your rule
w 34 equals 54 minus so now they re asking for what the q is so 54 minus what equals 34 show me what to do
there you go
job and you can write it vertically if you want to q is it larger than a q
yes looks like it to me
you re going to plug in your w 50 equals 54 minus q 50 so it s 4 now what do you do
up you re just going to have to look at it and see what do i do here
have you ve got your w so where s that going to go
w this is your original rule this is what you re going back to each time so you re given the w for this one so 34 equals 54
q 0 okay okay boys and girls let s go ahead and clean up our centers do not leave your center until everything is cleaned up
54 divided by q equals subtract it out
q you re going to rewrite minus what who are my kids to check the versatiles if you and would check those
boys and girls for homework i want you to do practice book 6.3 that should be in your math journal we re going to continue this hang onto it
i m not concerned about that so you can stop i want you to finish that one
all right kids you can put your writing away for now everybody knows what they re going to do today
i m going to pass out your practice assessment again put your hand down dear clear everything off your desk because we re going to be switching
put everything off your desk groups i m going to call certain people to the front so we can work on the division i might call a couple of people up after that just to kind of help them as well
the rest of you are going to be doing this practice assessment to see what i need to do what else we need to cover what you do understand and what you don t understand and then we ll go from there when you finish this all the materials that you need for the division game are in the back
directions as well as if you have time you can do the science center with the different types of clouds well i do not have a lot of glue sticks so you re going to have to if you have your own that s fine but you re going to have to share and be cooperative teacher i have the same ones that you had in the beginning of the year good for you
okay so what i would like i would like the back row to be formed in a group too because we re using the back table now helpful let s move the desk back and i will tell you when i want your group to go on the computer as well
today so let s see
the following people i m going to have you come up with and come on up
yet come on up and sit down i have paper for you you need to be listening and you need to be focused on your work
you re not getting out of your seat without permission enough let s have s group sit over there
here whose group are you in what did i tell you
let s go why don t you come up in this group for today
there boys i want it stopped i m not going to tell you again if i do i m calling home lab you can stay here
well computer lab has a phone to yep you can start activities you have your activity sheet that tells you what you have to do
go you don t need to take it those no i want you on the floor so you can write table can we keep these yep you can keep these this will be just a good little resource for you to use
this is another way you re here he doesn t need to be here
okay so let s take a look at the multiplication table
this some of you are still having trouble understanding that in order to divide you have to be able to multiply what should you do dear do should you sit on the floor or should you go around and get another chair
ahead so if i needed to know you had a problem 17 divided by 2 here do you see that right there
i know my multiplication i already have one okay why don t you use the one i gave you because it s bigger and it s easier to read well here s the thing
here actually i found the number 17 right here you re not going to find the number 17 on that
good it s not an even number so if we have to do 17 divided by 2 2 divided by 17 up if we have to do 17 divided by 2 what we can do is we can use our multiplication table to help us our goal is to get as close to 17 without going over
good okay and we know it has to be 16 but how many times can 2 go into 17 without going over 8 so let s talk about one of the division strategies we were doing the other day 2 so i want everybody to put it on their paper
then i want you to do so we re going to practice it 2 ways
okay so we have 17 pencils we re going to break them up into 2 groups because we re going to give the pencils to 2 kids now looking at your multiplication chart how many pencils
what is the maximum number of pencils i can give to each student see let s take a look at our 100s chart let s take a look at our 100s chart chart how many pencils do we have
17 we have 17 pencils 18 how many pencils can i give away total without going over sit how many can each child get
8 i can give 8 to each child
that not this might seem kind of easy but this is how you learn you understand the easy ones and then you can progress from there over so we can say that no
things if we re doing 17 divided by 2 what we re trying to do is figure out how many one person can get so how many can one person get how many can one person get
8 and how many pencils are left over sense so the answer is 8 remainder one
okay go ahead this group over here why don t you go on fast math now no okay let s try it this way now when you see it this way think of it as a multiplication sentence
watch i m good at this way good see this equation right here watch 2 times blank equals 17
2 times blank equals 17 now we know looking at our multiplication chart 2 can t go into 17
here 2 times 8 equals 16 j 16 it and we have 8 remainder one why don t you go in the back
it so our answer here focus is 8 remainder 11 we re going to stick with the smaller what are these we re going to do these but we re not going to pick the super big ones right now
now let s do 15 divided by 6 fine just don t yell out the answer how many boxes am i going to make now
6 6 boxes over here so you could do it either way you ve just got to pick the way that you feel comfortable with and decide what you want to do
now let s take a look at our multiplication let s go back to the multiplication chart tables hold on
out there s my 6 tables right here here s the problem 15 divided by 6 so what question are you going to ask yourself 15 what s closest to 15 without going over what number
how many 6s can go in look 6 times 2 equals 12 finger 6 times 2 equals 12 now let s go back here
now this says 15 but don t let that bug you focus 6 times 2 2 equals 12 12 and we get 3 left over
do i do not know it 6 times 2 equals 12 subtract 15 -12 is 3 good 2 remainder 3
but the thing was when you were doing that the other day you guys were getting so hung up on the division you re not even thinking about it like if it s you know
be now over here if i was going to do it with the picture and the boxes i have 15 pencils do i m just going to give everybody 2 because 15 is a small number i don t need to start with 10 so we have 2 4 6 8 10 12 and i subtract
i m stuck on 2 divided by 17 here why are you still focused on that when we re here right now you should have raised your hand when we were on that problem so why don t you focus on this
if you re still focused on that problem you re not learning m no i will call your group up when i want you to that i did
okay let s do 41 divided by 6
let s do 41 divided by 6 you re going to help me out with this one okay so everybody right now 0 i know this don t yell out the answers you re writing what i m writing teacher v taught me how to do this teacher v is a
she for the day because the former 6th grade teacher is now at west i know she comes after school good let s focus on this okay so let s go back to our multiplication chart and here s my 6s
my goal is to get as close to what 41 41 as i can j let s take a look at our multiples of 6
42 can i go to 42 why let her explain
42 because we re doing 41 divided by 6 patient can i go to the bathroom not right now 6 stop
pencils i want to give them to 6 kids so the closest number to it is 42 answer it might be the closest number but is it the best number not because that s over 41 good how can you give away 42 pencils and you don t have 42 pencils
all you have right now are 41 pencils right 42 is so close to 41 you re like 0 it would make it so much easier but you don t have it and that happens in life sometimes 41 so what number what multiple of 6 can we go to no look at your multiplication chart to help you 36
36 how many 6s equal 36 6 6 times 6 equals 360 i want somebody here to show me how to do this problem
this i want somebody to show me how to do this problem ahead he can do this one 6 times 6 equals good
right now this is what we re focusing on no okay so now you have to do 41 -36 5 very good yep that s a 0 there yep
this let s do it over let s do this here we re going to give everybody 6 now if you didn t have your multiplication chart you might have started off with 5s because 5s are easier to count than 6s and that s okay but if you have your chart you could start off with the other biggest factor that you can
6 and we know that 6 times 6 equals 36 36 and we get 5 left p i have 5 pencils left
kids can i give them each an equal number of pencils the noise volume is a little too loud i m having trouble hearing somebody that s a foot away from me sorry it would have to be no
this let s go back to the question before we were interrupted i asked left hold on finish my question is if we have 5 pencils left can i give them to 6 kids
no so if i can t give an equal number to 6 kids i know that number is my remainder here when this number here is smaller than this number we re done so our answer is 6 remainder 5
5 we re going to do one more problem together and then i m going to have you do a couple on your own okay so let me see 79 divided by 5
so i know that when i see 79 divided by 5 i need to go to what number on my chart table now you re going to find that if you use your chart the highest number is 5 times 12
tables so if we have really big numbers it s not going to help you that much but i can show you some other ways for it to help you so 79 divided by 5
tables i want somebody to come up here and i want you to pick the biggest factor that can go right here the biggest number right here what are we going to put there and what are we going to put inside the fence
up almost
one you should be thinking of what number in case she needs a hand
table here s your 5s table right there yep i can do this with no problem okay but we re not going to yell out the answer and we re going to be respectful so just be patient
9 -0 dear go ahead very good right so what we did right away now let s take a look at the picture
we decided that we have our 12 table pencils right pencils that s a total of 60 pencils
after we gave everybody 60 pencils we have 19 left we can still give some more pencils can t we i want you to talk with people 1st before you say the answer
loud how many pencils can we still give now i know i can give more i have 5 here and i still have 19 left i can give everybody at least one you tell me look at your multiplication chart chart so you go to your 5 tables
okay we have 19 left there is going to be some extra left over you can go on
you ve been pretty quiet what do you think buddy i ve been writing stuff down quiet how many more can we give to the 5 kids how many more pencils one
okay let s give them one more he said one more here i m going to give them one each okay here and i know that 5 times one equals 5
14 how many more pencils so i ve got to subtract here 2 14 can i still give them more pencils yes no so if we thought about it could i have given them more than one
it then you know if you got one right then you can get the other one right so i m going to do 5 times 2 equals 10 left so we re done so we re done why are we done
because we have the answer how do you know we have the answer answer 4 remainder 4 4 i want a hand
4 we have to add up the numbers in the box and we have remainder 4 time can we go clockwise let s go back to 19
now the good thing about doing it either of these ways is if it takes you 3 steps it takes you 3 steps steps now let s go back let s go back to 19
this is where i ve to use my multiplication chart to help me 19 there is a 20 but 20 is too big
up now watch when i use i think using the finger helps helps 5 times 3 equals 15 15 now if i went back in time and i was doing it this way now watch go i m going to do the circle again
5 times 3 equals 15 4 so instead of doing it in 3 steps we did it in 2 steps but still if you get stuck and you want to do one that s fine it s whatever you feel comfortable with
all right so 15 remainder 4 this is what i want you to do i would like you and you can talk to each other without arguing if you get stuck i would like you to try the last row on your papers
try at least 3 problems the very last row 3 81 divided by 3 and 61 divided by 7
what we worked for 30 almost 40 minutes it you can work with people talk to each other yes you can
what are we having a problem with here
days it would be 45 times 17 let s just try to simplify this 15 laps for 7 days so what i would have done here is i would have done 7 times 15 7 then she swam 30 laps each day for 10 days
that would be 300 laps 300 laps 30 times 10 answer okay you don t multiply it down okay
we re good how are we doing buddy all right why don t you go on that i corrected it there you go
you were close don t think about now if you were like 0 i could combine them this is what you do now that you know your answer you can test your theory to see if you are right 45 yeah okay then 10 multiplied by what
17 let s see so it s 105 and at least he gave it a shot
you have to multiply you have to figure out this part then you need to figure out the 2nd and then add them together 30 times 10 is 100 really does that make sense that if 15 times 7 is 105 that 30 times 10 is 100
on go on
you guys too will go on next okay 8 times 80 640
pencils say you had 6 pencils 6 80 remainder 6 very good because watch 8 times 80 is 640 left 8 times 0 is 0 8 you can t do 6 minus okay
you know what you re doing math right now after all that work i want to see that you can do at least one boys sit up
now do your work don t blame her for what you re not doing any questions over here
no i m actually all done i thought you said you were all done 0 no
what did you put down right here one what s 9 +9
one +one 22 +one
it that s fine are you still working on number one chart do you have good for you
okay to start our class today remember that we re going to work on our time
s that means time from one place to another okay a period of time from one place to another so give me an example of something we use elapsed time with in the day in our day what is something we have done today that actually would have used elapsed time our reading stations our reading stations were elapsed time
j when we went to when we went to we ooh we did we overlapped our time so our reading i mean our science time didn t get to be as long because we went to team time which overlapped our normal time okay remember just lay it over there wouldn t it be any time we did today
anything we did today that went from here to here would be elapsed time am i right when we have all those things on the board that show you where we re going even though the times aren t on them are those all elapsed times time so i believe our pattern was one hour and 10 minutes every time
it so let s go ahead and we are actually on the 5th even though i know this is the 10th we are 5 days behind which is okay if you will tell me what the time is on the 5th and if you are way too far away you can definitely come to the floor you don t need to worry about it as long as we re nice and quiet
so on the 5th tell me what time it is and i will go ahead and put 1512 and give me the time 4 40 4 40 and is that a m or p m looks . a m a m and also remember this clock is really happening okay
happening what is going on with that b the sun s light daylight is starting to appear isn t it this is what dawn for most of you who had never been up at that time looks like it s actually it depends on the time of year though because you know from science when that s going to happen a m is that did it hold true to our pattern okay and this is our number corner
and how much elapsed time has gone by since january 1st 4 hours and 4 hours and 40 minutes so are we still seeing a pattern here yes okay go ahead and move your eyes to day 6 january 6th which was last friday who can tell me what time it was on january 6th
a 5 say it again 5 5 10 now the only reason i m questioning you is because if i put 5 10 down which i can do that except i ve got she s going to change it want this gets a little tricky doesn t it what do you think
5 50 yes ma am sure you can check it bag okay so it s 5 50 now can anybody tell me and this includes you because i think i know why you said what you did that why do you think that she got a 10 in here somewhere
reason because the minute hand was on the 10 the hand it is and sometimes people would call this sometimes people would not call this 5 50 5 10 how many minutes is it until 6
it one hour and 10 minutes yes yes please 55 hours 50 minutes let s look at saturday when you were all busy at home calendar a little bit of a change maybe
me say it again that s okay you can give me an answer let me hold it out here so you make sure you see it because i m not sure everybody can see it
changed 7 okay s because the pattern is adding an hour and 10 minutes and there was 10 minutes until it was 6 0 and then i added an hour very good
so it was 7 0 and it s still in the a m we noticed the background of the card was much different because by 7 0 in the morning many of you are probably not out of bed on saturday am if you are out of bed you notice that the sky is definitely light okay
time what is our elapsed time 7 it s 7 hours isn t it this we ve got 1234577 well we didn t we didn t really skip 6 did we no i mean we really did have 6 0 it just turned into a right
minutes yes yes but the way the pattern fell we might every once in awhile see a little jiggle in here like this right so 0 minutes maybe every time like it picks up to 5 hours okay so you re going to give me a prediction that maybe every 5 hours we re going to see a blip on the radar
might on sunday when you might have been getting up to go to church maybe you were sleeping in what time is it on sunday sunday
8 20 huh it added 1020 it took away that s one hour and 20200 i think i okay so between yesterday between saturday and sunday what was the elapsed time
11 hour 20 minutes 0 maybe you add 20 minutes maybe so maybe every time we see a little blip we re going to put a little arrow here because that s our little blip line and we re going to see what happens
elapsed since the beginning since here how much time has elapsed on 30 okay monday when you all had to come back to school
yesterday yesterday tell me please what time was it yesterday let me look at it sorry i can t i m so sorry but i don t have any of your attention at all you re way too far away to see what we re doing so you need to join us up here please
m 9 40 a m notice we ve got sunshine but a few clouds there one 9 12 he said it was 9 40 a m did it add one hour and 20 yeah between there and there yes
class 9 hours and 49 hours it was on the way to i m seeing patterns all over the place looping that s what i want you to start looking for now are some looping patterns
today 10 0 11 0 so we have 11 is it still a m
p m 120 clock 12 one right time what happened between 9 40 ooh between 9 40 and 11 0 hour 1010 10 40
what s 10 40 +20 minutes what would 10 60 be 10 60 would be 11 0 held one hour 20 we have how much elapsed time 9 hours got to have you awake
no it s 11 hours it s 11 hours m now guys look at this look we had that there and we had that there
what is happening that is different between this huh it skipped and this it skipped 2 hours it skipps a number why it skipped one because if you add another 20 they made it how it would add an hour and then you would have to add another hour to it okay i ve got all kinds of conversations going on
about i m not going to tell you the answer because when it did this last time they changed the pattern over here and i m not going to tell you what tomorrow s is look yeah when it was 7 hours with 0 minutes they changed the pattern
minutes now we have 11 with 0 minutes so what do you predict what do you predict tomorrow s time is going to be tomorrow one hour 30 minutes for okay
12 30 what if they keep with this tomorrow okay now we re going to switch gears because our number corner is through for today and i want to work with you on decimals and fractions so those of you that are seated are going to go back to your seats and i m going to start talking to you about your decimals and fractions
day i have a question when we like when i wake up in the morning it s dark at 7 0 but when i wake up on the weekends it s at 7 0 it s light that shouldn t be happening okay okay on your desk you have a paddle board
units if you need more of anything all you need to do is raise your hand and i ll get it to you but the 1st thing i would like to see you the 1st thing i would like to know is what do you remember from yesterday s decimal and fraction what s something we did yesterday that you remember from yesterday not yesterday 0 yesterday what do you remember from yesterday we did exemplar so we can t remember from yesterday
came and she got a money she did and we did a between tenths and hundredths okay
cart and so had 10 and i think i had 400s i had you were the i had 4 hundredths 4 hundredths and i think teacher h had 440 hundredths 40 hundredths or 4 tenths 4 tenths so what money did someone put on teacher h s 00
please 4 dimes because she had dimes and i have 4 hundredths and in money hundredths are ones pennies pennies okay can the 2 be combined
boards so the 1st thing we re going to do is i would like you to build for me on your manipulatives i would like you to create 7 tenths please 7 tenths then i would like you write it on your paddleboard in decimal form and i would like you to write it your paddleboard as a fraction
so you can split your board in 2 and i d like you to do a fraction and a decimal 7 tenths please i m just going to walk around and see what your 7 tenths looks like if you would build them you need to build them on something though otherwise you can t prove to me that you ve got anything so if they re not if they re not on something you re not really showing me what they re ooh what s that line mean
of if you re not putting them on top of something you re not showing me the out of part seeing and then i need to see on your paddleboard would you please write it as a decimal and write it as a fraction please write it as a decimal and write it as a fraction and we re doing 7 tenths everybody s doing the same thing right now okay
you ve got to write it as a fraction also okay good done good 0 you need to keep place value please good yours are so close together that it s hard to know what you re doing
excellent this is what i saw and this is a really really good job
s this can be a guess because it s not the 7 would have to be up to the one so you are so on the right track keep going so to get 10 you would put a one for the 0 kind of
g if it didn t have the 0 then the one under the 7 would be a whole number not if there was a decimal there it wouldn t be
a because ones place and 0 if you did you re supposed to put the 0 because there s a ones okay ones if i gave you 2 flats might you need to use this place
yes because i might need you to write i m not going to do it because you don t have enough but you could write actually you could probably do this put if i ask you to do one and 7 tenths on your desk what would you show me one.7 okay but what would you show me with your manipulative 0 what would you lay out in front of you if i wanted one and 7 tenths
maybe you could put out not a maybe do 110th i need to see it on your desk desk what am i looking at though it but i want to see who has one and 7 tenths i need i need your help
it one and 7 tenths what if i d ask you to do one and 7 tenths where s yours i don t know what i m looking at at show me where it is anything where s yours 11 and 7 tenths or 7 tenths i m seeing 2 things where s yours right here okay leave it
now you tell me i did tell you to leave it i m going to do something and i m going to need to say right here pretty much table this is a 10 rod with 7 on it . and this is a decimal point
okay and i am going to put another one up there so hopefully not spill it one and this is 7 tenths that i was pretty sure would happen to me right there
though so now i have told both of these people to keep theres it s right there thank you i told both people to keep theirs and yet these do not look a like to me
okay there s your decimal so this is really good board i believe somebody told me what they would look like and they were right
i thought it was would it look like this also yes okay so how s which one is correct both both they are not both correct 0 they re not both correct so now you re going to figure out which one s correct but you re going to have to defend your answer
so is this one and 7 tenths or is this one and 7 tenths i can see both sides but you need to defend your answer to me please okay what do you think the pencil one or the expo marker one because i need to be able to hear you because i can t hear you
waves because 7 tenths so you can figure out 110th this is a whole which one of these is going to represent one whole w h 0 l e a whole g the pencil one the pencil one
why why do you think this represents one whole and this doesn t i think it represents the i think it represents the one whole because okay this is a whole guys 100 so this is not worth one
correct one and 7 tenths okay know okay i m going to change my i m going to change my problem for you board i would like to see 25 hundredths demonstrated as a manipulative
fraction so you will show it to me in blue you will be put it on your paddleboard 25 hundredths i don t care which section you do 1st you can do the manipulative 1st 1st 525 hundredths and you re not supposed to be telling other people and that s actually not okay
if your if your items your little unit cubes are not smooshed together in a nice straight line they re not going to be okay h because if you just have it it s hard to count it count if it s together where it belongs how easy is it to count
easy it s like less than a 2nd okay okay you ve got yours up together it can t be like that please okay now my challenge you did not have it as a fraction
good fraction and a decimal what was that 0 i thought was 2500s you don t have it as a decimal okay okay now do not erase anything good do now i would like you to tell me don t move anything off of your board
i would like you to figure out what is not covered do not move anything off of your board i need you to figure out what is not covered don t move it
okay leave what s on there and on your paddle board write down as fraction and as a decimal what is not built on on you got to be looking at your own not at hers you you need to recount
fraction and a decimal and if you have all these numbers on the same you need to re count i think okay okay now i actually have a couple of answers alone i want to show you 2 things and you guys are going to again talk to me about what s right or wrong
i saw this and i saw this now you want to talk to me about what you figured out had this and she said she figured it out so tell me what you figured out please
you i looked at what i made from like from my from my and i counted the bottom and i had my 5 at the top so i accidentally counted that as 0 okay and it s only worth 5 okay so you agree then i got 70 and i added the 5 that went there okay
b 75 okay how do we read that correctly though remember we don t call it 0.7575 hundredths very good me this is correct but i want you to tell me how you would know that this can t be correct
wow how do you know this cannot work because some people might have been mistaken they weren t paying attention true
s because you have 25 and you took the 5 off the 20 but it would be 75 because becomes a whole they could have made a mistake with their counting whole tenths okay what were you going to say
that since you have 25 the 5 wouldn t make a whole empty space so you d have to count it as how many so it s okay there s a whole other reason here guys i need a tiny little more thinking going on there s a reason this cannot work not only is it wrong it actually can t work but there s a really good reason behind it
this is like having a dbq on your desk this is like a document based question write singly on your desk work and you need to think a little bit outside of that box today okay
think because 10 rods 10 times 10 is a 110 rods fill up this we put 25 on . on . on the 100 unit because we put 25 take a way 210s from the 100 and then 10 -2 is 0 i know i know 10 -2 is what
boy did your explanation help a lot of people figure something out didn t it say because 25 +85 equals a 125 +85 does not equal a 100 does 25 by 75 equal a 100 yes and if you have part shaded and part un shaded what do the 2 have to eventually equal
100 a 100 okay yes what i did i subtracted a 100 by 25 and i got 75 okay but let s use are different math language what a 100 no you didn t subtract a 100 because that s how many you subtracted what does she need to say
she she subtracted 2525 from from 100 clear your board please paddle i would like to see on your board i would like you to build for me please 42 hundredths what 42 hundredths 42 hundredths 4242 hundredths i need to see it on your board
i need to see it on your paddleboard as a decimal and i need to see it as a fraction 42 hundredths your okay your board is wrong 0
okay okay good okay it s pretty simple isn t it job we are ready to move on because we re way good with this this excellent okay now i m going to ask you 5 i m going to give you 4 different numbers and for those of you with 5 i m going to have to give you another extra number okay
so if you re in a group of 4 which there are 3 groups of you that are in a group of 4 which reminds me of the exemplar yesterday exactly with the triangles and the rectangles 3 times 4 the person i m going to give a person s name and i m going to tell you what to do all of you are going to build something different now so you don t need to worry about your paddleboard right now at all don t worry about your paddle board
97 hundredths for and 3 tenths 3 tenths i need 14 hundredths 14 hundredths and i would like you to do and are going to do the same thing and i m going to have you do 57 hundredths 5 i m not i don t know what i told you so you needed to listen to me
57 hundredths desk i don t see yours anywhere so okay so what did you build 3 hundredths you should and what did you build
okay i got and what did you build it okay i don t want anything on your boards right now okay okay now put you lid your paddleboards i didn t want anything on so the paddleboards are down
lids are on your expo marker and please listen to my complete set of directions before you go on you are now going to figure out by looking at your entire group s manipulatives so it may take some standing up and looking around a little bit
empty you re going to put your decimals in order from least to greatest by looking at them looking at people s manipulatives so it might take you 2 or 3 minutes to figure this out but you really need to know where the people s stuff is because you do have a lot of manipulatives on your desk so make sure you know what you re looking at
e can we do these on the board no it has to be at the manipulative you re going to write it you re not listening to my directions at all because that s not what we re doing this time go least to greatest let me tell you right now about something you got to watch out for greatest we do it all the time that when a greatest to least comes along on a test we do you guys often miss it
so you really need to make sure you re reading directions or put this just means put them in order
absolutely okay i m going to give you approximately 2 minutes to figure out everybody in the group is figuring it out but no mouths are going at all there s clamp your mouth shut number no
know say it again no not at all sweetie what s your number e you need to build 3 tenths for this group because otherwise they can t do it you re building 3 tenths where s yours okay so you guys are putting them in order from least to greatest okay
space okay i like the fact that we have no talking you need to put them so that i can actually read them in order least to greatest okay some of you 2 groups will have 5 numbers and 3 groups will only have 4 numbers
what am i looking at
at when you write them in least to greatest they need to be horizontally
up that s well it stops right here because it does do that yes okay yeah you re going to have to
well okay okay i have a question there s 23s and i was just wondering since they re the same do i just put after the 333 and that s a good thing for us to talk about okay how are we doing
it a lot of we re going to put it on the board and see what we what we think and why we think we re right yes you could actually do it because when it s in different places it would be the sun would be like you mean you could do it like a protractor it could be like in here or horizontal well actually you re right this well not really because no i was thinking about like a way we could all remember all the different things 0
good because then like it would be here for horizontal and then down not a bad idea are we good order do not erase anything even if you don t agree with what i put on the board don t erase your numbers
manipulatives everyone s looking at your paddleboard all of you have the same numbers except for 2 groups and they added another number so but you guys can help us with that so what did you feel as though in your group was the least decimal space covered just 0 thank you for reading it to me correctly so 3 tenths tell me how to write that as a fraction
p 3 over 10 right and even though we would never read it like that when you re telling me how to write it there s really no other way to do that what do you think the next number is m 14 hundredths i m going to need to do something here sorry
and 14 hundredths how would i write that in a fraction can i hear you please 14 hundredths how do i do that though put the 14 as the i can t hear you you put the 14 as the numerator 0 okay 14 in the numerator
this okay the next number the next number j yeah 3 tenths 3 tenths we ve already used 3 tenths 0 again are there 23 tenths anywhere no
that so i m going to do this because i m not sure i don t know who s right sure let s put it up and then i ll put something under it here 33 hundredths that s can you tell me how to write that
yeah decimal okay okay i probably need to hear from the group of 5 me okay then i will put yours down here 5 they agree with me so far so we ll do this
wait we don t agree with the 0.3 i ll put both of them okay you disagree with yourself next 57 hundredths 57 hundredths tell me how i would write that 0.50 okay not everybody has that so that s why i m doing 2 different things
know okay so i m 0 what do i put over here for this 132 okay and there must be something that s last m 097 hundredths and how would i write that 0.97 okay and group of 5 you agree no you don t want a 0.97 at the end
8 it would be 0 point what okay i don t think i gave that number but i ll let you have it okay no problem no problem okay this now we have a little discrepancy but i m going to let talk a little bit because he disagrees with himself now so i m going to let him explain what he thinks what do you want me to do
i think you should erase the 0 before the 3 what do we call that 3 tenths 3 tenths i should erase it from here or there
gone because is greater 0 i love the way he s thinking brain i need some of you guys thinking about ghost zeros while i m standing up here
i think we need to do some ghost 0 thinking some of you got an answer right on your big 20 because you specifically said to me i remembered my ghost zeros and it made you get the answer correct so you want to talk or you want to i m still thinking he s still thinking
okay so where should i put a ghost 0 to see if we re right ahead 979 it wasn t 97 it was 97 hundredths 0 no you should put a ghost 0 no
you don t think we re right remember our question is are these things in order from least to greatest so we can test this by doing ghost 0 s are you going to talk to me about ghost zeros okay tell me what to do you add a ghost 0 to the 3 hundredths is there a 3 hundredths up here
the hundredths if i add a ghost 0 to 3 tenths yes okay i ll add a ghost 0 here that is a horrible it looks like a hot dog it does because i didn t leave myself much room can i add a ghost 0 do i need to add a ghost 0 anywhere else no okay so now in your mind i don t have your attention at all
oops i forgot something over here guys we re going to do the long one for over here now is this the thing about these numbers in order look there you re telling me that if from least to greatest 301433 ooh i got people going like this
5787 ooh why are you shaking your heads because when you put a 0 on the 10 s it makes it hundredths so it s supposed to go after the boy say that again nice and loud fabulous i ve got several people not listening and i always know when you re not listening because your lid is off and you re busy with your hands so i know that you re not listening
loud if you put a ghost 0 on 3 tenths it makes it 30 hundredths and it should go if it s from least to greatest it should go after 14 hundredths so this should go there huh so yeah so let s check it
know now if you think about just take the decimals out of your brain for just a 2nd 1430335787 yes does that work
it how did you do it since i knew 33 tenths equals ¢30 0 and like 14 hundredths is only equals 14 pennies good guys if you re doing decimals take it to money and it will help you so much now let s look over here
i want to show you something that s really cool i m going to fix this but this is going to look funny and i want to show you why i am teaching you with both decimals and fractions at the same time now i want you to look at that and if i gave you a paper like that many of you would go 0 because all of a sudden it s wrong
weird 14 hundredths 3 tenths but look zeros 30 but what if i have to do if i put a ghost 0 up there you have to put a ghost i have to put a ghost 0 there and there you go see how easy it is to get them in order so we ll never miss any more on your big 20 or never miss anymore on your homework now so now we ve got a box on homework and a box on big 20 that s easy
easy okay yes teacher t yesterday you told us you wanted to teach us about singapore math i do but i probably won t do it today but i will try i will get a little tiny bit of singapore math in okay okay let s do let s clear everything and do one more of these okay okay and you are going to create the problems so you know what
i don t have a problem at all well it will be easier if we all work on them together care decimal or a fraction 48 tenths how would i write 48 tenths
okay i need good listeners need good listeners tenths he would like me to do 48 tenths so i need to i don t know how to write that
that why does that have us stumped not like if it was a subtraction problem you can t take 48 away from yeah but we re not doing subtraction is this a and you can t divide it s not that s not 48 there aren t 48 you can t get 48 on here can you
done can t be doing so can you very good excellent thank you and i knew i had stumped you but 48 hundredths this is 48 hundredths okay give me another number please and this one i would like in tenths please m tenths say it again 3 tenths ah we did 3 tenths so we can t do that one again
please do 7 give me another number please
care quickly 9 tenths give me another number please and it has to be hundredths and i m going to give you one more number
5 if you have only 4 people you choose the 4 you want to work with thing you choose you guys choose what number you want
minutes i need your attention thank you go 30 tenths 0 all 4 of you have a different number yes she has 948 do all 4 of you have a different number
yeah okay do all 4 of you have a different number yet does everybody here have a different number yes okay
it you don t have anything though you need to know what number you re doing all 5 of you have to have a different number so you need to find out what everybody else has j do we have to order them what did i tell you to order them as 0 yes you do need to order them greatest to least what s your number greatest to least what is it
i don t really even need to do this what number do you where is it i don t even do that it s easy what are you doing but you don t have guys you don t everybody done here yet so you really shouldn t be writing anything because he doesn t have anything done so i want you to be comparing them by looking at them you guys can even set them in order if you want to from greatest to least okay i mean physically move them to set them in order
you may physically move these you guys listen you may move these actually in order on your table if you want to and show them to me greatest to least what they physically look like okay i guess am i supposed to write this on my no you re supposed to fix it on your board
number 616 what 16 hundredths okay you guys can actually mover your boards on this table and show them to me greatest to least in a row okay these you guys can move them i m not going to look at it
you can move it for me if you d like to on your table and you guys can put these in a row from greatest to least do physically physically put them on the table in a row you that s not what we re doing it where s your where s your where but there s no order
d okay one of the things that you did not listen to and this is in closing what we re going to be doing i want to see on your tables a row of manipulatives that show me what it looks like greatest to least not on the paddleboard i don t want to see anything on the paddleboards ooh i want to see it on your desk
appreciation to those who have nothing on their desk except their math folders boy and girls your math folders are supposed to be on your desks because we re getting ready to review what we did this past week yes no not at this time
all right can you please have a seat i m checking to see if everybody has what they need on their desks
all right 1st we want to review our types of lines s parallel parallel lines drawn right across
right excuse me one set of lines that go on and on that never touch and these are parallel lines what s another set of lines e intersecting lines
x they cross each other they cross each other angle correct yes okay and as we know about intersecting when we re walking in the hallways we always say stop at the intersections right so all the intersection hallways are the halls that are crossing
we have to stop or else we can run into another classroom 0 excuse me my bad you i was thinking perpendicular but thank you
perfect okay now we can get to those what lines perpendicular perpendicular teacher i need an eraser okay just one moment
you you never know if i m just messing up just so i can see if you guys are keeping up with me see if you re paying attention know all right these are our types of lines
around so push your chair in because we re going to do some movement with these lines to help us remember these lines because when we take our quiz we re not going to have our notes but if we just make some gestures to help us remember these types of lines we ll be okay
so when we see parallel lines we re just going to do our arms like this parallel because they go on and on and they never touch you parallel lines now when we see intersecting lines we re going to cross them
cross we re crossing them perpendicular they form a right angle cause if you look in here right there there s your right angle
angle now as we do this i may call out a set of lines it perpendicular
parallel perpendicular perpendicular i see some people doing this here perpendicular parallel intersecting
parallel perpendicular remember remember remember all right good job thank you
lines next we need to review types of angles
okay our types of angles we have what we call what would we call this angle acute acute why would we call this an acute angle
t it has less than a 90 degree angle it s less than 90 degrees because we know 90 degrees would be right here right yes and that s inside of our 90 degree mark right
angle and another way to remember acute remember when we said 0 a baby is so cute you know babies are small right so if it s smaller than a 90 degree we think something is cute when it s small right
acute all right our next angle what do we call that angle obtuse obtuse and we know an obtuse angle is what to a 90 degree angle
multiple students more than more it s outside of the 90 degree mark right and when we think of obtuse we say obtuse that just sounds gigantic doesn t it it yeah when we think of monsters do we think of the tiny little monsters no
scary so since he s bigger wider than 90 degrees we think of obtuse a big hairy monster
okay then what we have our right right angle our right angle what 90 degrees 90 degrees so let s fill in
an acute angle is less than 90 degrees obtuse is greater than 90 degrees and a right angle is exactly 90 degrees all right
okay now we have another section that we need to review
now we re going to get into the types of triangles and the angles they have
all right looking at that triangle we learned something about that triangle didn t we
teacher s but there are 3 triangles and i get them all confused looking at those measurements for that triangle who can tell me what type of triangle that is n isosceles isosceles how did he know that
what clue helped him know that that s an isosceles triangle j 2 sides are the same and one is not 2 sides are the same and one is not
okay it has the 1st 2 letters is is and there s 2 letters and there s 2 numbers okay let s explain that good job
the word isosceles with the word is is so on this triangle how many sides need to be the same 22 that s how we remember isosceles is that a good way to remember it
yes how many of you think it helped you while you were studying with your parents because you had 2 others to remember way i know you may confuse that scalene and the isosceles right so this helped you
good our next one what kind of triangle is that one
d equilateral equilateral why is this an equilateral all sides are the same all sides are the same they re all the same think of the word equilateral is there a clue in there to help us remember that triangle
all the sides are equal all right we know that l it has the word equal it has the word equal in it
triangle so now there s only one left and what do we call him scalene scalene because we can say this is 4 2 and 3
none of the sides are the same n it can also be a what a right triangle yes we can make it that when we re ready to get to the angles
yes my dad he was confused about obtuse like a right angle okay and that should be on this page i ll make that extended out some so it can look like one okay
our isosceles triangle looking at that angle and if we draw our line to make a right angle what kind of angle is this isosceles triangle
m acute it s an acute triangle an acute angle
one if we draw a right angle what kind of angle is this one angle it s inside
e acute an acute as well
scalene what kind of angle would that scalene be k obtuse obtuse let s look at this everyone she said obtuse anyone want to debate and be able to explain why
why right if it was an obtuse it would be greater than 90 degrees it would be greater than the right angle but this falls on the same line doesn t it so it s a right angle
scalene this could be 6 5 and i call this 2
looking at this one what kind of angle would this be
obtuse it s more than 90 degrees it s more than 90 degrees okay excuse me
you so if it s a right angle it lines up perfectly with the 90 degrees it makes that perfect l l okay yes you re stretching okay all right now that was our review
now we re going to review some of our measuring angles using a protractor
i want you to take out the sheet that we started on monday
yes in our study guide okay
later can you put this in your desk
let me turn the elmo around for a moment patient all right can you guys see
differently all right that s an extra pencil thank you ma am now we started doing these tuesday when we 1st got this sheet we were just looking at it like 0 my goodness
what do i do with it and i explained to you that we know what a right angle is and the degree of a right angle correct yes we know that a right angle is 90 degrees however to get the measurement of our acute and our obtuse angle we use this little tool called a protractor
and what we did was we learned how to use our protractors when you have an angle what was the 1st thing i told you to do if you have something like this what should you do 1st
me yes put our protractor down and let s go ahead and extend those lines because when it s time to use our protractor it will be extended in order to reach the number that we re trying to obtain
does everyone have their lines extended yes now remember when we re using our protractor to measure we take this circle and we line it up with the corner
does everybody see it that s where the little hole is and my line is lined up right here
now do we need some help right now looking at our protractor can you guys see from up here let s see if i have enough light shining on this
yes okay this would be our 90 degree right angle wouldn t it right here
yes is this line greater than or less than a 90 degree angle angle obtuse all right now we need to find the exact measurement protractor it s 10 and then the increment the halfway mark is 5 right
35 now on the outside right here you have 70
then you have 65 60 excuse me 170 165 160
160 then you go to 155 and then down to 150 here now looking at our angle would that fall under 115 or would it fall under 65 degrees 65
is this angle 65 degrees or 115 degrees 115 115 degrees does anyone object 116 mine falls on 115 so i m very close to 115 because remember we said we re going to the nearest degree
it s okay if yours doesn t fall exactly on that because when you measured your line you were probably one little line off but you re close to it now if you said teacher s i think it s 110 then we need to re measure our line extend our line out
65 no one said 65 90 more than 90 degrees so we can write that down as our amount
this is 115 degrees now let s get our protractor and put down for the next one remember put it down close to the endpoint of that angle
wrong have i done something wrong already v you didn t extend your line i didn t extend my line
if i don t extend my line it s going to be very hard to see where that line falls
right you need to be working this out
all right now looking at my protractor at my angle this would be a 90 degree angle right yes but my angle is right here
so what type of angle is this one angle because it s less than 90 it s less than 90 degrees now that we have this we know that it s acute
looking at our protractor is this going to be 150 degrees or is this going to be 30 degrees
why do you need some more thinking time z because it s less than 90 degrees because it s less than 90 degrees and we know 150 is more than 90 degrees right yes so 30 is less than 90
okay good job
do extend the lines okay
40 you got what i got 40 off because you re having to create yours right because you lost yours right but you re close to it mean see if you re at a 40 do you bring your angle wider or do you close it in some
now i m going to show you how to create these angles how to create these angles using your protractor starting from nothing and getting a 60 degree angle yes we re going to start down here
we re going to save these for later because we ve done many examples on how to measure angles that are given to us but we re going to have to learn how to draw angles with the given degree raised i know how to draw them okay good start so just look follow along see if i m doing what i need to do okay
right this is nothing to get worked up over cause sometimes you guys look at something like 0 no i can t do it but what eventually happens it just pay attention to me and we re going to get this they want us to draw a 65 degree angle so what i want you to do is 1st put your protractor down
you see where the circle is right on your protractor right in here there where my dot is i would just put it down and make a dot right there inside that little hole there got it
it see i put my protractor down and i just put a little dot in that hole right there it now take your protractor and we re going to form a base of our angle
matter so i want to go to the left so what i m going to do is put my protractor the straight edge down and i m just going to draw a line extended out
base remember draw it extended out no you should draw it on one side and instead we were going to the what
left now this is the tricky part point we have our line extended out now we have to look at our protractor and find 65 degrees on this side
protractor right here between 70 and 60 right 65 right got it
so i would hold my protractor down and find my 65 on my protractor
me i would go run down to the 65 and i would make a mark right there
mark make a line right there where 65 would run okay or you could make it above it where 65 is however you want to think up or down
now what you do is you take your protractor put that circle on that point edge and then extend your line down
now you re going to have to come over a little bit where your point was and extend that line out
to now when you put your protractor down on that point you should now line up to be 65 65 i will come around and help you
now if you re not exactly on 65 what you could do is start these steps over notice how i m erasing because sometimes we re not going to get it on the 1st try put your protractor down with that line up here it s 65
put your protractor on that and then you turn it around and then you measure it again you may not get it on the 1st try but that s okay math you may not get it on the 1st try but what do you keep doing
trying you re going to put your agenda on my back table because you re not focused and that s not what we re doing protractor you need to be focused here where are you okay now raise your hand if you got it on the 1st try
raise your hand if you have to go back reassess what you ve done it if you did not get it this is the time to raise your hand and say teacher s you know how i do it i don t understand it where is that protractor let s start with your 1st point
here this is 65 right yes there s your point right yes you must move your protractor to where this line is going to meet this point
it then you have your point right there lining up lining up now you see how this line is still lined up right here and your point is right there in the circle and you see 65 right there okay i got 60 point this is your 65 right
take your protractor turn it this way line it up with your and the 65 that yes 0 you re trying to see how to create some triangles out of that cool all right 1st of all you need to draw your base
point this is 65 right point line the straight edge up with your and that line that you made else okay
let s measure yours because yours looks like it s ready all right point you have it lined up right now line your straight edge up with your and your line now measure it
it okay anyone else else all right was that hard do find our point on the protractor find our point right do you have your point
do that s the only thing we ve done so far do draw a bottom line right using our straight edge
so we line our straight edge and we can go to the right on this one okay and extend it out that who does not have that
up and now let s find 38 right yeah then we count the smaller marks
8 so what i m going to do is put a mark over that 38 done do you see the mark right here 38 i made me mark right over the 38 mark i had it lined up with my and i put my mark right over the 38
381st of all let s think 38 is that acute or obtuse acute acute so we know that s going to be what more than 90 degrees or less than 90
less than 90 degrees less than 90 degrees so when we look at the angle is it going to be like this obtuse or is it going to be like this it s acute
okay now take your straight edge line it up with your and your mark that you made over the 38 and bring it together
and you know you re going to have to wiggle it and play with it a minute and see if it lines up with 38 degrees go ahead and connect your lines okay if you got 35 do you need to decrease your angle line or increase
decrease decrease there s your point i got 38 now you have 38 now okay this is lined up right here you have your and your line right here
38 now turn your straight edge so that it lines up with that and your line yes it wasn t right unless i did it that way to the 30 right there
see see that would be right here and it goes this way okay yes
okay where s your 38
38 line your straight edge up now measure it 38 35 6 7 8 it s right here
line your point put your straight edge on that line right here help all right what i want you to do with the next one you want a partner someone sitting beside you i want you to create the next angle and i m going to be going around looking to see what you guys are doing
so our next angle is 110 degrees the person sitting beside you together i don t want anyone drawing someone else s for them
yours they are to be working on theirs it looks to me like you re not following directions i just said you ll be drawing yours and he will be drawing his seat now you 2 can work together
why because it s greater than 90 degrees because it s greater than 90 degrees so is it going to look like this or is it going to look like this
okay so did you get 110 110 this is obtuse so this was your 38 degree angle yeah that s more than 90
angle so it has to be inside smaller notice you don t have where s your base line that you drew line line your protractor up with your base line wow
this 1st of all you have this less than 90 degrees this did you have your protractor turned to the wrong side
yes i m confused 0 this is a 90 degree angle notice if your partner says let s look at it this way you re working with a partner
angle so it should be this way let s look at yours wow this is a 90 degree angle right here
obtuse looking good looking good let s see
can i measure yours wow exactly there good job it yes exactly there yes put your protractor down so i can come around and take a look at it it but your partner doesn t have his protractor down on it so i can t see if it s correct
good job okay look this so it has to be lined up exactly with that and this line has to be lined up
it see there you go yours okay you made an acute angle
you made it 70 degrees it has to be 110
point boys and girls i need you to focus up here point so i want this to be obtuse
so i m going to be working with my right side okay so i can make it obtuse 110 i have my line here i forgot to draw my base line point i made my line to 110
now i have to take my straight edge and measure it from here to the and if i put my protractor down and put my arrows because i have been leaving off my arrows and i put my protractor down and i have it at 110
okay we got it right you got it right try how many of you had to switch it around and swing it around a bit and trial and error what i m going to let you and your partner do the next one on your own because that s a what
easy i do not know if it s easy i do not know cause some of you may look at it and say i do not know what that is what degree should we show on this one 90 degrees and what kind of shape does a 90 degree angle make
right angle an l a perfect l i don t want to see anyone just taking a straight edge and drawing an l i want to see you using your protractor to create a 90 degree angle
did i do it backwards it s 90 degrees as long as you measure it it is 90 degrees now boys and girls look up here
when the numbers are on this side and you create over here to make your obtuse angle this is going to be wider top these are going to be your acute right cause sometimes they ll give you an angle and it s on this side and you measure and you re like but my obtuse numbers are on the top do you automatically say it s obtuse
no you put your protector down to measure it because it would fall under the acute number
that all right follow me
watching yeah i see my 90 is right here so i m going to use the inside versus the outside base now i can go left or right
take my straight edge line it up with that line and my and there we go we have our 90 degree angle our 110 degree angle our 38 degree angle and our 65 degree angle got it
now what i m going to have you do is practice a few challenging ones cause you know we learned the easy so you say or once you get to know it you think and when we kick it up a notch
this raise your hand if you do not have a sheet
cab so what i ll look at i ll look at c b so this is the angle we re looking at see measure angle cab
cab c connects to a and a connects to b i know you re saying teacher s a bunch of angles a bunch of lines a bunch of angles they give you the angle they want you to find the degree for 0 now what you do is you take your protractor
no no because it s done for us angle 1st of all is it acute or obtuse acute so is it going to be around in the 130s or is it going to be around in the 50s why it s not next to 90 degrees this angle this is 55 right here right
56 what comes after 136 136 so what degree is this angle going to be
56 so we know that this angle in here is 56 degrees so we say cab is 56 degrees now the next angle they want you to find is dab
so what i m going to do this is my d a b so if you want to erase this because you ve already used it you can
looking at this angle so far is that acute or obtuse obtuse right here is this going to be 66 or is this going to be 114 114 why because it s greater than 90
90 so what we do is draw an arrow and we say this is a 114 degree angle
okay i want you to take a look at the next one eab
this is eab n it would be 172 172 anybody disagree multiple students no
1st of all she noticed it s an obtuse angle and being that it s an obtuse angle it would be more than 90 degrees so there s no way it could be 8 degrees could it no because 8 degrees is acute but being that it s an obtuse angle we know that it s going to be greater than 90 and greater than 90 is what right here
does anybody want to take a stab at it 165 anyone disagree
i mean not 165 156 him yes 56 degrees 56 degrees anybody want to challenge e
64 anybody want to challenge 61 caf
this obtuse i ve heard 56 degrees i ve heard 60 somebody said 60 61 degrees are those obtuse angles 56
so we know this is obtuse 90 so does it have to be a number smaller than 90 or larger than 90 larger larger so what s the larger number 56 or 136 i that s 126
126 yes because this is 130
124 this would be 56 here greater i can t hear you
124 yeah because to get from 130 to 120 you add or subtract if you have 130 and you need to get to 120 do you add or subtract 5 that would be 5 less than 130 124 okay
okay all right my time is up but what i m going to have you do since you do not have a protractor okay so of you don t i m going to let you take this sheet home for homework and finish the rest for homework tonight okay put this in your binder so you can practice some more at home tonight
this particular investigation can you move in a little bit so that we can see you in this particular investigation we are going to be looking at equivalent fractions and info shears our objective this morning we have 3 objectives which i hope we we will be able to achieve by the end of this lesson can you read
use fractions as the operators to find the actual measure of a fraction length of the whole and the 3rd objective understand the need to consider the size of the whole comparing fractions consider the size of the whole comparing fractions
our 1st objective recognize the role of the numerator and the denominator when partitioning what does a denominator mean m how many pieces are in a fraction the denominator means how many pieces are the fraction and what is the role or function of the numerator
how many pieces are being taken away from the fraction how many pieces are taken away from the whole so the numerator tells us the number of pieces that is taken away or that is remaining so who recognizes the role of the numerator and denominator when partitioning what do we mean by partitioning
huh what do we mean by partitioning like breaking apart breaking apart each fractions about breaking apart numbers yes you didn t look like that it is partitioning do we partition when we do when we have fractions do we have partition whole numbers
so like . you said like which means you want to give me an example if that is your whole teach us how you can partition
like if you want a half of a whole you can just can you sit up loud and please go ahead if you partition a whole in half you will have 2 pieces of the whole cut in half please move over can you show is he right yes
what if you were to partition into another fractional part no no using that your half can you see partition it to another fractional part
do which fraction would you do using that i would try to change it to a 4th can you show us yes
how many places has this particular whole be partitioned into
please fourths into fourths okay so we recognize the role of the numerator and the denominator so in this case what is the denominator piece how much is this compared to this 3 fourths this one
fourths 14th and this one would be what 3 fourths speak up 3 fourths 3 fourths so if i take one away from the 4 i have 3 fourths remaining and if i take 3 fourths away from the 4 i will have what
okay we use fractions as operators to find the actual measure of a fraction length of a whole how can we find the actual measure of a fraction length of a whole we are going to see that in what we are going to do in class
does whole number always mean the same length no is it possible to have different sizes as whole numbers okay let us see so if i have let us see if i have this is that a whole number yes how about this yes okay
no multiple students yeah they are both wholes if i take this if this is part of this no it is not a whole is no more a whole number is it 110 no
10 how many does a cube 100 1970 so it is 16 hundredths so it is 200 11 thousandths hold on
sorry shoo how many of this how many of this would give me one of these
10 how much is this 100 100 what multiple students cubic units consider this as a whole number right yes on its own one yes also a whole number in its own right yes
what a whole number on its own a whole number on its own and this is also what whole number on its own so this is what fraction of this
110th 110th because how many of this gives me one of this 9 tenths tem of this gives me one gives me one of this and this is what fraction of this 100 100 no 10
110th 110th 110th because 10 of this that will give me what 11 of these and this yes what do you mean tenths
you this is 110th of this okay what is this a whole what is this a whole a half are they the same
no you just said to this this is a half come what is this one whole what is this one whole are the sizes the same okay but they have the same number right yep one whole one whole okay
need that s the top think to understand the need to consider the size of the whole comparing fractions so is one half of this comparable to one half of this right yes and this is one whole es
is half of this shape the same quantity as half of this one
different but if i have them all broken apart that is a whole right yes that becomes what a half that becomes what half can you see me from where you are
so half this is one half of the pink is half of the red right how about this whole this is a whole and this is what half half right yes so is this half and this no
are the 2 halves equal no right so it depends on half of the half to be from the whole that is why they are say it again the half of different wholes are different she said the halves of different wholes so the sizes are different when we are thinking about the size of the whole amount
then the fractional parts are going to be different but they are going to have the same name 14th 13rd one half 3 fourths but the question is it is 3 fourths of what right yes if we looked at this quickly before we go to our different groups to do our work
me
which one is the right answer 2 and 3 fourths say that again 2 and 3 fourths can you show me how
okay the sign is not here
multiple students he is right there keep going
problem i do not see your notebook in your hand where you solved it need help okay give me needs some help can you sit down please what is it that is doing
he is taking one half away from 14th when he does that what will be his answer -14th -14th can he still solve okay you want to solve this problem for us
go i took the one half and then converted that to 2 fourths and then i did since i know that 5 minus so we said the question you already changed that so rewrite your question in that space if you want
2 fourths -14th equals 14th and then the 5 minus the 2 equals 3 and then i did 3 -14th equals 2 and 3 fourths now something that did that is kind of confusing to me
you said you said 2 fourths you changed your one half you wanted it to have the same denominators right sit down
that is what i did so you said 2 fourths which is your one half here -14th can somebody tell me what did that is out of the way we usually do she switched the problems is there a reason why you switched the problems
is there a reason why you switched the problems so that it would be easier to answer the problem but i didn t say you write you got 14th who is part is 14th on this side or on this side side is from here
here yes and then the 2 fourths is from the 2 and one half and i converted the one half to 2 fourths so it could have the same denominator as 14th walk me through this
you did was you did 5 -2 and got 3 yes and then you said 2 fourths -14th and got what 14th and got 14th then i did 3 -14th you did 3 -14th yes so what is where the -14th from
it was right there at the bottom 2 fourths -14th 2 fourths -14th equals 14th so i took the 2nd 14th and then 3 minus that one should she have done it that way way what do you think no taking away this she took this away from this
did one half -14th but we are doing 514th -21 half problem what would you do different instead of doing 2 fourths take away 14th followed by tell me what you would do here
i would have done 5 and 14th take away half you would have done what 5 and 14th 514th take away half so you would take away this half 1st alone okay so would you change your 14th to 2 fourths you said take away half would you write it like that yes okay tell me what is your answer right here
this so you said 14th +14th right no 14th came from because the 4th from the other can you come do that for me please 514th -21 half
1st i would solve us somebody is solving the problem here
why is everybody not doing anything you ve already solved it yeah i have solved it
this half is the 14th and the 14th i asked you earlier did you take this 14th and kept it like somewhere safe right yeah and then after or so that is what you did here
4th so but what did you do with this half i converted it into 2 fourths and then split them in 2 i do not see it here on if you converted it it would be looking like this aside if you converted it like you say you did it would have looked like this
514th -22 fourths am i right yeah okay but it is not the same because you concentrated on taking away the 4th from the 5th
am i right yes but you were supposed to take this away from this okay e is his answer right yes how about the process this just says something what did you just say
how is able to do that is this one complicated not really yeah to him it is complicated why why do you say that because i can see what he is doing he has 14th +14th equals one half if you like circled the middle thing what is in that middle that equals 2 and one half so he basically just minused that this no plus the 2 plus the 2 okay plus this one
equals 14th of one half he is just breaking the numbers down to make it easier for him
him he broke the 2 and one half down because it is easier to -14th by 14th instead of 14th by one half did you break the numbers down no you did not
did he broke the half into fourths he broke the half into 14th where did he do that right there right here yes and like this one
so here is 14th +14th so he takes this and take away the 1st 14th right now you have 5 whole number right yeah then you do what he take that remaining 14th does that make sense to you
down does it make sense to you much better knowing he broke them down yes to show that okay so the 1st one is this is gone the 2nd one is gone right then we have 33 fourths then he dealt with the 2nd one yes it is kinda clear to me now that you know
to make it easier for what i would do is convert it into percentage to make it easier for is convert it into percentage you convert it into percentage yes to make the process much easier i just take out the 14th from 51 fourths so then just do 5 -2 and one half then when i go so you would have done
you would have saved this 14th and said 5 -21 half and your answer would be what 2 and one half 21 half and the 14th to the 21 half then you take 21 half you take away 14th from it no you add 14th you add 14th to it yes and your answer becomes what
2 and 3 fourths 23 fourths does this work for people yes you have another strategy you would have used what i just turned them into improper fractions you turned them into improper fractions be 5 and 14th would be 21
what 4 huh then 2 and one half would be 5 over 2 but then i converted yeah converted it to 10 fourths so now you are doing 21 so this would be 10 over what is that what that would be 10 over 4
4 she is talking so then that would be 21 over 4 -10 over 4 okay does this improper fraction will it work yes okay why do not you subtract finish the math
it turned out to be 11 fourths 11 fourths which is equal to 2 and 3 fourths 23 fourths works yes okay we are going to now we have the other problem class problem
do not in your different groups you are going to go and we are going to solve problems a to e and the story problem here is the licorice is 48 inches long we have a couple of groups of kids going hiking
so the licorice is 48 inches long and difficult to break into pieces sid combat the licorice by cutting partway through then it will be easy to break and share later so each of the options a b c d and e have something to do with this
so we are going to go to our different groups solve the problem show how you will divide the licorice lace candy so that everybody will get equal share remember we are looking for we are looking at equivalencies and equal shares in fractions if we get everything done we will be meeting our goal
go your different groups please everybody must have a black marker
go go to your different groups please where are you going with that group can you go to where you belong and stop walking like you do not know what you need to do
so if you need another chart you start solving while she is writing the question let us go
if your group has 2 questions the here is to solve these move these time wait wait wait she does not have space
this you can help what here here take the other one
time can you guys at least clean up so that you have enough space to do this a you have time for that you are not asking me
math the strategies are yours i want it solved you solve it you are teaching us with that excuse me
up can you move
you are sanding wasting time wasting time use your marker right away
tracing so we should be doing the 1st one the 1st question you can be solving if she is still writing another question you guys solve did what are you looking for marker i have a marker pen
one this is the 1st one
lines you guys have pens this is licorice okay okay okay okay you guys have a plan
space that says what does that say 18th that says what does that say 18th 18th 23 so you are just doing it like that clear this that is what you did you i know you guys solve just hold on 12nd b one
down sit down start solving is there anybody that did not have the marker why do not you solve the math 1st then you do your drawing and know what you need to do with that
you are not just going to be using lines like that just say you got anything anyhow the fraction will be grab a chair and sit down here use your drawing for question c
are there any mugs that could be leveled with more than one fraction examples yes because on 4 it is why do not you what is your representation no but that is for c to draw that well i want you to also you need to show what you did
number line one
whoa whoa wait 48th it is still one half i am just writing the so it should be on what is it by this side this is a number line right yes okay so if this 48th is the same thing as 2 fourths it is taking a different space yes should you have marked your number lines this definitely wouldn t be a 48 would it
yeah because it is more than one half so we asked you this for 8 b go say that again just cross it out
it does not matter what are we doing over here
next you ve probably guessed what happens next what is your question i should do remark this what is the question here okay right right well you probably guess what happens next
2 more join the hike what does he make the licorice less
can you speak up so that others will hear you and contribute to what you are doing and saying are you sure that is your 12 inches no we just cut it to make 24 inches because we could make the other one how much is each part that is what he wants to understand 0 each part is 12 inches because this is really 24
so what we used what we used this and we made each part 6 inches the question is do you understand how each is 12 inches no like i wanted to like what is its total what is the total that would be inches what is the total 48 inches
done they divided it into 12 inches so how else can you can you guys give me a mathematical expression what about this thing is here 48 divided by 4 and then or
4 i do not know but i want you you to get see he is asking you a question he goes 0 because something i just what is exactly your question are you sure it is really 48
we do not have time for that write right away
focus do not just sit here and you do not get to finish
what are you cleaning no because i am going to write on this one i do not want the easel unsticking whatever i am going to write was this planned before yesterday doing that this does not need to be drawn this is a group work
b 2 we have b one and b 2 and b what is doing he is writing the questions and which one are you answering b one right now see what time you have finished we finished wait use your drawing for c
give some examples so you can can you do this differently and write 2 over 8 will you guys do it 0 that way i like doing it that way can you please do it
you guys should keep going are there other ways you could have done this you tried to show equivalencies that is what you are asking so if you no more equivalencies no no let him finish
so what are you guys how many pieces did you guy cut your licorice 20 fourths how many did you lie in here the hikers yeah the hikers many the hikers so why did you cut them into 24
because he was stuck with the former breaks he already made because he already made 14th breaks and then he is stuck with them and then he has in the problem before this one he had to break it again into twelfths but he is stuck with them for this problem again so we have to break them into 20 fourths 5 more minutes
so everybody can get the same share okay each gets 3 eighths of licorice okay 320 fourths okay and what is the equivalent of this 320 fourths you can continue and give us an equivalent
give me that paper
her why did you take it from her i thought you would do something else that can you guys finish solving what you are solving have 2 why do not i take one right now so where you going with that over here
e i want to know i did that one and then i think it was one of those okay but did you guys talk through it yes so you needed to cut this into how many parts parts and how many people are in this particular group 2 so why are you cutting into 3 parts then
no because that is carlita is and she is giving brianna a piece it didn t say that brianna was getting another okay no so let us go then draw the picture what are you doing with this when you are not working with it
it okay can you guys contribute so that she will know what she is doing i need a ruler i have 2 groups who are done come on it will be nice if you guys will stop this your turn my turn and keep going so that you can be done
my turn your turn has made you haven t gone anywhere none of your questions are answered none all that groups are done and there are 4 of you here me that is all you can do to solve this i do not think so
think about more ways you could have used to explain this you have here that needs to hear the explanation you do not move from your group look at that question ask yourself what else can i say to make my math more meaningful more understandable 48 divided by 4
here what is the relationship between 12 and 48 besides 48 divided by 4 go 12 is 14th of 48 going i want to see everything and he needs to understand what is going on here
finished huh see right there and there 0 on top top and let me get a tape
once you are done put your paper on the easel
yes when is math over excuse me
over why because we have to do spelling today excuse me
can you guys answer this question right here right now i thought we were which one are you doing here you guys said you have 2 questions where is question one answer you guys are the 2nd people that are going what is question one answer we are about to answer it wow so you they told us to draw a thing but now we are going to draw it
i want you to write some next questions that will help us understand what you are doing because looking at that i do not understand what is going on there this has to do one on here there is a little look at this can you please tell me this and this and meaning of
going which one are you 2 you are number 3 and this group have number 4
know 12 times 4 i am trying to get to an answer to put your stuff up
we are going to tap it in here done sit down if you are done get to the rug
teacher as far as this it is a 2 by can you sit down please which number are you guys
hand everybody needs to be in the rug now
now now now is everybody should be on the rug now
go we are not going to wait for you please time you decided to be playing let us go whatever you have we will hear it
okay i am going to continue a who is doing the presentation who is doing the presentation let us go a go from the back
it go from there well let me move this a little bit that way please can you move over here
a the question a was there are 4 people going on the hike how should sid mark the licorice lace so that each person can make a fair share can have share fair share draw a picture making the drawing at least 4 inches long and label one hiker is share of the licorice lace
so what we did to try to solve that problem is we made a drawing of the licorice lace and the we cut it into fourths and then marked one hiker is share and each hiker is share would be 12 inches because 48 divided 4 is 12
12 and what is the value of that the fractional value of that 12 there is it there 12 is 14th of 48 going how did you try to prove that to make sure that that is correct we did 48 divided by 12 is 4 and 12 times 4 equals 48
okay move move move move is there any 48 divided 48 over one divided by 14th is 12 over 0 okay
you does this question make sense to you after everything they did in your group so are you sure that each of them would get a 4th of the 48 inch licorice and that 14th is how much
how much candy is that 14th in length 12 inches can you speak up
well you probably guessed what happens next 2 more joined the hike poor sid has to remark the licorice lace he has made for 6 people with additional marks
so 24 divided by 8 equals 3 and there was 8 hikers so each hiker got 320 fourths and to prove it we simplified it and divided by 3 over 3 and it was the same as the licorice lace why did you divide by 3 over 3 to simplify it
to simplify 320 fourths is there another way you could have done that without doing that can you pay attention here please
there so how do we this twelfths but yes that 320 fourths would be 640 eighths you just doubled how do we break this down j you break down the 3 to one and break down the 24 to so you are solving
how you solving this to simplify it or reduce it further i was going to do exactly what they did so do the i want you to do something different different you find a number that will divide both the numerator and the denominator in you okay do you see the number right here what number is that 3 so 3 into 3 gives you what
what 18th people did not remember that okay go ahead finish i am already finished
did anybody have a question for them when you look at this i am looking at this now and i see a fourths 2 fourths 3 fourths and 4 fourths and under it he said new them 320 fourths 320 fourths
so this is 320 fourths that is 320 fourths that is 320 fourths 320 fourths 320 fourths and that s why you numbered them here 8 so here is how many 8 what 320 fourths does that make sense
what each of the 8 hikers is getting what 18th 18th or what is the equivalent of 18th 320 fourths 320 fourths thank you d who is d here move over so that the camera will still see what you do
d use the drawing for question c are there any marks that could be labeled with more than one fraction if so give some examples yes
because 14th is also labeled as 2 eighths 2 fourths as 4 eighths and one half 3 fourths as 6 eighths and 4 eighths equals as one over 12 halves and 8 over 8 use the number line to show other equivalencies of these fractions speak a little louder please
what indeed does this remind you of any of our previous units tell me what it is that and his group did here
j it reminds me of when we would we were doing the equivalencies of the fraction when we checked and put them in the different cups and because they were equivalent to one half almost to one half almost to one whole less than one half and more than one whole okay what other people remember from what the 3 groups so far have done
this reminds me of the unit with that portion what portion when you use fractions decimals and percentages any other unit that that some of these activities you did especially with what and them did
m on the cookies and crackers one you have to share them equally with the kids that were going on the field trip okay any other thing that people remember by these activities we have done so far a you are done right yep let us see if we have the next group
alone let us see the next group and also put us where we have been before here here your question please
e it states that carlita bought a 48 inch blueberry lace
whole and she cut them each who is in this group okay so she had one whole and she cut it into why did she cut into 3 pieces basically can you move by the side so that we can see
down to share with herself and brianna and one more person carlita bought 48 inch blueberry lace brianna what fraction of the blueberry did she give to brianna
she only gave 13rd yes how do you know that or you decided that is what she should give her were you told how much she should give to her friend told how much is that 13rd what is 13rd of 48 what did you say
16 so she gave her 16 inches of the 48 left say that again she gave her 16 here you are in this group
please so she has 32 left and she gave 16 16 any question here okay you guys have the 2nd page right yeah yes i have a question about the the 1st person is page let us go let us go
go is the only reason why she cut it in half because she is sharing it with 2 people well if they cut they have the option to do that is saying what if you cut it into half how much would she have given her friend 24 24 and what would be the fractional part of that okay could she have cut it into any other fractional part
example give me an example do not show me me could she have cut it into another fractional part c she could not because it is she could have cut it into what fractional part she couldn t because she could have cut it into what fractional part
into sixths to 6s if she cut this into 6s what would happen here us can you do guys do it over here yeah we did the 16 into 20 you can either do this i am talking to you
okay why do not you move this is do this okay so how much will each of those be
each would be a 6th write it down there okay so question move by the side done said you sleeping no
6s so assuming she cut them into 6s how much will she give to her friend 3 sixths yeah what is the equivalent of that 13rd that she gave in 6s in 6s 13rd is equivalent to what
13rd is equivalent to 16th 2 sixths 12 so 2 sixths is this 26th equal to this amount so this is what you said she should have done so if you did this and gave her just 2 pieces of the 6s did she still give her the 13rd okay so you were saying something else again
somebody said that why could she cut it into halves but the book said they couldn t because they already marked the lace it is already marked it was already marked let us go to the next one
you give it yeah how many inches of the blueberry lace did brianna get brianna got 16 inches of the blueberry lace is that what this represents yes so is this 13rd so the whole of this is 13rd
yes so you cut them into a piece a piece a piece which means this one here is also how much 13rd and this is how much 13rd so when they come to this point they have done what when it is finished it is over what
what 3 over 3 that is 33 okay here so if this is 16 from here to here is how much 16 if we add them all up do we have 48
do yes any question for them no thank you b
see we are working backwards because people decided they would rather play than do the work go take the marker over there
go let us go go 2 more friends joined the hike
each wants a fair share of the licorice lace sid has to add more marks to the lace he is stuck with the marks he already made sid makes new marks so that the new marks together with the old marks question number one draw a picture to show how sid can add marks to the licorice lace so that it has equal size pieces and can be broken to serve 6 people
hikers so this is the parts that it is broken into
yeah one hiker is share of licorice how about here particular 3 sixths 16th of the whole licorice thing so one hiker will only get 16th
leg why did you go to the middle to show us the 3 sixths to show what because it has got because the middle looks show me 16th from the beginning here it is an extra space so this is the expressed space this is not part of it
line yes so this is like a journey yes so this is the starting point that is your 0 then and this is where they ended yes this 6 is yeah but you marked there this is the whole yes this is a whole here this is the last is this the end yeah okay so this is where your 66th should be
so if this is 6s one 2 3 4 5 and a 6 okay you are blocking the way you said each behind you are going to so you guys said each hiker gets 16th which is 8 each hiker gets 116th of what of the 48 inches and 48 divided by 6 equals 8
so this 8 inches one hiker is share would be 8 inches so this is it here so one 2 3 4 5 6 okay because 8 16 24 yes 32 40 and 48
24 no you say the camera will not see you laying down there please 24 what is this one 32 what is this one
48 so and each is what an 8th 16th thank you any questions for this group
group yes tell us what happened in your group cause we did not understand the questions we thought at 1st we thought we were supposed to do the eighths too sixths and eighths but we figured out we were only supposed to do sixths so you guys figured out about it the time we were supposed to come back to the rug no when did you guys figure that out again because you guys were we would have figured out more but wanted to just leave so
are you serious yes i am serious okay okay let us see if we reached our goal were people able to recognize the role of the numerator and the denominator
yes is there anybody here who does not know what numerator represents anybody what the denominator represents steady were people able to use fractions as operators to find the actual measure of a fraction yes i do not get that you do not get that the whole thing you did you were given length
then the fractional measurement you use that give you a better understanding of the equal parts some people did do multiplication some people did division as and them did you know that to show and i think other groups did that too
did we understand the need to consider the size of the whole comparing fractions yes so was part of your confusion not understanding what to do with the whole in your group no it was just like we did not like read the question right so you people did not read for meaning and once we did it was all set far is everybody on board here
down and before we start can somebody tell us what we have been working on in math j the numbers that all right so we talked about the ones
10s the 100s the 1000s and we ve talked about the value of that digit practicing can somebody besides tell us what we have been practicing d where to put them all right what place to put them in
we ve been practicing rounding rounding we ve been practicing just for math though we only want to talk math yesterday were we subtracting we were practicing zeros we were practicing subtracting zeros
s what s the number that we worked with that s in our book 0s the 1000s book we made a 1000s book and we said there were 2 strategies when subtracting using 1000
d by using the 1000 chart and 1000 excellent so we could use subtraction excellent today we re going to use all that information to play a game how many people have played close to 100 when you were in the 3rd grade
all right so some people maybe came i know were from a different town and maybe you didn t play that 1000 so we re working with the ones the 10s the 100s when we add our 2 numbers together we will try to get 1000
can anybody think of a strategy we might use to get close to 1000 j close to 1000 if we have 23 digit numbers
and when we add these together we want the sum to be 1000 or as close as we can get okay but every time you go over or every time you go under those points count against you so you want to try to get 1000 or as close as you can get can anybody think of a strategy that we might use when getting close to 1000 so before we try we re going to try a few together but before we even try it
you should think about a 3 digit number in the 100s place excellent said you should start with the 100s place when we add we usually start with the ones
but when we want to come up with our strategy said we need to think about the 100s place 1st job so you want to make sure that these 2 digits either add up to 10 or add up to 9 if these 2 digits add up to 10 then you want something really small over here
because remember the points count against you all right can i have come up and just read what our objective is so we know what we re working on today objective then i m going to call on some people to re state the objective for us so all eyes should be on
i will use my number to cause to form 23 digit numbers that will then added together will come close to the number 100 today 2000 all right keep going i will record the sums on my game chart to determine who has the least amount of points and came the closest to 1000
job tell me one thing we re doing today in math we are we are going to find 23 digit numbers that when added together will come close to 2000 can i go a little bit over in the game
1000 but i want to get as close as i can so i don t get points against me the person with the least amount of points is the person who wins all right do we have to come up with 23 digit numbers when added together come close to 1000 today i take that information and i m going to put it on
chart you re going to have your own chart and you re going to put the information on the chart all right want so if you re lucky enough to get a wild card you should be able to get so close to 1000 if not hit it right we re going to play 5 rounds so i can show you how to do it
start teacher d yes you ve played close to 100 know can i have the 6 people who have the cards come to the front of the room
i want you to work together strategy where are you going to put those cards to get close to 1000s we want the sum of these 2 numbers to be what close to 9 they could be 9 or 10
cards can anybody you have a wild card everybody all right student j said we want to make either 9 or 10 can you see a combination that will give us 9 or give us 10 honey whose cards
step forward has a 7 and who did you want to put with step forward all right 7 +6 everybody is
back can we come up with another combination forward no just step forward in your space one you want to put it with
that s only going to add up to 8 do you think we re going to be able to get really close to 1000 if we do that d you want to use the wild card with step forward can everybody stand in this nice straight line in fact now daniel you re called forward so we want to use the wild card with with
forward so we want to either have 9 or 10 so what are we going to make the wild card over and we re going to make your card
card stand over here because we might want to change it so i m not going to write on your card because you re the wild card 10 all right we re already at a 1000 so we need to have the very smallest number we can get here emily can everybody stand and hold your cards facing forward so that the people can pick a card
so what would you honey you would like step forward and remember now we want this to be the smallest we can possibly make so and you re upside down
this okay line and what do we have left we have so what do we have left up and then can i have everybody except for go back
cards and everybody in line go back us so we have 6 +7 in the ones is nobody but 13 so we re going to put down the 3 we re going to bring up the one
is +one more is so one +one is 29 +one is 10 all right that means i have to put 23 on my chart
switch we could switch remember this is our wild card so we can do anything we want with this switch do you want to keep the wild card a 9 okay could we make this a 0
help all right let think for a minute better that s a lot of points to have against us yeah we can use the you want to try the 0 over here
here now if this adds up to 9 then i might want to have the 10s add up to something greater than 9 so that i can regroup
move although that other combination looks worse here okay
time 8 so 7 and one is 86 and one is 7 and 9 plus nothing is 978 how many more to get to a 1032 how many to get to 80 you re at 78
809100 so 1020 +2 more 2222 is a little better we did a little bit better j remember this is a wild card
9 so we can move our other cards around and see if we can come up with something closer to 1000 maybe 22 is the best we can do you don t always get good cards and you might not get as close as you would like to j the one and the 7 why don t you come up
way and let s see what we can do okay and tell us what you re thinking
see because remember you ve got that nice wild card you can put in anywhere over here over here and it s going to you want to make that a 4 no a 3 you want to make but are you going to regroup it all
anything so do you want to make that a 4 okay let s make that a 4 now how about if you move the one over here be or is that no wait a minute no no i don t like that
one you re already at 1000 so now you want this to be the smallest it can be switch hold the wild card in case we want to do it again
110 all right how far away are we from 1000 right we are going to take s all right we re going to say this is the one we re going to pick chart said she is going to pick which numbers
d what s the 1st number she made 617617 so she ll put that on her chart made 401401 what was the sum of the 2 numbers
1018 so we re going to write 1018 and how many points did we miss a 1000 by 18 so our score this time is 18 bad but it s not it s not great points if you only went one over or one under you would only get one point
but sometimes your numbers are just not going to be that good all right have the person with the lowest score wins the game
you remember when you come up you re coming this way so 2
45 and peter come up with this group shh now you re going to stand and you re going to walk right come up and stand in front of everybody
have tell us again the strategy honey 2 we re going to start with the 100s we re going to start with the 100s when we start with the 100s what are we trying to make a sum of honey the sum of we want to get close
but what are we trying to get for the sum for the when we add the 100s together right do you see a combination that would be good to start with
10 and we have no wild card this time so we have to make the 6 numbers work 10 you want to make 10 forward okay and you can only pick 2 people so step back and
back and step forward now what s 5 +5 what s 5 +510 we are already at a 1000 therefore when we put 2 digits into the 10s we want this number to be small or big
k small small we want it to be as small as we can get far stand nice and still
e step forward and step forward okay go hang yours under the 10s and hang yours under the 10s
forward going into the ones we have a 4 hang the ones and we have a 3 hang into the ones right now can i have this group go back and sit please you all right now add it for us honey
attention 4 +3 is 7 okay you can write it down 4 +3 is 73 +2 is 5 and 5 +5 is 10 excellent this time how many are we over 57570 that s not good 57 is too many points to have to make up
changes all right what changes would you like to make for your team that . 5 +5 is 10 we found that we can t this is going to be really hard to do because we have a lot of other numbers to add cards do you think it might be better to make this a 9 and work from there
there now if this is a 9 then we want the 10s to be high or low high because now we want to get as close as we can to a 1000 so we want to see if we can get 990 something 9 no
okay but does everybody see you re not going to get it the 1st time no we can do better than 57 points all right around you re going to have cards to put on your desk and you can move your cards around to get a better combination
have 2 +3 is 55 +3 is 8 and 5 +4 is 9 excellent okay now the sum is 985985 the sum is 985985 the sum is
the total is 985 excellent how far away are we from 1000 face that way honey all right 85 how many to get to 955 from 90 to the next 100 would be another 10
is 1515 so it took us 15 points to get there chart can you read the 1st to me
the 1st number is was 552
5985 and the difference between 1000 and 985 is 15 how many points do we have so far
head 18 +15 or would you like me to write it down and you can come up and add it s 18 +15 i just want to see how many points i have so far the game s not over but i just want to get an idea how i m doing
out so so far i have 33 points now remember the person with the lowest amount of points wins good you ll have to see how your partner s doing because when you do this game with your partner the person who ends up with the lowest number of points at the end of the 1st round at the end of the 1st game which is 5 rounds wins
right is there anybody who does not understand how to play partner yes tell me how many cards are we going to pass out how many cards are on the board 6
cards cards how many numbers are we making one number 2 numbers 2 numbers s 3 digits 3 digits what are we doing with the 6 cards
adding them before we add them what are we doing with the 6 cards cards we will what did we do with the 6 cards no what did i do with the 6 cards
i made 2 groups of 3 so i made a 3 digit number and i made a 3 digit number strategy the 100s i wanted to talk about the 100s 1st and i wanted the sum to be what
a 1000 well the sum for just these 2 digits i wanted it either to be a a 1010 to help me get close to a 1000 to start all right can i have tell us again what are you doing when you work with your partner will 1st you will pass out how many cards each 6 cards 6 cards each what do we do 1st pass out 6 cards pass out 6 cards each what do we do 1st
pass 66 cards each s into 2 groups you put them into 2 groups right you have to make a 3 digit number and another 3 digit number them by changing them around in different spaces excellent move them around on your desk if you don t like what it adds up to move them around on your desk
looking is this the closest i can get to 1000 and remember said that a good strategy is to start where with the ones the 10s or the 100s i can t hear you no the choices are you need to start with the ones the 10s or the 100s the 100s the 100s
100s and when we start with the 100s it needs to add up to 10 when i start with the 100s the 2 digits need to add up to excellent when i start with the 100s the 2 digits need to add up to be
or 1000s nope 9 or 1010 the 100s 100s the 2 digits have to add up to be the 100s 100s the 2 digits have to add up to the
1010 excellent i m going to give your group cards you are going to have the person i m going to hand the cards to is going to shuffle the cards and they are going to deal out 6 cards to the partner and 6 cards to themselves and then put the rest of the cards in the corner of your desk
p 9 i m handing out cards 66 cards to their partner and 6 cards to yourself to yourself okay and that s all i want you to do at 1st i didn t give you hold on
2 you ll shuffle you ll take turns shuffling give it a shuffle 1st up so remember the person i give the cards to you re shuffling the cards honey you re shuffling the cards and you re handing 6 cards to you
partner okay partner i don t know how to shuffle them best and then you re giving your partner 6 cards you re taking 6 cards
and then flip them over so you can see the numbers that you have part the shuffling is not the important part honey now i want you to spread out your 6 cards that you have on your desk
3 so you re making 23 digit numbers up everybody freeze everybody freeze nope freeze are my cards spread out 6 in a row
no i have a group of 3 a group of 3 that s what i want to see on your desk everybody 6 i want to see a group of 3 a group of 3 face up on your desk so you can see the numbers
what is this we each get 66 cards each can i have eyes up for a minute there was a question up that is a with the line under bottom that is a 9 all right when i come around when i come around honey i m going to see a group of 3 a group of 3 all facing up so i can see your numbers
on hold on doing spread your cards out cards you need 3 cards
done could i have a okay i m looking to see who has their cards spread out into 2 groups of 3 i don t see 6 honey
great if you have wilds you re lucky you should only have 6 though you have too many put one back all right now don t worry about how you have them arranged at the moment 3 now what do i look at student p
now look at the 100s go to your 100s everyone 100s in the 100s i want the sum to be either
10 all right see can you make a 9 or a 10 can t but if you have a wild card remember that can be anything you want it to be to make that 9 or that 10 right now i want you to arrange your cards so that you can get as close to 1000 as you can
and i m going to give everybody scrap paper if you want to add it up okay so arrange your cards and see how close can you get to 1000 and i ll give you scrap paper so you can add it up and see how close did you get to 1000 so add up those 2 numbers
get if you want to fold your paper in half so it doesn t take up so much of your desk that s fine want how close to can you get closer no i think you can t i would switch i can t tell you what to switch but
good now you have 5 +0 is 5 you want to make a 9 here or you want to make a 109 you could help him on this one okay if you want to fold your paper in half to save room on your desk that s fine
get did anyone get 1000 no did anybody get one.234 or 5 over no did anybody get 1234 or 5 under i shh nobody got close what did you get
together and i want you to add those 2 numbers together and i want to know if anybody got exactly 1000 then i want to know did anybody get within 5 points either way over or under fold this in half if you want so it doesn t take up so much room on your desk 0 boy you didn t get good cards sometimes you just don t you have 2 wilds so you are golden
no i got 0 wow close got 3 wild cards so he should be able to come up with a number really really close to 1000 you can raise your hand when i ask okay
remember okay again can i have a thumbs up 1000 you don t have anything added on your paper add it on your paper and see how close you got
get tell me your 23 digit numbers
loud 995 is your 1st number 326 no just 26 just 26 do you have a 0 so you had a 0
is 119 +one is is 129 +one is
p quickly because i want to have another few minutes to play before teacher h comes +236
p 6098 +10 is okay how far away are you from a 1000 you are be you re over a 1000
over 3939 so you have 39 points against you anymore i want you to put all the cards back together cards now you re going to start recording your answers because i want you to have time to play before teacher h takes her group
minute waiting for row everybody has their own score sheet right so you should be able to do 5 rounds before teacher h comes okay you shuffle them again
cards and now you are seeing how close you get to 1000 okay everybody has their own recording sheet
awesome 0 you already got that day so 6 cards make and remember we want to start with the 100s strategy try to make a 9
doing so do you want to start 5 +7 is big excellent excellent job 5 +5 is 10 and if you don t like that i liked your other combination too
one do you remember you re trying to get as close to 1000 as you can under and remember if you don t like what you get for the sum change your cards
around you can t exchange cards but you may move your cards around to come up with a different combination out and you want to make you want 2 numbers when added together will either be 9 or 10 together which one of these numbers do you want to start with
9 so 9 plus what 9 plus what is 10 more so that could be a one or it could be a 0 okay cards if this is a 9 then you want your 10s to be as close to 9 as you can get to card so you want to use
all right so now you said this is write it on your paper so you don t forget one a 7 keep going this one you said you re going to use a 9 an 8 and a 4
get so we need to all right so you said 7 +4 is 11 let s erase that honey i m going to help you
thing 7 all right 7 +4 you said is 111 you were only how many point over score and now you re going to put your 2 numbers and say equals 1001
minute is this going to be a 0 or a one i want you to practice on this no we re going to practice it on this honey and make sure you re happy with it before you put it on your chart no 9 +2 is 11 you want this to add up to 9 or 10
yeah so write down 131 here 934 and see how close
hers and look not yet is going to read me what she came up with and i want you to see how close got have look at your cards
place 9 and a you put in a 010s look at your 2 cards that are in the look at your 10s and tell me what you have and 8 and a 18 and a one what do you have in the ones column a 7 and a 4 a 7 and a 4 okay is going to add this for us
l 7 +4 is 11 put down the one okay 8 and 9 +one is 10 how far away from 1000 is one so when she does her score she only has one point over here
that is fantastic so that is what you are trying to do around i m coming over to your group and see how you re doing okay what did you come up with
no you have a wild card so you can make changes with now can you make another 99 so you can put a one right there you could put a one there
1000 okay hold on wait all right can i have eyes up
did i did 686 +300 +314 the 16 +3 is 9 +one more is
a 600 wait what is she going to record for her score did she go over no so she s going to record 0 for her score job all right let s do 5 more minutes and then we re going to do groups okay
yes that s it right there and then i got so you got to 973 so you got pretty close right now do another and then you re going to take the cards back but you have to wait for to do hers when you come up with your 1st round then you have to put the cards back together
deal take 6 new cards and come up with a 2nd round
paper no you re going to get new cards honey one all right so erase this
choice so you re going to write 281 then you re going to write +813 when you 2 are done you re going to shuffle the cards and pass out 6 more and do a 2nd round is you re going to put your sum on this line
no okay you said 8 you said 8 one 3813 all right sum 1094 how many did you go over
over 9 the 94 so your score is 94 okay now cards all back together and whoever did not get a chance to deal is going to deal out 6 new cards okay back good girl you should get a 1000 i need help okay show me what you did sum put it on your paper and add it up
10961096 so you re 96 points over better move my cards around you know what what did you say your wild card was going to be i said it was going to . don t look at this 1010 that means you want this to be the smallest amount possible
be 8 smallest the smallest number possible what s the smallest you can put here nothing so let s write on our paper 900 . 902902 you have to wait a minute honey +124 and i want to know what the sum is
126 so read that number to me 110261026 so this time you were only 26 points off so is that better
honey now you want this number plus this number to add up to 9 or 103 plus what is 93 plus how many more
9 yeah so you want your wild card not to be a 9 up okay how is this group doing
those that s a 0 a 0 and that should also be a yep yes
61515 what do you want in the 100s 100s either a 9 or a 10 so 6 plus what 0 +66 +0 is 610 so what do you need that card to be 3 you re doing really good
honey well write it on your paper and see if you like that combination
like yes excellent excellent that s a great score
rounds all right can i have eyes up minutes at the end of 2 minutes you ll need to pack up the cards the person that i gave the cards to will pack up the cards and they will seal the package and they will hand the cards back to us
you re going to put your game in your to do folder because we ll play later all right teacher h s people after we pack up i m going to send you to group okay groups 2 minutes so finish the round you re on
packing so if you re finished with that one start packing up your cards and the person that i gave the cards to is responsible for packing them up
on just finish the one you re on honey okay scrap paper and your game so you re close to 1000 sheet and your scrap paper go in your to do folder okay the cards get packed up by the person i gave them to
packing can i have teacher h s people raise your hands group and you re going come around this way i ll show you how to walk out give your cards to your partner he ll path
can i have teacher h s people please give your cards to your partner honey he ll path give me the cards wait right here and teacher f s people are coming this way with me
don t worry about that honey nope nope look at me honey that way
there you re going to walk in a nice straight quiet line all right tell her i m sorry we re late okay you nice straight quiet line working okay you need to clear your desk
cards in your to do folder g one person is packing from the group so whatever person was in charge of the cards when i handed them out that is the person packing
time when i come to your desk please make sure your cards are packed leave them on your desk say you are to walk in this direction to go to your group
c can i have the people in my group bring pencils please stand and go to your group and can i have the people in teacher d s group go to your group please
group go to your group i ll talk to you in group quick okay if you re in my group honey remember you can go in here
together have a seat you re going to be here honey you re going to be here you it is honey 1st you re going here
seat you need to sit flat honey i want you to come over here with this group for
down you need to stand you need to come here because is going to do something with
put your pencil down no you 2 are almost perfect on this you need to do the 3 s honey you 2 have this perfect you re going to work on 10s with me okay
over your partner is waiting for you
focus you re going to quiz 1st then is going to quiz you
today all right can i have you turn around honey
you okay you ready me remember it s see it say it all right shh see it say it
go 201818 good job
remember what to do no i want to remind you honey though this is one times 12 is 12 so it s a 12 with a 0 so it s 120 okay 120 all right then we re going to trade you 2 ready
yet not yet practice it 2 more times then i m going to come and quiz you 2110110 if he gets it wrong you have to tell him so you don t want him saying the wrong thing 20 nope okay
switch this is a review so is going to go 1st then you re going to go 2nd go 1015808080 so it s an 8 with a 08070902012 with a 0 look at me
that s a 12 with a 0120 a 10 with a 010 do you have any scrap paper no on 3030 that s an 11 with a 010 a 4 with a 0 close your eyes close your eyes you re getting confused
eyes 402020 okay groups because we re going to do all the ones you know and then we re going to work on the ones you don t know okay okay go
10508030806020 excellent all right now look at this
back this is 10 times 11 so it s an 11 with a 0 that 110 so 110 all right 10 times 10
cards so this is a 10 with a 0 what s that 110 times 12 so it s a 12 with a 0 how do you say that 120 excellent okay let s practice these 3 shake them up a little okay so and 11 with a 0
0 how do you say that number 110 add a 100 add a 0120 excellent you practice those 3
yet i quizzed you yesterday not today 6 doubles it s just doubles honey we re going to do 3s 3 +3 is 6 whenever you re working with 2 it s a double all right
2021 okay 1st so sit up nice and tall
j 21 it s a 1212 do it again 15303336918182724 okay
go 21 i m going to in the back i can t hear you you i can t hear your voice okay 12 you know these do you want me to do it once with you 1st let me do it with you 1st because you know these 6
12153018272451 okay all right want to try it again okay
job you need to practice your 10s okay one more time can we do the not yet has to do his 1st
ready remember doubles ready go 2410822 quiz each other one more time before i give it to you 121816 excellent job
me okay it s going to be the 3 of you ready you re going to say them together together go 6 together i heard 166
122410 doubles all right 21816822 nice job guys now you 2 are going to do no
1st i do know your brother do but you know what i ll tell you how i know your brother after okay 612 right now
go okay start again 61222 doubles yep 202410 sit still 2018 sit still
1416822 study for a minute i ll be back each okay then we have a specialist yes they are
go 405060708191101 we did that i need you to sit honey and do it one more time okay are you ready okay go 1020317110
120 perfect perfect you think you ll know the by tomorrow perfect
specialist can you not right now doing put your desks back if we took a desk and moved it
what i m going to ask you to do is those of you coming in right now take out your math books desk the video recording is already set up okay books and we re going to pick up from the other day
what i d like you to do would you join us please you ve got your math book what page did you say i ll tell you in a 2nd all right so in your math book what i want you to do if it s not in your math book it will be in your math folder
i want you to just take a quick peek at session one 7 i believe it was page 31 that we did the other day and we re going to do a similar activity today so i want you to take peek back at what we did on page 31 before we move on to page 37 session what session one 7
one 7 i believe it s page 31 6 what if we don t have it done and if you don t have it no this one we re going to do today today i want you to take a look at what we did the other day because if we do that i think if we do that things will run a little bit smoother okay
31 have a seat okay that s fine 37 could i see your book for a minute we re going to take another look at this and i want you to try something else today okay
okay if you do not have that then just take out page 37 that is fine okay so and i also have it up on the smart board so just follow along no that is fine if you have that
okay can i get a paper towel quickly so you need to look on with someone if you do not have it
look we want to find out who is winning and we are going to find a record for each set of teams and then we are going to rank them from the team with the best record to the team with the worst record and then you are going to write an approximate winning percentage for each of the teams
the difference is when we did this the last time i made you do all of the work outright today i am going to let you use your calculator okay who remembers what i let you use your calculator for the other day l to find out okay after your assessment we went over your assessment and you had a fraction
and you knew how many problems you had to solve and you knew how many you got correct and from that you found out the percentage you got on the test that yes and we found out the decimal equivalent today remember i told you that we will do this sometimes because it is more efficient and as you get older you will use a calculator more
but if you do not understand the math concept and you are just using the calculator it is not going to do you any good you need to understand the math concept and you need to be able to solve it on pencil and paper before you can use a calculator okay
so let us look at the page up here and if that is a little bit difficult for you to look at then look at page 37 in your book okay can you tell me i am looking at the wins and losses can you tell me how many actual games there were altogether
so i am going to find out what my actual denominator would be out by the lowest all of them all of them
they no one let us look at part one the dolphins the guppies the marlins the sharks and the swordfish how do i find out my denominator for any of those l by adding the wins and the losses by adding the wins and the losses
okay so if i am looking at the dolphins and i add the wins and the losses what is the total games games 49 what about guppies what about guppies
49 what about the marlins games so some are similar but they might be off by one or 2 49 swordfish 50 okay so we have a couple of teams that had 50 games and then we had a few others that had 49
that yeah so what would my denominator be if i am trying to start out with a fraction 1st what would the denominator be no just by using those numbers be 49 or 50 right okay so let us look at the dolphins
what do i want to do if i want to find out the decimal for the dolphins how do i solve that l yes what would that next step be
it would be i would do what since you don t have that many books does everyone understand what she s saying i would take 15 divided by 34 because 15 is my wins my wins which is also my numerator
and i divide that by the losses not the losses that is why i wanted to see if you would get your the total number of games played the total number of games played which is my denominator awesome so now take out your notebook 37 and you should be about done with your snack you should be about done with snack
37 but i m on page 37 like that yes you can make your i only have page 36 something right well look on with her that s fine
so i want you to write so you know you have 15 and we said 49 right
and you just told me the next step would be 15 divided by 49 time and i want your answer in your notebook so instead of you doing the long division the way you have been i want you are going to see how much more efficient it is by doing it on the calculator
yes wait wait huh when you have the answer raise your hand you are going to have a decimal you better come up with a decimal for an answer right so you are not going to tell me point are you you are going to try and tell me whether it is tenths hundredths thousandths millionths and let us say because if someone gives me an answer they might have punched in the wrong number
that is the one drawback of a calculator you have to be very careful in putting in the right information output you need to put the right information to get the right answer on the other end d 306 thousandths he got 306 thousandths 306 thousandths because the number after a 6 is a what
6 look at your calculators not 126 306 thousandths what is the number after that you have 306 and what is the very next number after 6 is that 11 so that is why we know that we do not round up
so you know that it is 306 thousandths so if you do not have this put it down 306 thousandths so you were divided by 49 okay remember that is how you get the piece
we could write it down on something you do not have yes but i want you to see that you went through all that work last time and see how much quicker is this page 37 now that is where it goes that is fine just look on with you can get it done you have enough time all right so i can not rank it until i have all of the other information right
minute let us 1st stick with the decimals guppies 38 and 38
+0 38 plus help them out 38 38 so what am i going to do as my next step
you need to divide by 49 38 divided by 49 let us see what you get
49 take the what did you get
7000 okay i looked at her calculator so that i know she has the right information but she s just having a little trouble expressing herself can someone help her out what is my decimal what is my record for decimal
75 yes 7 which is what or what
you 755 thousandths okay know 755 thousandths but i had 77 inaudible 0
7 7 5 5 so i could do this because my next number was greater than 5 okay okay attention i saw that and i did not want to give you all the information
okay okay who wants to tell me what to do so i don t have to help you at all easy i do not even need my calculator even though i want you to do it just as an exercise
50 it is the what denominator it is the denominator because it is the total what
amount of what games and my number of wins my number of wins
25 so what is my next step a you add 25 i mean yeah i know 50
m you divide the wins by the denominator student a listen so i right games so i have what are my numbers 25 divided by 50 that it is half it is half how do i write that in decimal form
5 right i am already dealing with thousandths let us try and keep it that way so how would i say that it s not 5 tenths it is not 50 hundredths we know it s the equivalent but i want to express it this way so how would i say it
right so what am i doing organizing you re close numbers 34 divided by so is saying for the sharks 24 divided by 49 here something got erased
did yeah but they all said yeah okay so that s really supposed to be a 0 no it s supposed to be a 6 but it got wiped off somehow so let me just rewrite it out okay okay
so if i divide 49 into 24 i want to see some other hands up quick you re not doing it all out on paper you re using a calculator
get what did you get 11 and 25 hundredths nope did anyone get something different
l 489 thousandths 489 thousandths and our next number is one i mean 8 i think i meant 8 okay so pretty close to the marlins aren t they
86 and my last one the swordfish what s my denominator
40 so what s my next step up one.569 should i get a whole number when i m dividing into a smaller number
i got 200 and 3 hundredths i got 8 tenths she got 8 tenths how can i write that as thousandths she got 8 tenths 800 thousandths okay
so if i want to take my decimal and convert it to percentage what s my next step remember i don t need my calculator for it but what do i do you round i round what
okay so how would i do that with 306 thousandths how can i make 306 thousandths a percentage you round up the 6 and there s one
okay so he s telling me i look at my 0 and i see 30% but i look at the next number which is greater than 5 so i round it up making it 31% okay that who can do the next one
what next one 756 thousandths 756 thousandths i want to make that a percent that s hard so they won 31% of their games that even though they didn t ask you how can i figure out how many they lost lost if they won 31% of their games what percent did they lose
69% how did you get 69% 100 you start out with always what number do you start out with 100 when i give you a test what s the highest you can get 100% so for their games they start out with their season and they can start out winning 100% of their games
but they didn t they won 31% of their games which means they lost 69% okay 756 thousandths 756 thousandths how do i make that a percent
1st you round 756 thousandths to 76 76 76% because i start out with 75 but this is greater than 5 so he knew to round up
games if they won 76% of their games how many did they lose percent everyone should be saying this 50% 50% thank you
50% this one is very close it give you the answer yep try 489 thousandths what do you think the percent would be
ooh i got it 49% how did you get that how d you get that
it it s tricky it s tricky and you got it and you didn t want to try but you got it do the wins and the losers yeah you knew there was one less than what estimated he knew that that we just did 500 thousandths and he knew that we just did 50%
and he knew that that was using the numbers 25 wins and 25 losses and he looked at the sharks and saw that they had one less win so he figured that the percent was close but what i was hoping that he was going to tell me was he looked at these 48 and he knew this number was greater than 5 so that i round this up and make it 49
c 800 thousandths how do i make it a percent 80% 80% 80% because i know 800 thousandths is equal to 80 hundredths and 8 tenths and 80 hundredths is what
best who has the best record what team has the best record swordfish swordfish 80% wins 80% wins and how many losses m 20% of wins i need 20 more percent to make 100% so they won 80% of their games and they only lost 20% of their games
who has the next best the guppies the guppies with 76% who came in 3rd 50% 4th place sharks sharks that 49% and that leaves in last place
dolphins dolphins i like dolphins i like dolphins okay
right let us do this all right you can do this me the person beside you is your partner own what is the very 1st thing i need to do before i can solve the decimal do before you join add what
what to get my denominator to get my total number of games my denominator what is my next step ivide numerator by denominator wins by total number of games means my numerator by denominator but i still do not know how to divide and get the i will help you i will help you
and then once you do that for each one after you have finished with the decimals what do you do you are working with the person beside you and if for some reason that does not work you are working on your own
okay show me you need to have your notebook out get tell me what my denominator needs to be
how do i get my denominator correct how did you do that
right but why did you get that answer i don t know yes you do you re adding the 7 and the one
so the 1st step is what s your next step
so your next step is right
good
get that s not the 1st step step can you explain to her just the 1st thing that you did and then i m going to come back and see if you can do the 2nd one okay do you understand it
huh what don t you get them yeah i ranked them all right we have to divide so 98 plus you re doing good be what do you divide it by what did you divide the other 2 by
the 2nd step some of you are forgetting as you are working independently on your own you are trying to divide your wins by your losses
you re forgetting if you divide by the total number of games the total number of games
okay so let s take a check back difficulty even though you re getting it you re just kind of forgetting a few steps and that s fine okay my wolves when i add my wins and my losses i get what
845 they didn t play that many games i don t think 125 i add 98 +27 and i get 125 games what was the next step
125 my wins by my total number of games and what did you get for a decimal 784 thousandths 784 thousandths and let s go right over here now because you know how to do this 78 78% because my 4 is lower than 5 so i keep it right at 78% coyotes coyotes total number of games they played
124 124 games and they won how many 508 if they played 124 games they couldn t have won 500
63 63 correct correct d equals 508 thousandths 508 thousandths and if i make that a percent student is what that is it yep say it louder
51% because the 8 is greater than 5 good 51% all right my bobcats how many games 158 someone help him out 124 124 96 and 28 is 124 addition 96 +28 is what 124
124 96 divided by 124 what d you get can you say it a little louder 774 thousandths i can t hear you 774 thousandths can someone say it correctly c 774 thousandths 774 thousandths good
m i got 77% 77% thank you 0 wildcats was easy wildcats was easy
s 16 hundredths we re dealing with thousandths 0 games so if they won half of their games what s their percent games the tigers
124 124 again so if i divide 16 by 124 what do i get you ll get 508 thousandths 508 thousandths just look at how close here what s my winning percent
51% okay it looks tricky because the numbers are so similar to those of the wildcats so who had the best ranking
m the bobcats the bobcats at 77% next tigers how is it here so if i have 63 divided by 124
thousandths you got what 124 can someone else do that instead of just teacher doing it now i mean the coyotes i know i m working on the coyotes right now i want someone to no i mean the tigers the tigers let us do one at a time that is 508 thousandths so let us come down we do not need to do the wildcats again
tigers what is 60 divided by 124 hand because if this team has more wins that does not make sense does it l 483 thousandths 483 thousandths right what percent
48% i will come around and show you in a minute 60 i did the last one wrong okay did we get that i got the right one i did get it right everyone understand it now
yes i m going to check back with you in a minute to make sure you re getting it understand yeah its because i didn t okay so you see what you did wrong good okay
for the group that does not enjoy the peanut i have something else that i ll substitute you with a little later after the activity now i m going to hope that out hands are clean because we just came from the restroom but if not we re going to send some hand sanitizer before we do anything with the candy because what . what do you think we re going to do with that pack of candy considering what we re reviewing
mean mode and range of good we re going to figure out the mean mode range and medium how by what colors okay we ll use the colored data information to find that out before we start . before we do an activity i need to make sure you guys understand
we ve already gone over these the 1st one is mode mean mean i wish mean mode you all okay okay give me a definition what do we do in order to find i turned over your other anchor chart because i knew somebody would be looking for people looking over and that
0 that s right over there i turned it over so you can t see it because i want a new definition t we add up all the numbers and then we divide by how many there are all right we add up all the numbers
do we agree with that yes then we what
then we divide by the numbers . by how many numbers there are all right i m looking for a definition for median
somebody give me an example of it if she speaks to you one more time you leave median m the median is the number that is in the middle the median is the number that is in the middle give me an example of what teacher d talked about being a median that we see almost daily and where we would see it at
remember 0 my d the interstate it s the interstate or the the highway what is it the who can help him k what do i say
if i wanted to go across the street to the toysrus that i would stop at this particular thing what the island it s an island located in the what middle of the road middle of the road
shrubs so the median would be the number located where in the middle in the middle middle if i have 6 numbers hjow would i find the median there
if you have 6 numbers you would have to find the number in the middle what if there s 6 of them how could i find the number in the middle if i got 3 on top and 3 on the bottom you take 2 and multiply it ah you are so you add them close you add them take the 2 where take the 2 closest to the middle and the 2 numbers in the middle and add them add them up and what do i do with the sum 0
you add you in the middle he is like hot you add 2 numbers in the middle and divide them by 2 divide them by 2 and that will find my new median mode i learned something new when we were doing this of all right what s missing from my definitions range
what if i told you i couldn t do that how else would you tell me
biggest biggest number between the smallest and biggest number all right and someone said difference all right so we understand all the 4 items that we re looking for i the mode and in the mode exactly
and before we start i need some wonderful student to read the directions for me some wonderful bright student to read the directions for me m on the front of the page read the directions for me
top and we are all familiar as to what we have to do i need you to read the directions so that the camera and everybody else can hear
read the read each question carefully and circle the correct answer keep going if you do not remember how to figure the median you look at the explanation below or look in the math finder all right so i have the information up here on the wall as well as on the bottom
do the median is the number that falls exactly in the middle of a set of data when the data are . when the data are arranged in order from least to greatest okay from least to greatest or from greatest to what least all right you have exactly 4 minutes
work with your partner on questions one through 54 minutes
4 minutes if wants to work by yourself then work with and . yes well you can work with or you can scoot over with this group okay
you want to come work over here with yes
huh why is working by herself in a group of 4
up either you set it up from least to greatest or from the greatest to the least when you set them up what the mean huh but if you don t set it up you re going to fall for that umm median
t the middle then you can go ahead and sheet if you re working ahead 0 can we have half the can you sit down
mean i see some people finding the mean the number s located in the letters so you count 123 no do look at the bottom read that last sentence for me
going to have so many different answers yay looks yes if you worked ahead go to the next page and we ll do the next 5 if you ve worked ahead yes
what if you finished it turn over to the next page
stop pencils down hold this all right i m interested to find out how where we did i saw some people finding the median i saw some people finding the mean which was a little too much number one what is the median of the following number 167715 and 5
8 and 7 do we agree yes number 2 what is the median of the following numbers 125132 and 8 number letter c do we agree yes number 3 what is the median of the following numbers a 1998199 and 86
a says 99 do we agree yes good number 4 what is the median of the following numbers 205020105040500 there were some more numbers there b says 40 job what is the median of the following numbers and they get bigger here
462550550 what i would be interested in finding out not right now who can find the mean for number 5
not right now but before the end of this lesson i ll need somebody to give me the mean in number 5 all right now i want you to stop what you re doing and you have in front of you a white sheet of paper paper one is to and please don t touch those because i don t want you to break out okay one is to pour the candy on
the other one will be for you to record your information so at this time and we don t have much time i want you to do one bag of candy and there s 4 groups so one group could do one bag one set of 2 could do one bag while the other set of 2 could do the other yes
you need to what teacher yes would you please not yet
yet hand sanitizer s going around put the paper that you were working on neatly do we need our scratch paper i m giving it to you now if you haven t put any hand sanitizer on your hands don t touch that candy it s coming
d i know i want to do a you ll just be the 1st to have it done to get through your all yes wait you guys need 2 white sheets of pinks all right your group should each person should have 2 teacher d
2 white sheets can i have one extra all right clap once if you can hear my voice clap twice all right and we re still talking all right here and this is what i want you to do
2s there are 2 bags of candy correct yes yes all right you re going to divide into 2s one and i ll wait me yes okay what i want you to do is to open your candy
pour it on one sheet of white paper the other sheet what are you going to do t okay well what are we going to write on that clear sheet how are we going to find that you re right we re going to find the mean the mode i ll wait
do somebody s . you need to listen you need to listen what you need to do is on the 2nd sheet you re going to write the colors and how many of each color it is are we clear on that yes all right i m going to give your group your set of 2 about 7 minutes long i ll give you 5 because we need to move on
go darling you might want to give me that so i can put it in the trash yes that s one less ones you have you know that right get started i like the way some people have automatically started grouping them into colors
borrow thank you why do both of you all have some i mean it doesn t matter
fine just make sure that you all that s all one bag of m m s right together you re all both doing it on a piece of paper that s why i said why do you have both
i don t have one of you all needs to record how many of what is where are you going to record the numbers of the candies yes yes
helps brown black brown 0 that was before it was 3 red what about you say you had 3 red huh m m s regrouping into ate it it we counted start doing it on your own 0 you got it
you don t have a mode but you got the rest 0 mode that s why we have 123456 why where s your bag of candy right there you need paper you need white paper break it into 2
yeah the mode did the mode i like that
m m s huh okay so now that you got the information i see a mode already you see a mode
no you can t do that to help us eat them well wait a minute you do have a mode huh no
most the most the most of what number you see ah so what is your mode red and brown 5 red and brown how many are there 55 so your mode is
work we found the mode and we re let me see bags why didn t you use bag and do it twice twice that s what that s why you all finished fast wow that is a lot of brown skittles its 16 browns 11 reds 11 yellows so you have a mode then i heard some number
1616 really that s the most mode okay write it down then if you re sure about that though 16 is your mode yep because it s the more it s more than wow no no no no no what we got to put them all together 8 you tell me 16 because ate it
the mode okay so you re saying the mode is the biggest maybe i need to take these meanings these definitions out because i have a couple people telling me their mode is the most i put . i could almost be 199% certain that we talked about the mode
t the mode is the number you see the most the number you more than one the number you see the most so if i see 3 and then i see 3 again the i see 3 again would that be the most that i have or would that be the mode that would be the 0 you found it found it s 11 really and why is it 11
because the the red the red and the yellow is the same amount okay do you have any more 11s there no no so now that you found the mode what else do you need to find go the median the median is yes
yet huh you have to wait mean okay you guys got about another 2 minutes we should be done good i like the way you girls have gone on and moved that to your work package because that s what i want you to do
the mean s probably and the range is 5 where s the median 00 the median is 4 all right one more minute if you have clap once clap twice clap 3 times
if you have already found your mean your median your mode and your range then quietly start working on page 2 of your activity if not you have about another minute to get that information together
yeah you guys should have why you don t have anything yet have what is the median the mean is 2 you add up all the numbers add up all the numbers i don t get it it because because the mean because you just did it all on a paper 7 before we started and now you say you don t get it
why 30 seconds 0 so median s 7 no 8 how do you know it s 8 i know how do you know it s 8 i you where did you line your numbers up from highest to lowest 8910 so you know that it s 8 you just picking up a number and guessing
123456 why are you counting by ones if she s already you ve already counted divide it many how many colors do you have we have 123456 colors how many colors do you have 5 colors 5 colors so you divide that number by 5 divided by 2 so no
no add it up and divide by 2 i know 15 i m looking for the groups that are ready because we need to share some information
i know some people are dying to put chocolate in their mouths yeah skittles or skittles all right i m ready so i do have a few people that are still working but for those that are finished i need to know a volunteer only
wait a minute somebody else is still talking while you re talking we added all the numbers 17 5 2 3 4 and 8175234 and 8 and you got we got 39 so whoa whoa whoa 1752348 is that correct yes okay can we have you real quick i m going to cross out the 8 and the 2 because that will give me 10
that s 410 +7 is 17 that s 5 and 17 +5 is how much +5 is 2222 +7 is 29292 +one is 39 that yes yeah all right now how many numbers did they have total
666 so they took 6 and divided it into 39 and they got 6 with a remainder of 3 no all right what was your median our median was 4 remainder whoa and why was it 4 remainder one
2342 it s 3 it is 3 thank you
15 we subtracted 17 from 2 all right i need to hear from somebody with some skittles quickly on our mean yet
ready yes all right somebody is so rude because they re steadily talking whisper it on well our colors were green orange red yellow and purple green orange red yellow and purple
good for green we had huh for orange we had 11 wait a minute 15 i m going to ask this group over here one more time to lower your voice because i can t hear i understand you re still working on it but i need you to just take it down a notch
bag for red we had 1212 for orange we had 1111 is 12 +416 +51234561 what did you do with your 61
we divided by 5 all right 61 divided by 5 what did you get 12 remainder one good so your mean was 1212 one yes all right what about your mode
no okay no mode can you tell me why you didn t have a mode because we didn t see the no no number that was the same as all of them okay no number we saw twice okay was it that you had no number that was the most or the number that you seen more than one time the number we seen more excellent all right can i get the median 12 median
range 66 how did you get 6 because because we subtracted 15 from 9 wait a minute we subtracted say it again 15 from 9 say it again 15 from 9 say it again you can t subtract 15 from 9 so i want you to say it the right way
ooh 0 way take . 9 from 15 thank you
correct all right all right i m going to wait because we are don t have about 2 minutes can somebody they have the same amount good was your bag similar or your number similar to theirs mine were skittle sours okay yours were skittle sours so it was a little different
no skittle sours skittle sours okay we don t have enough time but we do want to compare i need to find it somebody got that mean for number 50 on the front page and i m going to go with 540 is that the mean ooh
704700 what did you get 550 that sounds like the median i wanted the mean if you divide okay if you divided it by what divide it by 5 you re supposed to get huh 550 okay if you divide what wait a minute if you divide 2 2750 divided by 5 then you would get 550
552 of you came up with that already told me 540 okay we got you got to give me a minute you said you got to give me a minute you got to give me a minute all right this is somebody can summarize what we just did because we need to go to p e
i need somebody to raise their hand and summarize exactly what we talked about today or just tell me exactly what went on
m we divided skittles by their color we . we by their color and then we tried we were trying to find the mode the median and the range okay any body else
your voice is off pull that off and then do my little mug shot pose it your number okay thank you you re welcome i m number 428
girls i was worried about yesterday so i went home and i got out some information and studied to be sure that we were clear about what we were doing yesterday and how many people were confused and we talked about what we do for division how we do it in the us algorithm setup and then the big 7 which a lot of people knew right
d so i can t seem to squish this on here but i m going to go for it as best i can i m going to squeeze in my 54 cause i have one group of 54 here way 70 take away 54 leaves me with 16
so revisiting the big 7 which we left off at yesterday
we take the numbers and set it up very similarly in the brackets so that it s 2500 divided by 54 but instead of doing it all the way that you ve learned for so long with me you go with groups of 1010 and then i went to 20 and then i said 0 i can do another group of 10
and then i couldn t do a group of 10 but i could do a group of 5 hi a garcia
about once i ve got to this point let s make sure we re all clear on this lights i m just helping the screen but what do i do with these up did anybody go home in their practice last night with their homework and use this system
sense yes so you understand now that you can do this and you can do this right there s a 3rd way there s a 3rd way okay okay let s go back to what i m doing here for the big 71st
40 +5 45 +one 46
okay let me show you the 3rd way that i just was blanking out yesterday the 3rd way is adding up and it requires a little bit of multiplication as well here it s a multiplication i m sorry
it s a division but it s adding up because you have to figure out how many groups of 54 are in 2500 in this particular problem correct yeah so this is the way that my little book here shows you how to do it and it makes a little bit of sense to me remember that i ve talked to you about this over and over again and there s more than one way to get to the answer
so we have 54 and we know that we have to add them up and we are going to come up with a series of adding them up adding up the sum of that times something else to get it right so let s start here with 54 and multiply it by 10
d do you see how user friendly this is do now i m trying to get to my goal number which is 2500 isn t it
shot 10500 -500 no what i m trying to do is get a list of numbers i can add up that will come as close as possible to 2500 so i m using 54 and i m multiplying it by numbers that are simple
that knowing that that s the case over here what did i use 1080 does that make sense that 20 groups of 54 equals 1080 yes 1080 is 2 times as big as 540 isn t it yes i need you with us and you look like you re digging for gold over there go 54 times 20 equals what 1080
1080 now i m going to add these 0 +04 +8 12 1020 how close to 2000 remember that my goal is i m going to put this up here
1620 that s what on the rock in plymouth no it isn t that s the year that the pilgrims allegedly landed in plymouth okay them you re going to add them
multiply okay so do you see that what we re doing is solving a multiplication problem i m sorry a division problem by using multiplication up i want your attention 100% of your attention add 0 and 02 and 466 and 5 11
carry a one i have 2160 now for 2500 even let s think about this for a minute sense am i going to be able to put another 540 with this no see how easily you can do this because you re using groups of 10s and easy numbers to double up and add with and work with
work what could work to help make our lives easy t 54 times 5 54 times 5 and if i know that 54 times 5 is what i m doing do you understand how simple it is to break 540 in half yes what s half of 500
315 what s half of 500 250 what s half of 40 20 so 250 +20 is 270 what was that with your hand up
270 so i m going to say 54 times 5 is 270 13 13 carry the 11 and 2 is 42 is 2430 can i fit any more in here to get as close to
i need a group of yeah yes 2500 many 12 she says 2 no 111 54 times one is 54
0 +4 is 43 +5 is 884242 am i almost to 2500 remainder remember how much more
16 16 more okay here we now have to go back into this section of work that we just did highlight and we have to say well how many groups of 54 did we use remember that we started with a problem that is division the division problem is 2500 by 54 right
so we have to add this group of 10 this group of 20 this group of 10 this group of 5 and this group of one look 10 201010 same numbers and i bet if i started looking i would probably find some of these numbers that are here over there or over here
okay so how many groups of 54 fit into 2500 46 i m writing it here because we re running out of space and what was my remainder again when we figured out how much more i would go how many more to get to 490
6 plus another 10 would get me to 2500 me i mean on the sides where the arrows are so i just want you to pay attention to the fact that this answer matches this answer matches that answer yes
ask who to move move scoot to the right scoot to the left right i think what i m going to ask you to do right now is let s go back to what we started yesterday
we ll get a fresh new sheet and i m sorry i cause i thought today was my turn right now this is the same thing day after day and i m telling you with every kindness ounce in my heart knock it off
okay there s 4 pages way i m going to have you compare what you did yesterday and how it goes for you today
off does that help you i was never aware of that doing moving the page up and down okay here s what i would like for you to try
how many people know how to do the us algorithm with regular straight old division do all right let me just remind you that you didn t when you got here a lot of you said i don t get it and look at you get it now place i want you to do the same problem you did last night
if you did the big 7 i d like for you to try it this way up so you re going to take problem number one which is 768 divided by 32 and i would like for you to add it up night okay
if you did the standard us algorithm last night and you didn t do the big 7 i d like you to do the big 7 thing whatever you did last night i want you to do a different way today time and then the 2nd time cause it tells you to do it 2 ways i want you to do a different way again
you yes i want you to try and know how to do it 3 different ways do you know why doing this 3 different ways is a good idea b in the test solve it in problems not using us algorithm they might throw out at us at the test a that you need to solve it in a different way other than the united states algorithm
however you can also check your work if you know 2 ways to do it sense in other words let s say you do the us algorithm and when you get all done you re just not sure up let me see if i add it up if i get the same answer as if i were to do the us algorithm
sure if you do it 2 different ways and get the same answer both times what does that tell you that you re right that your answer is right yes so everybody s working choosing our number 13 whichever you didn t use for homework last night
clear yes if you aren t sure of what you are doing and you are stuck i m going to be walking all around the room and i m going to watch and see if i can help you right yes ma m i don t get the big 7 the big 7 okay and you said you don t understand the big 7 yeah okay
7 all right take your stuff and go sit over here
down we re going to go big 7 all together everybody the big 7 is called the big 7 because it looks like this
right when i 1st learned how to do this i said why but when you see how it helps us with issues like multiplying big numbers it makes perfect sense so i m going to go with 27 and 371
that so in truth if i were reading the problem it would be 3429 divided by 27 okay so i am going to say okay let s do this the simple way i want your attention
okay what is it for me to take 27 and multiply it by 10 270 so over here i write the number 10 and underneath this i write 270 do you see how small 270 is compared to 3429 okay so let s think about this differently okay
subtract 9 take away 0 is 92 -7 can t be done so we re going to borrow 12 take away 7553 take away 2 is one 270 let s do a bigger number with something easy to multiply 270 by
270 you know 10 times 27 is 270 100 ooh why because you re adding 2 zeroes to 270 100 so 100 times 27 is what
2700 how quick is that 2700 and it works because this number is what to 3159 smaller it s smaller it has to be smaller 9 -095 -051 -7 can t be done
borrow 11 -744 and 2 take away 2 is 0 what is it making better sense to you guys c you should not be working on that math when we re doing this math
but those numbers on that paper are different i know you re not doing yourself any favors if you re not giving me 100% 459 how many groups of 27
yes yes what s 270 times 2 what s 27 times 2 54 look at the number we have
459 is 20 times 27 going to work nope so let s go with something smaller that s a nice easy round number k let s do 10 and then 5 i ll show you why
189 so then said 5 right yeah what s 270 in half
135 so if i say 5 times 27 it s 135 work yes do you understand why we re using 10s and 5s now yeah and then as we get closer to the answer what are we doing with our numbers as we get closer to the answer getting smaller numbers smaller numbers
is 48 -35 54 and 27 what how much is 2 times 27 head do we have a remainder
54 what s our answer stop right there you guys have to pay attention to where the answer comes from here right what s our answer
hi how ya doing no next week payday thank you you re welcome 127 is our answer
127 so not only does that mean that 3429 divided by 27 is 127 it also means what can you flip that and turn it into a multiplication problem it what is it 127 times 27
3429 the opposite of division is multiplication and what did we just use here you guys we used multiplication division addition all of that stuff 7 practicing so right now the big 7 is the problem you re going to do
that goes across the board because there s too many people who say i don t understand it everybody take problem one the 1st way where it says on your worksheet the 1st way i want you to divide 768 by 32 using the big 7
go what honey use on this one you did it you just did both already
now well i got this and i got 24 and here i got i didn t get that that whole group is breaking up k i know it s hard but you re going to have to try to ignore them right here
this is what you just said is 32 times 204 equals 768 right because the opposite of division multiplication is 204 a reasonable answer no
you just did the big 7 110 and 4 100 32 times you have 100 32 times 10 equals 320 100 do you see that
it would be 200 if i did that if you multiplied 32 times 100 you would have 3200 wouldn t you 320 now you re adding up these numbers and what are you getting is what do you need to do to these 2 100s to make it work
make em lower it s not that they need to be lower removed the 4 the 2nd 0 because it s 10 times 32 equals 320
understand if i took the 2nd zeroes off it would be and then i can hm and then this answer up here is what you got to begin with this answer would be the same so what you made a mistake in is saying 3 zeroes right okay
one yes boys and girls if you ve done all of the 1st side let s go i was going to ask you but i don t get the big 7 you don t get the big 7 and there it is right there in front of you the way i did it with those numbers now you have to put it on the page the same idea
i need to ask you if the same thing that happened yesterday before you came to school happened again today so you are going to the nurse right now to tell her that and call mom okay i told you that you needed to let me know 1st thing in the morning go you are having too many issues with your friends and that s why okay so get a pass and fill it out and you re going to the nurse to call your mother
do i have it right good good
okay do you need to divide or can you use multiplication how i can do 32 times 76 why what number should you put out here blue okay
so not the same problem but what s the thing about those numbers up there 2 they all equal 127 no i m asking you to tell me what you see running down the side for example if i took 32 and multiplied it by 10 put 10 here
320 write 320 underneath that number do you want to do what go this is too important
this this is why i tell you guys to leave these pens at home you re not supposed to use lead pencils in this room
here you took 10 groups of 32 and got that time 4 times equals 48 to 32
way which is adding and taking another number like a 10 or a 100 or a 20 something easy to multiply by 32 you that zeroes are easy to work with okay
with but i m asking you to think in groups of base 10 counting and i m asking you to think what if you put another 10 here bathroom what s 10 times 32 write it down underneath the 448
what now you have 1281010 times 32 is 320 no sound check
boys and girls if you re focused and working and you ve finished your 1st 2 ways to do number one go on to number 2 bathroom but everybody has work to do bathroom i m sorry when you re done with that do number 3 at the bottom
i already did that okay then you re going to have to give me a minute m 31s on the board you need that back how many groups of 32 will fit into 128 do you think let s try 2
that was 16 14 engaged i see you kind of off and not really focused there okay what do you know
that wait what do you mean like about 32 do you just said 2 groups of 32 equal 64 have you still need one more number over here to finish this
it 2 times 32 is 64 yes now you ve subtracted 64 from 128 and you ve got another 64 now say that what times 32 equals 64
2 so write another 2 here
22 really wait no 0 but you re going to put it up on that line too
okay before you forget what you just did try it over here and do it with this same thing k it s just different and once you see it you ll be like ah this makes it fast here i m stuck on the next step you re stuck on the next step
7 yes so you subtracted 10 groups and are you doing it too it well i m trying what you got here 768 divided by 32 32 erase from here down
quick right here you did 10 groups of 32 equals 320 and when you subtracted you got okay got your new number that you re looking at is 448 you need now to figure out how many groups of 32 to multiply i m sorry
this you need to multiply 32 by something that s easy so that your new answer to multiplication is less than 448 easy look at this look at this again 0
groups what would you get if you multiplied 32 by 10 there you know that 10 groups of 32 equals 320 don t you
this you already know this is the case don t do any more crunching numbers when you know it 0 you re working harder than you need to smarter 320 i think what you re doing is making this harder for yourself you think it s harder than it is 8 take away nothing
10 you don t have to compute that 32 add a 0 to the end of that now all right so now you need to think about it
can you take 10 groups of 32 away from 128 right so can you take 10 groups of it big it s too big
how about if you looked at 32 and you said well what if i just i want to try maybe 2 groups of 32 right here what s 2 groups of 32 64 subtract here
10 okay now you have 448 this 320 from 768 now 10 times 32 is 320 again no can t you can t subtract 3320 from 448
0 yes okay 320 write it down underneath there something i need to use the bathroom then use the bathroom excuse me check in 2 minutes i m going to be at the board and we re going to go through this whole problem together
32 you just said 32 times 2 is 64 right you subtracted 64 from 128 and what did you get 64 so now what is the next number that you re going to put in this column to finish this problem
while i want you to put 64 there and you can because you know that this times this is 64 but you already have it for one time so what goes here job you may go okay
equal 10 20 24 what s the answer okay do you have your work done need some help 0 my goodness
are who is it
c hm wonderful day 2
2 please boys and girls let s pay attention to the problem that you are required to do please me eyes on me you are checking the way you used the big 7 to do problem number 11st
okay 768 divided by 32 correct okay i m not going to take questions right now started so you re going to set up the big 7 by making your giant 7 you re going to put 768 in here
computing some people like to just come up with what can i do with 32 sometimes they say 32 times 10 equals 320 32 times 20 is going to equal what 320 and tell me what the answer is
640 what if i tried tripling 320 e 900 something 900 what 960 so if i did 32 times 30 it would be 960
that hm so some people like to do that because before they even start because it helps to put numbers in front of them that are going to help them 768 are any one of these numbers going to help us r 32 times 32 times 10
it i can do 32 times 10 you re right and we did that when we did it with you 20 is the answer to that 640 less than 768 sense because you can take 10 and double it and get 20
so you can do 10 take away 320 or you can do 20 and take away 640 it work smarter not harder right done what s 32 times 20 all you geniuses 640
easy see how fast it makes it happen because you re doing this 640 take 640 away from 7688 take away 0 is 86 take away 4 is 27 take away 6 is one do now what shall we do 32 times 4 how do you know 32 times 4
because 324 times 8 as in 3 times 4 okay so i m going to put 4 over here some people did 2 and then 2 again and that s all right also we re just making the multiplication with bigger numbers faster
128 so all i have left is zeroes and this is what i add here how many people got this correct how many people are going 0 my gosh i totally get the big 7 now i m so happy for you
but there are people who didn t and for that reason okay k i would suggest that you finish and get yourself back to your seat what was the 2nd way that somebody did this same problem who wants to share
down you did this regular way what i already pulled somebody
go i divided twice and i got 64 subtract that and i had 128 i know what i did now
a little differently that s okay now do you see how when you do a problem more than once it helps you see if your answer is right or wrong
nice 128 we saw 128 in the last problem didn t we because he multiplied 4 times 32 which gave him 128
and 20 times 32 is actually 647 not us algorithm
page how much gum do you have in your mouth today on gum day hah all the people on the video are going to be like why is that whole class chewing gum we re raising money i know i said wait excuse me we re going to let talk you re going to listen to
go you guys if it were you up here you would want everybody to be listening to you why is that not happening go then i added it up do you guys see that
768 i know no
go and highlight the numbers you add do you guys see that what she s doing what she did was she added the answers to her multiplication problems which is correct because now she has 768 which is where your goal number was answer did anybody else do this way
okay so how many people did 968 divided by 48 what okay i am going to put it on the board set it up and i m going to ask somebody to come up and perform the big 7 for us
0 no 48 is about to show us how he performed the big 7
go wait a 2nd 0
with when we do the big 7s boys and girls what are the numbers we re going to go for 1st j 5s 10s 5s 100s sometimes 20s
favor to avoid confusion can you erase shut up is not appropriate in this class off 10 groups of 48 are 480 done
right yes write close and small that 16 take away 88 and 8 take away 40
now are you starting to see that this see 480 yes and look this is what he took away has what s going to be a quick easy way to go right now do it 11 you said no i didn t i did say do it but i didn t hear you say 11
what times 10 equals 480
what times 10 equals 480 right 10 here okay
what you re pushing the button on the pen button okay what and what is it no no no no
answer what is 8 what is 8 remainder 8 is the remainder so what is the answer favor before you walk away from the board i need this as a number sentence with the answer there crazy anybody want to help with what a number sentence is you guys should know this
a number sentence boys and girls i saw tests that i have given you guys
and you have been putting number sentences together backwards and you have not realized that a number sentence is written
a why is this not correct why it s backwards well i can
what you just wrote up here is that you have 48 pieces of bubble gum on gum day and you are dividing those into 968 equal portions 968 the big number
1st you do that excuse me because this is written this way week you have to remember that this is just the way we solve it us you just keep on yelling my name out and that does not work in my world
i m sorry what in how many people understand that she knows that that s the remainder because that s too small to be divided by 48 no in this point in your lives
okay i would like for you to we don t have time to go on to the next lesson i want to give you another problem and i want you to use some i ll give you some math paper
moment i want to see what you can do i m going to assess you right now this listen to my directions please are you listening to my directions
paper hi again one for and you guys each got one this you re fine you want to leave it on for the assessment
okay 54321 you be careful near the tripod if you have extra paper just put it in the middle of your group
paper i want you to fold it in half like a hamburger turn it sideways and put your name in the top left hand corner understood this is just me knowing that you know what you re doing i m going to collect these when we re done
i want you to show me 2 ways to divide this problem 7 you may use what else
up or you may do what us algorithm you may use the us algorithm today in our class these are the 3 that we confirmed that you re all clear on great these are the 3 that you need to show me you know
k that s it problem got it yes yes 2 ways
good one way is going to tell you an answer and when you do it the 2nd way what s the 1st way going to help you with that that number is wrong
again okay where s your remainder remainder right there okay change nice
it so smart good job
mean what s that answer i wonder why that is 32 how much times does it go into i don t want you to ask that i want you to ask how many groups of 32 in a nice easy way
pencil let s say we multiply 32 times 10 what would that equal you know my trick what s one times 32
there so instead of you doing 32 times 10 try writing another math sentence that says 32 times 20 understand double that twice if you double 320 what will the answer be 640 do you see how quick you just gave me that answer
you how you doing honorable here adding up e how are you doing
2 number 2 you re trying to get the old fashioned way this is this us algorithm go look at you got what s the matter i m stuck i m stuck
okay boys and girls i m going to give you 5 minutes more of time to wrap this up paper okay done if you want to do 3 ways for a bonus you can do that if you have a 3rd way that s not us algorithm big 7 or add up that s fine
i ll give you a bonus but you have to have 2 of those that s the only 2 that i m taking as what we ve been working on all day the add it up because the add it up think about 320 but think about 32 and multiply it by 10 right 0 great i ll get you another pencil
work when you finish the 2nd way you can go and until then no senor you re stuck think how much is it
32 times 10 is 320 right so what if you said 32 times 20
excuse me you need to be considerate of the people around you that are working about if it were me beside her sitting here working would i be talking to distract people or focused and working together i would put a line between it so you know what you did when you look back
did 0002 +4 is 63 +6 is 9 good 1464 you need to get to this point
now please be sure your notation is clear and concise
you need to be able to look back at it tomorrow or 3 days from now and know what you did and why you have to add those up and subtract that to that or do you just subtract the 640 let me catch up to you 30 if you put 30 right here you can subtract this much from this
so if you put 30 30 okay now see the sum of 320 and 640 is 960 write 960 underneath 1464
jaguars does it have the lead in it
you are going to be reviewing today and part of tomorrow there is one skill though that i want to reintroduce we already covered it from the last unit
iphone the phone is let us say $392.68 we are going to buy that iphone but only let us say 4 of you guys can buy it
4 we have to determine here how do we do division that involves a decimal we can do it just like we would do any kind of problem our divisor is going to be 4 and our dividend will be the price of the iphone
we are going to be asking ourselves the same questions but before we do that we have got to make sure we place our decimal point where it should be before we do anything obviously with our other problems where we had a whole number we did not have to worry about the decimal we did have to worry about it here before you worry about anything or get confused just place the decimal point directly above where it should be
question yes i remember how to multiply decimals now i remember on the 1st day i forgot that we did it but now i remember exactly we have already done this but i just want to refresh your memory and it is just going to give us a chance to reinforce long division as well 30
how many 4s are there now in 39 you are asking yourself 4 times what comes closest to 39 without going over
4 times 7 is 28 can you go any higher than that without going over 4 times 9
9 i am asking one person
m remember these from math facts this is something you guys should be working on every day it is part of your newsletter it says to practice your math facts
9 what is it rules so after we multiply this you are going to subtract it just like you always do
39 -36 is 3 and what are we going to do with the next digit here 8
we have come up with our little helper to make sure we understand all the skills here in long division and that is mc donald is serves burgers we have multiplied and got a 36 39 that s the s and then we brought down the 8
down so we are going to start the process all over again you have a question hold on for a 2nd because right now i see one of your classmates who is disrespecting you talking can you turn around completely with your back off the wall
see i can do this in my head 6 do we have to borrow anything so we are going to start the process all over again
how many 4s are there in 38 facts we do not want to go over 38 but we want to get close to it
hold on for a 2nd what i am a little disappointed in is that you have to call on someone for your math facts that is why i put on your weekly newsletter to study these every night if you do not know them you should know 4 times what is going to get you close to 38 am i correct
someone i want to make sure that the rest of the week you want to go back and make sure you know the 4 times tables and what the rest of them are going to be 4 times 9 is 36
36 we are going to do our s subtract so what are we going to do next
6 okay so just because the decimal point is there does not mean we do not bring it down we are trying to find out how many 4s are there in this entire number not just enough of a whole part of a number but in the decimal part as well
26 what are we going to do next i think you are going to excellent what question are we going to ask ourselves how many 4s go into 26 exactly and want to help us out with that one what was the question you should not even have to hear it because you should know what the next step is
how many 4s are there in 26 without going over 4 times 26 you are saying 4 times 26 is 26 4 times what gets us closest to 26 without going over
6 good 4 times 7 is 28 and that goes over 6 that is going to be 24
on we are going to bring up our 2 bring that down and i am going to very quickly go through this because i think it is just a matter of math facts how many 4s are there in 22 without going over subtract there is a 2 here
we all know now there is going to be a 2 and that would be 0 always on the end remember this is 2 and then i will bring that how many 4s are there in 20
so the answer using a whole number divisor and a dividend that has a decimal point is 99.655 it was even so hold on
let us go back you do not actually know there are not 2 decimals actually what we are doing for rounding is $99.66 because that 5 becomes a 6 on 2 things and then we are going to go back to our seats
number one we are at best buy so these 4 people can afford i can wait
so the 4 people who could afford the ipod for them buying this as a group each person would only have to pay $99.65 66 for the ipod that okay make an arrangement to figure out who is going to buy i am sorry the iphone brought up a question
something one way to mentally check this is you know this number times this number equals our dividend if this were 900 and something which that makes sense 900 and something times 4 equals 380
because i thought when we were working on prices is what would happen is that is okay
finish you could only have 2 past the decimal point for the prices that is usually and then you can only have 2 numbers past the prices and that would be 996.65 no this number after the decimal point can go on as long as you want as long as you know this is partly what set the scene that you can round up
i wanted to do this all the way to the end because i knew it would be an even number over here and not have a remainder or fraction this would be ¢66 not an even number meaning that you do not have a remainder any questions about what we just did here in dividing a number that has a decimal point
that is partly true because when you subtract 36 you are going to get another 30 but what is after that digit is going to give you a pattern we are going to move on on how did you get this
we just continued the process remember we started all over again so here when we add 26 we asked how many 4s were in 26 and we got 6 started it is really repetitive once you get these 3 steps down you are going to be repeating them until you get 0 down here or a remainder question about this
otherwise you can ask me a little bit later it is mainly about why do they call it rounding that has nothing to do right now particularly with how we got this
yes i think you could do 2 of the people paying $99.66 and 2 of the people paying $99.65
be quiet and go back to our desks one 2 3
so what we are going to do right now is use our folders to go over some review questions
we are going to answer the questions at our table i am going to tell you guys it is not going to be a game where there is a winner or we keep score
correct part of the questions will involve our recap of dividing decimals i can wait
our review of dividing using decimals and multiplying using decimals where we have a whole number as a multiplier just as we add one whole number to 4 with our divisor do you want to pass out the whiteboards for us
now i had 2 people earlier today who were excellent examples of our class and
these are all the people who are starting to ignore our 3 2 one chant and i am very serious about the 3 2 one we started to move away from all the other discipline things we have been working on but this is our call to get back on track with everything right now
when i get to one that means you are focused up here and you are no longer moving your mouths
otherwise i do not want to hear it and i do not want anyone else up getting a marker raise your hand if the marker is not doing what you need it to do yes so let us see who is going to be going 1st for us
can you i am going to put up a problem problems we are going clockwise yes
it is a game but we are not keeping score
3 of the pillows are round and 5 are square
number 2 the other change is i am going to call the person to come up and explain rather than the group doing it you guys are ready and let us have come up for the group
what is the answer and explain i like the way that the leopard champions are focused up here
i am not too happy with the jaguars right now okay so the answer is 5 eighths would you raise your hand if you got 5 eighths hands down
off how many of you are not sure how he came up with 5 eighths good
represent the total number of pillows jaguars up here
i am listening you are not looking though 8 represents the total number of pillows this is a probability problem the 5 represents what
so the number of square pillows so 5 eighths would be the probability of getting 5 if this were set up as a probability problem earlier that is correct thank you
that was a good job
so i am going to ask you guys to make this assumption
whatever is on the board might be a little off with your pictures but there is equal spacing in between all of these just make that assumption what number is represented by i can wait
what number is represented by point z on the number line i will give you guys one minute to do that it put it back you are going to be doing this problem as well
i can take a point back whatever you think team i am going to choose who is going to explain it
remember if they do not get it right then we will go over to the next table to come up with the right answer can we have with this one come up
how many of you got 2 and 14th as your answer raise your hand if you did how many of you think there is another answer to this problem that she is wrong we only have one person
wrong how many of you are not quite sure what the answer is answer can you explain to us how you got it
okay we have to go on you get partial credit have a seat remember guys this is my way to know i am talking this is my way to know who is understanding what you are doing and how many of you are just listening to an answer
different it is also helping me to determine for this period who is actually understanding what they are doing and who is not so we have a let us see
for you that means a call is going home it has nothing to do with the team what said here is she got her whole number by looking at the number line
our z is all the way over here so how many whole numbers are past until you get to the whole number one 2 then what she did is she saw one slash mark here represents one quarter one more time and you are going to get sent home and i am going to be calling at least 2 parents today
if these are broken up into 4 equal parts each part has to be a quarter answer hold on for a 2nd she used a mixed number
can you also give us what this would be in decimals what is 2 and 14th equivalent to in decimals if the 2 is a whole it would be before the decimal point yes it would be
then 14th is it 25 yes there are some fractions that you guys really just memorized to know automatically what their decimal is we know you can use long division to come up with it that way
all i did was i thought about what goes into 100 4 times and then what is one of them so we can count by 25
100 if it was 14th it would be 25 50 good excellent you guys can also start to memorize 14th is always equivalent to 0.25 and as mentioned one half is always equal to 0.503 fourths is always equal to 0.75
that way you do not have to do long division and you do not even have to break them up as she is saying
i am going to move on because it is time to move on but i am glad you brought up the point though so you were i think looking in the right direction what 4 times 2 is 9
8 then you add the numerator of the fraction and that is how you get the 9 and you are correct that is how you get that
so now we are just going to worry about getting the questions correct and explaining them we are not going to make it into a winner loser situation
that means you guys are going to be more positive when someone does something great because you guys were not doing that for a while congratulating each other when you start back to doing that then i know you respect each other when we start to do other things and no one is saying he did this and you did not say that about him then i will know you are ready to be more of a sport
i will know immediately when things have changed okay
okay time is up
so we are going to have
everybody may not know how they got the answer but that is the purpose of discussion at the table so that at some point if you did not know what the answer is or you know what the answer is and maybe someone at your table has explained it and you understand it you can come up here do not be discouraged if you do not understand it immediately
you guys have a chance to steal yes you do you raise your hand if you have a question can you raise your hand
do you want to try it
rule i am not quite sure why you are doing that it
hold on a 2nd if i hear one more disruption from someone in this group i am going to call out the person and you are going to be over there isolated
you are not going to be participating and you are going to be getting a 0 for class participation stop the talking and if you see someone breaking the rule ignore them because i will catch them me just ignore them and i will find the person breaking the rule sorry
so you are saying one divided by 7 is equal to 10 2 divided by 7 is equal to 17 that rule does not work so you know that is the wrong answer that is okay you tried remember the rule was to work for each line
so now let us see if the blue wolves can come up and help us
3 2 one if you feel like they are not listening to you respecting you they are trying to say that they are trying to help me and they are not
they did not even say one thing to help me it is a group effort i like what is doing talk she will be the last person to speak before we move on okay one is over there drawing random things on her board when we are saying come on can you help us
us i erased it and then i tried to help you do not need to raise your voice little girl neither one of you need to talk like that
up would you both step outside
i will call you back in when you are ready and you have cooled down you stand outside the door and you stand by the locker
just tell us what it is it this group says if we multiply the input by 7 and we add 3 to whatever that number is then we get the output number how many agree with that
hand you can leave it there if you multiply the input number by 7 and whatever that number product is you add 3 to it then you are going to get the output number
that hands down sure good job guys
that is the answer what was that i kind of explained but go ahead which one was that one okay
others remember guys just because you detect one answer here that is not a pattern input output is a pattern he started with 5 and then tested it with all the others and it is true
point whose turn is it
yes it was over here that they got it wrong remember they got it wrong
that was their original turn and they got it wrong we did not get a turn
i want to see if all of you can do all of the problems we are making a game of it but still it is on each of you to work out the problem because i will know if you know based on if i see the problem
do not say anything more about
okay this afternoon we re going to be doing a lesson on ractions teacher fractions percent equivalents and we ve been working on this and let s see if i just say to you i m going to give you a percent and i want to see if you can give me the equivalent fraction can let s see if you remember some of them some of them are tough as you know the eighths and the sixths we ve been working on that
okay now how about 75% what would be the fraction equivalent of that k student teacher 68s multiple students teacher shh shh raise your hand please 3 fourths it would be equivalent to what fraction
here s 2 of them teacher 3 fourths would be equivalent to 70 so they d be worth the same okay so what we re going to be doing is comparing percents fractions i got a tricky one for you though cause this is one that some of you get a little bit mixed up on the 18th what would the percent be for 18th what would the percent be welve and a half percent teacher 12.5% good
and then how about 16th student teacher what is it right how about 5 tenths student teacher
okay so we re going to look at the objective up here and we are going to be identifying fraction and percent equivalents through reasoning about representations and known equivalents and relationships and then we re going to play the in between game but before we play it we are going to have somebody demonstrate 2 students demonstrate playing it so we re all going to watch cause i want to make sure that everybody knows how to play the game
okay so the 1st thing that we re going to take out would be our little fraction cards do you have your fraction cards the yellow everybody s got them hopefully i thought that maybe we d use the whole pack but i don t think we will today because some of them on here are the numerator s bigger than the denominator
okay so if you would just take out the cards with the diamonds and you re going to play with a partner and we re going to be seeing how well you know your percents and your fraction equivalents
me an we choose our own partners teacher 1st we re going to do a demonstration and then we re going to all i don t know before we were doing all right with the partners that we chose before you want to maybe mix it up a little bit
okay so what i d like you to do is 1st take out all of your little fraction cards and you see the diamond on the side just the diamond ones and then put the other ones in a safe place for later on when we talk about improper fractions when the numerator is bigger than the denominator yet so just take out the cards with the little diamond on the side cards okay
everybody s got them hopefully okay left mine at home teacher okay right now in addition to having 2 of you play you really need one deck of cards correct so now take out if you would the rules for the game
you ve got the rules for the in between game that i gave you last week when we were working on it 0 we got to go in between teacher and if you have the rules you might also have please sit down pleas sit down student teacher please sit down please sit down
you may also have your percent equivalent strip too that we worked on and we were right in the fractions right below the percents you may have that also or you might have this one also
that s if you don t know them still you know some of you may very well know them so anyhow and the in between if you don t have the rules to the game it s in your math handbook okay you have that so if you don t have the rules but i think most of you know how to kinda have a clue as to we re going to do a demonstration on it anyway okay so everybody s got all of those papers out
what we will also need would be just a piece of scrap paper so that we re going to play 5 rounds of this game okay and whoever who s going to win the game me teacher when somebody ot the lowest teacher right has the lowest number right when somebody has the lowest number they will be the ones that win
need i can you pass out a small piece of math paper to everybody so we ll use this to you know mark rounds one round 2 rounds 3 rounds 4 rounds and 5 rounds and whoever wins is the winner
rounds teacher we re going to play 5 rounds yeah okay so 1st though i think before we even do anything what i d like to do is have a little demonstration just to be sure that people remember me he cards teacher is somebody s initials on that 0
no don t think it s mine teacher well there should be initials on the back no okay eah i put all my initials teacher okay what we re going to you might have an extra piece of scrap paper
that s okay but i think 1st of all we re going to have i don t know who owns it anyway and play a demonstration game for us
okay so what we re going to do just for a couple of minutes is we re going to review playing the game to make sure everybody knows what to do if you don t have the rules to the in between game you need to take it out okay and that student teacher excuse me student teacher no everybody can just have one and they could just you know go with wit with another person whoever we re going to play with
d i would like all of you kind of move your desks over so we can bring up here and then can come up you don t need to move too far just so we have enough room to kinda stand around them as we put their desks in the middle please move over so i want to bring s desk up here
student teacher huh hy can t we just use everybody else teacher well he s right here too so that s fine student teacher excuse me student teacher want to come up please and bring a chair up please and just come right here and then we re just going to stand
just bring a chair honorable you don t need to bring the desk okay okay good come on up all right now the rest of you students all of us we re going to be so good at this
0 student teacher come over here please and please come on up okay so come on over everybody come on over teacher and especially if some of you don t remember so the very i would need everybody standing up so everybody can see what s going on with these kids
okay so we are on round number one so could you please write round one on your paper anywhere and then put a and then d so we re going to see we re going to do the 1st round okay i need you too honey okay
so we re going to do round one and whoever gets the lowest score after all 5 rounds will be a winner and i think since you did such a good job on friday since i m bringing you in something tomorrow that maybe some of the winners today won the spelling bee so you re going to get something else and then maybe the winners of this so come on over honey come on over and watch
okay so let s explain so the very 1st thing that we do what do we do here a huffle the cards teacher we shuffle the cards just the ones with the diamonds on them right and then in the middle of the desk what are we putting down are we putting down fractions or percents multiple students percents teacher percents we put 10% over here 50% in the middle and 90% over here
1st of all who can tell me 10% stands for what fraction who can tell me j enth teacher 110th 50% stands for what please 50% stands for ne half teacher one half and 90% stands for ine tenths teacher 9 tenths very good okay so 1st of all we put those out right
and then the next thing we re going to do is we shuffle the cards around and you all how much is each person going to get cards ix okay so now you re going to take turns placing the card so that it touches another card like this
you also can put an equivalent what does equivalent mean same teacher the same equivalent fraction right up above the percent okay so the object of the game is to see how many cards you are going to place
okay now as you put the card down if you get one close to any of the percents that are down here you are going to say what the fraction is and its equivalent okay i don t know i don t know if we were doing that last time okay take one of your cards out and then you have to state the fraction and the percent equivalent
ne 10 and 10% teacher 110th is 10% equal to good your turn student 33 and a 3rd teacher and a 3rd what s the other word percent student percent teacher percent 33 and a 3rd percent now notice no one can take a card and stick it now in between these 2 cause they re touching
ahead ne forth 25% teacher very good next one ne half 50% teacher very good hree tenths 30% teacher very good you watching girls doing and the winners will get a little something tomorrow
hree fifths 60% teacher 3 fifths 60% ine tenths 90% teacher excellent excellent any more wo thirds 66 and a 2 thirds teacher per ent teacher very good okay our fifths 80% teacher okay
an t do any more teacher can t do any more even tenths teacher okay good excuse me okay 7 tenths stands for 70% d student teacher s done he s got what have you got left
left hree 8s and teacher 38s and 18th what would 38s stand for in percent student 37 and a half teacher 37 and a half percent could we put it in here anywhere multiple students teacher could we put it in here no we couldn t and then we have 18th what would 18th stand for multiple students 12.5 teacher 12.5%
here it would go right here but once these cards are touching you can t put anything in between round so how many cards do you have left
initial and has ero teacher 0 so who won the 1st round b ecause he had less cards teacher he had less cards he actually didn t have any did he
honey don t want to play teacher okay okay so now we re on round 2 and after 5 rounds whoever has the lowest amount are they the winner are they the winner multiple students yes teacher okay okay good so you know the whole object of this game is called in between which means once the cards are touching you can t put anything in between them
okay student teacher that s why they re called in between so then after we do the diamond ones then we re going to learn about improper fractions where the numerator is bigger than the denominator and then we ll be able to play with that too there teacher what did they put down there multiple students teacher what did they put down there what s the 1st thing that they did
what did they put down hey put the fractions teacher they put the fractions down the 10% the 50% and the 90% okay good ne 10 and that s 10% teacher excellent wo 5th is 40% ine tenths 90% teacher good
ne 6 16 and a 3rd teacher 16 what nd a 3rd teacher and a 3rd wo thirds teacher 2 thirds percent that s a tricky one
good hree fourths 75% teacher very good and remember you have to state the fraction and the percent when you do it okay go ahead hree 10s 30% teacher okay go ahead that s a tricky one huh yeah let s see if someone can help him if he can t get it
show it up hold it up to the rest of the kids and see if anybody hold it up what is the fraction multiple students teacher 56 what percent would that be 56 student 86 and a 3rd teacher 86 and a 3rd 0 83 and a 3rd teacher 83 and a 3rd percent there no cause we ve got 75% here and then 90% so we couldn t put that in between no teacher what s that what percent is that
58s student 62 and a half percent teacher 62 and a half percent is that correct hum student teacher okay an t put it in left multiple students 2 teacher 2 okay put down 2 and ne teacher one
okay so why don t you finish playing the rounds okay 5 rounds and then i ll put people in partners and then we can switch around a little bit today okay but you really really need to know how to play now multiple students yes teacher is there anybody that still might have difficulty playing with this
and some of you still don t know the equivalent percent in fractions so that s why it s a good idea to keep that paper out to help you so that you learn them cause i will be giving you quizzes on this so that you know them perfectly some of you still don t know even your multiplication facts as yet so that needs to be you know you need to be studying that too cause last time what did we have 5 100s on that i think or 6 so we ll be ready for that okay
see is there anybody here that would like to choose somebody rather than me doing it and everybody s going to have to play today okay so let us see who would you like to play with today a okay so just needs to move a chair over next to you and you just need one deck of cards and the piece of paper okay then pull your chair over to student s desk
multiple students teacher do you guys want to do you want to finish this out or do you want to choose somebody else to play with hoose somebody else teacher huh you want to choose somebody else those ine teacher all right so why don t you put those away honey then we ll just stop this demonstration you did a great job you 2 really know really know you percents and fractions
okay so who would you like to student teacher jesus okay so want to pull your chair up okay so bring your cards out and make sure you ve got the rules okay and pull your chair up next to him
who do you want to student teacher who
me student teacher you see if he s got the game now so maybe you can go bring your chair over to everybody s got to be picked as long as you re playing and not fooling around okay
over what about you student teacher i have s book too book all right so who do you want to play with honey student teacher k student teacher okay
floor and you have nobody okay please bring your chair over there or you know what want to bring maybe s chair over here next cause student teacher your chair isn t the chair
and then we have what 0 picked you did you pick multiple students teacher did she pick you student teacher did you
b you know a lot of students would say 0 no no no and you just did a really nice show of kindness today job so now look at how nicely she did that whine multiple students teacher okay so would you and play please thank you
do you want to come up next to up here and we have you do you want to just be like watching the 2 to make sure they re doing the right student teacher make sure that he s saying the right fraction and the percent am that make sure you re saying the right percent and the right fraction okay student teacher would you like to sit and observe and then maybe after 5 rounds are done then you can go in for somebody
with student teacher who student s okay so let me ask you a question hat teacher since we have a couple of kids out student teacher no i want you to do 5 rounds and then would one of you play the 5 rounds with him student teacher yeah but you finish your round out okay
and you can maybe just pull a chair over and watch while they re playing and then one of you will play some with him okay cause he doesn t have anybody cause we re missing some students today okay good so honey did you want to go hat time is it chair and bring it over and you can just watch them here who won the 0 we didn t finish
okay now remember that you say the fraction and the percent okay right multiple students teacher okay
let s see how you re doing student teacher 0 you didn t get a piece of scrap paper to write down okay put your round one and then put your initials and then see e can t go anymore teacher you can t go 0 you both ahead round one student teacher excellent excellent who are you playing with
student teacher huh student teacher what s he doing e got a tie on the 1st one teacher so did you do round one continue i want to hear everybody saying the fraction and the percent please okay
it multiple students teacher okay make sure your partner is saying the fraction and the percent also okay student teacher how you doing e got a tie in the 1st round teacher you tied 0 wow he s giving you a run for your money isn t he
student teacher run for your money what does that mean he s giving you if i said he s giving you is giving you a run for your money what does that mean competition yeah good competition cause you both tied the 1st one
okay let s go see what everybody else is doing multiple students teacher is he shuffling them right okay
won teacher did you put you need to put your numbers down on the paper honey okay okay multiple students teacher let s see
right so put round one your 2 initials and then 2 and 2 right again student teacher whoever gets after the 5 rounds whoever gets the lowest score the lowest number is the winner
student multiple students teacher well you re going to get all these numbers at the end on how many cards you can place and can t place and whatever you can t place will be your number and then we add them all up okay at the end and whoever gets the lowest number is the winner of the round of the whole the whole 5 rounds actually okay
student teacher and so are you don t with the 1st round you re now starting your 2nd round right good how we doing ot good
this is this s desk student teacher well don t keep doing it honey please okay cause it we need to get it fixed so what was your number what was your score on had teacher you need to put the numbers down there what s the number ero teacher 0 and what okay
so then shuffle them how we doing round one yeah student teacher so you got 2 and you got 0

5 what multiple students teacher the other 10 student teacher cameras are rolling eah but teacher pardon me 0 teacher they don t they don t sit in and watch it
university they take it back to harvard and they take a look at it and they show other teachers so they can show other teachers multiple students teacher you need to behave properly please all right student teacher he doesn t cheat e can see my cards teacher m serious he went like that and put it down teacher yeah but you know what
student teacher he s got to know where to put it and you ve got to be saying the fraction and the student teacher who won the 1st round student teacher 0 what s she got a 2 you got a student teacher you got a 0 okay okay
fractions are they kinda sinking in a little bit now eah teacher after playing this game you ll know them better i know you will 13rd is equal to student teacher what is it equal student teacher percent right
okay even tenths teacher shh
here do you know your fractions and your equivalent percents now student teacher well you ve got got 78th and 2 teacher all right let me ask you something what percent does that stand for student 87 and a half percent teacher and then what does this one stand for
student 16 and a half percent i mean yeah and 28s percent teacher okay so he s got one you got one left eah teacher and you have 2 left eah okay how many what does this stand for
good okay and you can t student teacher you can t put it in anywhere can you 2 win teacher so he got a 0 right eah 0 teacher okay
so mix them up again mix them up again student teacher yeah okay okay make sure you re saying it
58s equals what percent student teacher 62 and half student teacher 62 and what student 62 and a half percent teacher you ve got to be learning these okay
for what percent student ne 3rd teacher who can tell me what 3 eighths stands for in percent it student teacher 37 and a half percent
student teacher 5 eighths ive 8s teacher 5 eighths stop laughing please there s nothing to laugh at student 62 and a half percent teacher 62 and a half percent what does that say student 62 teacher okay okay multiple students teacher what round are you guys on
student teacher you all done 0 referee got 0 in the 2 rounds nd he s got 2 teacher wow keep going keep going doing a good job

here how many do you have ne teacher yours was student teacher okay mix them up
okay mix them up real good so what happened student teacher so you know all of your fractions and all the equivalent percents student teacher yeah i know know a lot of them but not teacher yeah you probably don t know the sixths and the eighths eah that s teacher and the tough ones
right okay so guess what you know and you always get 100 on your multiplication student student multiplication is teacher i know 0 but do you know what this just know all these every single one of them teacher 0 well you know well you were a winner today with the spelling so you did well and you get a special treat
student teacher no one with the spelling and one for doing a good job on friday 0 but you told me instead of one remember teacher i said did i say 2 ou said 2 instead of one cause i got all of them right teacher we ll see what i can bring in tomorrow

i m waiting for you
guys could you please come over here those of you that did not participate appropriately will not be able to participate in the movie and popcorn this afternoon and i have a whole box of microwave popcorn for you guys so let s work on it
i m going to ask you to leave if you can t be appropriate can i leave if you do you don t watch the movie deal we re going to do something really similar to what we did the other day we talked about different types of graphs and types of questions that graphs can answer correct
yes we talked about different questions graphs can answer can i move up yes give me an example of a question that graphs can answer for us
r there was the temperature was 60 degrees what s the question next what was the temperature on friday so if we have a graph that takes data and shows us what the temperature was every day for a week we can figure out what the temperature was on friday
job what else can a graph answer how many sneakers did the people sell how many sneakers did a particular store sell on a particular day right d how many people went to the store you can take data on how many people went into the store each day and then you can graph it
v how many tigers were seen at the zoo that day we could add how many tigers how many elephants how many lions how many dwarf alligators so there s all sorts of questions a graph can answer right what kind of data can we use on a graph
numbers okay on different subjects how many different subjects you think
time water only in this classroom i ll remember that so you won t have to have any out what was your answer sorry i ve got nothing on how many do you think there s a few things we can take data on
lot like how fast does the car go we yes we could take data on what color shirt everybody s wearing today sandwich we can take data on how many inches of rain we had in a month we can take data on just about anything right
correct so there s lots of uses for graphs because we can take data on lots of things right butterflies there s lots of different things we can take data on butterflies right we could take data on how many caterpillars make it to adult butterflies
we can take data on the different species found in an area right we could take data on a lot of things graphs are a big part of life for us right again it s almost like you can take data on anything
again something that answers questions remember we said it had to do with data right we said it what it puts data in correct order
right so graphs visually represent data so we can look at it so we can see yes instead of just a list of data that data starts to mean something when we can look at the data and make decisions and answer questions and draw conclusions based on what that data says
now we talked about 2 different types of graphs already right
them when does it make sense to do a line graph wait a 2nd you can be next number lines like it s counting up to which one it is we talked a little bit about line graphs having to do with numbers changing over time right
we talked about distance and time as being easy to represent and understand on a line graph right doesn t mean you can t do distance and time on a bar graph but a lot of times a line graph makes sense because we can see the change over time right
well now when is it most likely that we would use a bar graph
v when would we use a bar graph
right we just would more commonly see a bar graph to represent that today what we re going to do this is your final exam when it comes to line graphs and bar graphs just kidding it s not that important data your data can be about anything
you re going to create a graph a line graph or bar graph that represents that data number one you can do both for extra credit you re going to create a data set okay
number 2 you re going to make a graph representing your data right i m going to give you a big reminder here
label that means label both of your axes give them names tell me what you re talking about and give a title that explains what the graph is if it s the most popular pet it should say that at the top so i know what it s about someone should be able to look at your graph and figure out what it means so you want to give them labels that help them understand what your data means
read number 2 to me we are absolutely going to do this
day make your graph make sure you label it then write 3 questions that can be answered by your graph key at least one of your questions must begin with either how many more or how many less
we re going to practice making comparisons today with our graph with our questions i should say you can do that but one of your questions has to start with how many more so how many more people liked dogs better than cats
fewer okay so how many more or how many fewer we re going to make comparisons between 2 different things in our graph okay
sense i m going to give you graph paper to make your data and lined paper to write your questions
on i will answer questions in a minute right start by creating your set of data i want to check your data before you move on to create your graph
data you have to tell me at the top of this what your data is is that s why we re here to learn no make the data 1st
data thanks pencil ms yes where s
is busy yes fine bring your pencil
yes in fact yes no can you pick one please how about green
you we re all set
well bring a chair and come sit here okay so i will do the writing for you but you re going to make up the data
them i will write them for you all right what would you like to take data on
data nice working together excellent okay
i already did that one okay so could we do different types of pie know got you
i was going to do fruit pies we can do fruit pies
you you can do fruit pies let me just check outside no you don t need to check outside
you have 6 flags kennedy lake
you said cocoa keys yeah we have up in new hampshire yeah i did too
yes very good here s the graph guys come on
tv nice remember straight lines
how about we use numbers like percentages might be harder job i like how you used tally marks and remembered to make a 5 with the tally marks
water it s called water world no it s not water world what s the water park in new hampshire called that s it
you nice what kind of graph are you going to make line graph excellent that s 5 you we re pretending you took a survey
best 10 2 so i think 6 flags is your favorite you know which one is my favorite water world
country 0 yeah water country so what is the name of our graph parks can i get a ruler yep
data now it s time to make a graph you got it listen i will help you make your lines straight then i want you to set up the intervals okay what kind of graph are you going to make what do you mean bar graph okay
i don t know how to do line graphs i ll show you one i m going to show you after i was doing a bar graph then they were showing how to do a line graph when i got there they were already done
i won t show you for this because you want to do a bar graph for this but after i m going to make a line graph all right good job can i go outside where that table is like last time that s fine if you need space go have it
here all right up so will i
me i love how you already wrote the title here okay favorite sports
you need to just add a little 0 here you won t be able to do it without your data
here s 0 c c e r so how many people like football best
fine i like that you re taking tally marks too
it i like how you did your lines straight this time
though you need to label your axes though what s this and what s this what i will label one for you then you can label the other
what is your graph you people s favorite minecraft characters
steve 0 has to be right here then this one of your favorite characters is zombie
we want to stay away from doing one of my favorite character for right now
bit yeah can we say that 0 people think steve is the best that one person thinks zombie is the best 5 people think creeper is the best this is my favorite right but what we re trying to do is represent something clearly without getting into percentages because you don t have 100% on here
confused so if we said number of people that like those best okay then this is the character okay now it s labeled and the title would be what
favorite minecraft characters
all right i m just going to help you here for a 2nd you did this right the way you have it in the pane here what you want to do if you want this to be 0 you have to go right on the line
does that make sense there you have 9 5 one and 0
lines can you put these in for me so it s easier for me to read pencil can you pick it up for me please i like how you re using an interval that s different than one 2 that shows me it s over there
wow thanks this one here will be water country
i didn t spell country the right way that s fine okay ways okay
set let s see okay i need you to label this axis so you know what they are and i need you to give it a title
data you made a graph representing the data you you can take a piece of lined paper want i m going over there this afternoon yeah whoa
i love this job do me a favor in the future though when you do the degrees instead of putting it on the middle put it right in the line you can put sunday right here monday right here
perfect nice job okay measuring temperature each day for a week
that s close now you re going to write 3 questions okay that can be answered by that graph
now i can t believe he s only in 3rd grade what are these all here just put sports it s even in color
sports what s this labeled sports exactly there nice job
labeled just label this then you can do the 3 questions
just label sports at the bottom like we said then you need to write 3 questions
this numbers number of people and what is this places place okay and what are we going to call the graph
favorite amusement parks can i take a break i tell you what you write one question that can be answered by this graph and then you can take a break so what question could you answer from the graph
football looking at the graph what can you tell about football it s how many else what sport was most popular
football so the one question you can ask is which sport is most popular okay
d 3 questions that can be answered by that graph d we want to start one of the questions with the least popular right what is the least popular sport
question what is the least popular sport
sport question mark okay then the last question you want to ask is how many more or how many less way okay
questions i need you to do one that starts with how many more or how many less what okay how many more people like creeper than zombie
yes and these are excellent questions questions one of the things we said is one of the questions had to start with either how many more or how many less
comparisons it s okay
relax how many more m 0 r e say how many more of one of these than another
how many more creeper than zombie job how many more people liked creeper than zombie
90% then perfect
them excellent put it in work completed for me please job listen breath if you d like me to help you write then i will
come on
too take hers and keep working with them i have to go finish make sure both of them are complete good morning take these down to the office not yet
yet we will take em down at lunchtime put it on your desk i know this one is for today so yeah
it is crazy i mean the teachers and i mean i have never experienced this before in the school system
and this is my 3rd year and it has been and it is like but the other teachers say like the specialists are supposed to work with certain kids i will get an e mail like yesterday i am no longer coming in on monday but then the special ed teacher she is trying to do her data now and i am like i have to do that too
time it is just too it is like and when you talk about it at the meetings it is like you are the it is like you get the finger pointing
you know what i mean might as well not say anything cause they are going to certainly come back at you with but it is just frustrating and then it is like once we get rolling we get rolling but it is just getting to that point
get your jackets off girls and go to your math group and enough now get your chair
e downstairs did you is the meeting today 3 0 3 0 that is right you have to keep telling me that she said she will be in today
24 can i we are going to do 19 through 221st 19 through 22 we stopped at 18 right so we are going to go to the next page from yesterday right you did not take yours to your seat did you
we did not go over that one
one pass that right there i have your other one but i do not have the i got that is okay 19 through 22 then we are working together
paper i want you to use the scrap paper to find your answer yeah i do not want you to use all your paper though we are doing 19 through 24
d get busy busy busy remember to use your numbers your timeline if you have to
some of them we you can just add the minutes
stop and what would i tell you
we will get to that when we huh we will get to that later
b she might be thank you she may be at a meeting right your group is working with the time huh your group is working with time do not turn it on
have you finished have you finished 19 to 22
stop i want to go back to number 17 cause i was moving so fast yesterday and i wanted to go back to that one cause our time was wrong somewhere i did not count the hours and i just want to redo it for you off what i have done i have put ticks up here to count for each hour
t so we leaving from washington and we are going to cut we want to get to florida jacksonville florida
l we will start at 9 30 and i am going to just count 23 hours 12 30 when i hit 12 30 it changes to pm right yes and then it is this is 12 30 again so we are back to the daytime
8 30 it was 8 30 and then another 20 minutes added onto that the time would have what 8 50 8 50 what am or pm am yay i got it right i was zooming through that and that should not happen number 16 and number 20 let us look at number 191st good
let us look at number 191st and then we will get to 20 m arrived home from the dentist at 2 0 pm she drove for 46 minutes before getting home
what time did she leave the doctor is office so for this time do you go forward or backwards 2 5 so she arrived home at 2 5 am or pm
home and you have to write this down so your brain can start thinking about what is the question asking she arrived home at 2 5 pm from the dinners she drove for 46 minutes before getting home
what time did she leave the doctor is office she left at 2 51 because all you have to do is add 46 +5 and that gets you 51
that yes does it ask how long it took her to get home or what time did she leave the doctor is office what time did she leave what time did she leave the doctor is office say she arrived home at 2 5 they want to know what time did she leave to get back at home at 2 5
this is what this time should be looking like you do not have a start time we usually work with a start time they have given you your end time which was 2 5 cause that is what time she got home they want to know what time she 0 you subtract so you got to do what subtract so now tell me what time it was when she got home
2 41
teacher do you want them to have this yeah cause miss e should be coming in but i do not know where she is
k so i got 2 41 how did you get 2 41 and what did you get
on come on come on if you go back if you start at 2 5 and you go back how many minutes no
let us subtract wait a minute listen get this one you can put it right there i did not do that 0 i got one 59
i got i subtract one more so i got 12 59
one 59 what do you subtract you subtracted how what time did she get home then that is still not telling me what time she got home it is too
one 59 that is what i got one 59 i got a different answer what would you get
one 10 cause you can not subtract 6 from 5 so i crossed it out one i made the 0 a 10 crossed out the 10 made it a 9
up let us look at this again let us look at it again let us do a timeline we will do another timeline 2 5 let me read it again time 12nd she drove for 46 minutes before getting home
office so we got to take it how much 46 minutes 46 minutes if we take back 46 minutes how much are we going to get one 59 is that correct it is 2 5
no 6 minutes cause that is just 6 minutes so what do you need to do huh come on let us talk together let us get it together minutes if we said one 59 is that 46 minutes how many minutes is that
6 that is only 6 minutes 0 it is one 19 one 19 it is one 19
0 i see 46 minutes you subtract 4 4 from what subtract 4 from 2 5 pm 0 is says it is taking her 46 minutes to get back home
backwards we have to go backwards 46 minutes i am just going to put ticks here so we can see the timelines that is a lot of time
now even if we counted back like that 2 5 this would be what be let us use chunks let me go back chunks we are going to say we will do 20 minute intervals 20 20 20 minutes this is 46 minutes so it is 5 and a one
right so 20 minute 2 5 -20 minutes is how much 2 5 -20 minutes which would give me what what time
2 20 how much does it give me 2 15 and you add and then we are going to go back another 20 minutes 2 15 another 20 minutes one 59 which would be what would it which will be what time
2 35 and what did we say this was 15 minutes yeah 15 minutes one 35 -15 minutes is how much 0 10 one 20 one 20 and then the one minute one 19
one 19 right back to the same thing which she said minutes we use chunks of minutes chunks of minutes let me show it one more time backwards we are starting at 2 5 pm
chunks i am going to use 20 minute intervals and then 15 minutes cause that is going to give me because it is 46 minutes because it is 46 minutes she drove for 46 minutes before she got home
home but 20 +20 +15 is 20 +20 is how much 0 i see what i am wrong i am wrong i am wrong 5 is 45 i am sorry speeding again minutes you are right anyway so now what i have to do is to subtract those numbers to get a time
subtract those numbers to get a time cause on this this is my 46 minutes that i got to go back to see what my starting time was when i left the doctor is office so if i add if i subtract 2 5 -20 what am i going to get
be 175 so what time is that why do not you write it down write it down
what is stop guessing and write it down 2 15 then i am going to take 2 15 and subtract what from it minutes and what do i have that is going to be 295
what that is going to be 295 295 i mean 195
2 35 but at 1st you said it was one 35 2 35 if we have 2 15 we are subtracting 20 minutes from it
on this is 9 this makes this a one right 2 35 why cause you can not what did i get what that is 2 35
we are done but you need to it is 2 35 yes no it is one 35
20 read number 20 for me so do we have to go backwards again yes cause this she finished her project at 4 15
4 15 pm time 45 minutes part 2 took how many minutes 36 part 3 took how many minutes 14 say what was your answer i got 3 20
answer number 20 l did it on a piece of paper let us do it
it these are your times listen this is science projects in 3 parts minutes the 3rd part took 14 minutes if she finishes now she is finishing at 4 15 start so we got to go back to these times all of it put together is 95 minutes huh
if you add them all together it is how many minutes it is 95 minutes but then you but then what are you going to do with the 95 minutes i want all of you to use this and give me an answer 1st answer all together these minutes write it down write it down i want to see work how you did 95 work read what it says if she finishes they want to know what time she started
she write like said 5 5 you just stopped here 0 what time was the start time
time so it is going to be subtraction what time did she start i got one 4
up answer was even if you did not know other thing the same answer i got one 39
what would this be as the hours if i am doing if this is 95 minutes how many hours is this one hour and what minutes i got so what am i going to do with this one hour and 35 minutes subtract it from 4 15 it you are not adding it because you want to know your start time
3 20 i got one 20 start i got 3 20 3 30 where you all getting this 30 from like that is what i want to know i got 2 20
much 00 can i subtract one from 3 4 and you got a borrower and what do i do 3 20 make that a 3 now what is 11 -3 8 and what is 3 -one 2 subtract 6 so now what is the time
2 20 i mean i got it right is that my start time 3 20 because if you take away and then you got 20 left over from the 80
i got 2 20 because another 2 that added another one over 20 minutes left over this wait did not we do this for a test
part of it we did speaking of tests did you check all the tests we are going to do that together where we do start on this one
me let us look at number 6 6 read what it says practiced shooting balls for basketball after dinner
he began at stopped practicing at 8 10 pm how long did practice wait a minute wait a minute wait wait wait read it again
practiced shooting goals for basketball after dinner he began at stopped practicing at 8 10 pm how long did practice this is our start time
time so how many said a did you did them and now we are working them how many said a d so we have 2 different times
if we started at 7 15 can we go to 8 15 no we can not count the hour because that would take us over minutes so if we had 7 15 how many minutes can we use minutes what is the largest we could use let us say 30 minutes so 7 15 +30 minutes us what
7 45 we got another 15 we can add 15 minutes that is 8 0 this you did not put 0 wait never mind and then 10 minutes so we have added 30 minutes 15 minutes and 10 minutes wow so what so at this time it was 8 0
when we added 45 minutes gave us 8 0 55 55 minutes 30 minutes +15 minutes +5 minutes is 55 i am sorry 10 minutes gives 55 minutes
hours 55 minutes 3 +2 is 5 55 minutes number 7
wait a minute let us look at this
it scrap paper we need timelines i want everyone to do it again cause we have 2 different answers so just do it over again to make sure
teacher did you do it again
up wait are we finished no you did not see those papers yesterday did you no i 0 do you mind if i look i did not rifle without
the math sheets from yesterday yeah
there good do you want me to put them on your sheets good good out of the whole thing that is good
we ready
you ready yeah how many said a this time
we are on number 7 right yes how many said b how many said c
i said b too
i thought it how many said c c is that a hand right let us look at it
it we trying to get from 5 45 pm to 8 21st 5 45 6 45 can i go to 7 45 7 45 how many minutes
15 so i add 15 8 0 and how many more minutes do i need be 2 hours and what b
be 2 hours and 17 minutes 2 hours and 17 minutes that was my 1st answer you guys do number 8 hmmm yeah let us do number 8
8 how many said a for number 8 b how many said c a how many said d
say you are here too i began each tuesday evening at just say the time 6 10 am or pm
pm around 7 37 pm is finished with his lesson how much time has what is that word elapsed elapsed so what is the start time 6 10 6 10 am or pm pm and what is the ending time
pm so we are going to do hours 1st right l stay focused so we go 6 10 to 7 10 is one hour 7 10 no cause we are doing by hours
6 10 to 7 10 shhh 6 10 to 7 10 is one hour if i say 7 10 to 8 10 that is beyond the time that i am going time so now i am at 7 10 pm and i am trying to get to 7 37 minutes what i can add 30 minutes that will give me what
time so is that that is too many minutes so let us use smaller chunk 20 that gives me 7 30 pm 7 37 so i will it is one hour and how many minutes did i add
0 close one hour and 27 minutes everyone get that let us look at number 9 90 we did not do that we did not do 9
good keep and i want to see it worked out on scrap paper what what are you talking about
i had some one of these that i had on my desk you took it off of there do you know what happened to my comb i just had it on the table no table it is probably in your desk no i just had it on the table did you finish number 9 did you do number 9
mother go call your mother and tell you are sitting in here combing your hair during math time just because someone tells you to comb your hair does not mean you comb your hair seat and put the comb on my desk right there
has everyone finished number 9 hand finished give me some answers how many said a i said how many said b me come up
on we will be finished with this one we will do whole group in a few minutes i just happened to look at the time it says you want to watch a tv program that ends at 3 25 pm
pm if it lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes what time does the program start
can i no that is not correct cause it says what time does it start does it start if it starts wait a minute let us look at this if it starts at one 15 look and it ends at 3 25 one 15 to 2 15 is one hour and then 2 15 to 3 15 is 2 hours
3 15 so this is 2 hours and we have 3 15 well how many more minutes do we need to get to 3 2510 so in that case that would be what
2 20 right so that is not correct is it
do here we go again cause this is going backwards well not backwards but wait a minute so see you want to watch a tv program that ends at 3 25
3 25 if it lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes what time does it start 3 25 so let us try if it started at let us use the times that we have there since we have times let us use them let us look at a
if we started at one 35 am and it is one 35 we know that would not be 2 hours would it to get us to pm right
a because one 35 that is only one hour long if we said 11 15 am to 3 25 pm would that be 2 hours and 10 minutes
everyone try 11 15 to 3 25 tell me how long that is how many hours is that 11 15 to 3 25 how many hours is that
if we started watching it at one 15 pm how long would it take to get to 3 25 pm 2 hours and 10 minutes yeah 2 hours and 10 minutes cause it is one 15 2 15 3 15 hours 3 15 how many more minutes do we need to get to 3 25
how many more minutes to get to 3 25 one 15 when you have the answer choices just use your answer choices you ready
it is over here everyone understand it them if you are not sure plug them in and use that that was your ending time so you know the time the answer choices are your starting time cause it said what time does the program start if you have answer choices plug them in and use them and see if you get we are looking for it takes 2 hours and 10 minutes
if you like some of you said that was a use your time you are at one 35 that is taking too long to get you know that is more than 2 hours so that already would be eliminated use what you have to find the answers when you have the answer choices
papers we will get it right all of them
girls all set it should say 316
there all right so you know before the lesson s over at the end somebody remind and we ll go ahead and we ll put this back up and we ll make sure that the camera knows it s 316 okay in fact i m going to let you hold on to this and you can remind me at the end different i know i ve said once or twice before this year that we re going to do something the common kids haven t done in the past just like when we were in the fraction unit
so typically the decimal unit ended on friday that s in the past it ended on friday and they waited till middle school till you guys learned how to multiply and divide decimals we re going to start multiplying decimals today it the unit let s look at our objective
make sure that we look at it if we go through this to make sure we re sticking to it and at the end we can look at it and say hey did we do this says students multiply whole numbers by powers of 10 including 1110th or 0110th and 0 and 1100th so let s break it down whole numbers tell me what a whole number is
a whole number is like a whole they re whole numbers yeah you want to add to it
a whole number is a number that isn t part so if it s one and one half and the half would be part of another number okay so that s the question is one.5 a whole number 2 so as you re what you said it s a number that s whole and you have the whole number and as you said
so it s really a number that doesn t have a fraction or a decimal attached to it number just like the numbers behind us up here whole numbers easy we can multiply whole numbers time whole numbers but now we re going to start thinking about multiplying whole numbers times decimals now we re going to go back
today s lesson is a lot like pre work to that and it involves kinda what we did a lot this year earlier about what does the extra 0 mean it we re going to talk about powers of 10 are besides somebody we haven t talked to yet
think i think it s an exponent yeah wow okay anybody else said he thinks it s an exponent yeah he s going right direction there for sure what does it mean when we talk about multiplying by the powers of 10
mean if i want to multiply by the powers of 10 who remembers what the powers of 10 are way i don t remember but i think it is like you multiply a certain number by 10 you got it is so give me some of give me some of the powers of 10
numbers okay so 1010 100
it why 10000 and this is stuff that we ve done mean how much bigger
every time we add a 0 to a number how many times bigger is the number times so it s the 10th multiple of that number or 10 times that number right
something so we re going to start thinking of the powers of 10 but going in the opposite direction going away from whole numbers multiplying a whole number times a decimal number using the powers of 10 guys looking for relationships that we see and patterns here we re going to just go and we re going to learn everything there is to know about multiplying decimals we ll get to multiplying decimals times decimals just not today
today s a little pre work seeing relationships and patterns can i get these can you pass give everybody in the back row 2 of these please the back 2 rows and i ll take care of front 2 rows
way okay so what you re getting and you guys have seen this page quite a bit this is the fill 2 page that has 400 grids on it
i m giving you 2 of them because you might want to use another one later on for some exercises now everybody has one
up no i don t want you to throw in an answer right now representation the hardest thing i think for kids to for 5th graders 4th graders middle schoolers representations so luckily we have these 100 grids in front of us
you thank you so how would you use these 100 grids to show there s the representation word to show 4 times 11 hundredths see if you can use these grids go ahead guys and see if you can represent this if you can represent this on the 100s grid you should be able to determine what the answer is
minutes anybody not understand what i m asking
okay all righty did you raise your hand on the way back there the equation is 4 times 11 hundredths now you might be able to just tell me the answer on this but before we get to that point about telling me the answer i really want to think about what the answer looks like want to represent it
forward so what i want you to do is how many 100 grids are there in front of you 4 and how many squares are there in each grid 10100 so you have how many squares all together 40400 so you have 4 grids in front of you
i have this number 4 and i want to multiply this grid times 1100th and there s 100 squares in each grid and i want you to try to think for a moment and try to think about how that might look on this piece of paper in front of you
okay can i go get a pencil from the pencil jar sure you can get one behind my desk if there s none in it
shot come on up here and tell me what you do but you have to be willing to explain what you did as well okay
so i heard what he said as he said you just have to that he said it would be 4 hundredths so 4 times 1100th you re saying is 4 hundredths this looks like 4 hundredths here anybody do it differently and i think you re right i think the answer is 41 hundredths it is it looks easy you re right but we want to talk about how we get there okay
differently did anybody else want to come up show this differently
do i did times 4 what if i did this everybody agree that each of these is 1100th yes and that got the 41 hundredths he just put them all on one grid
what about an equation if i wanted to turn this into a fraction no why isn t it 110th k because it s in hundredths okay so it s in the hundredths so i know you know that if it was 110th it would be 0 and 110th but this is 100th so how would my fraction look
n it would be 101 hundredths wait 101 hundredths somebody i haven t talked to you yes it would be 100th 1100th everybody agree that this number and this number are equivalent
j have you solved this problem before this year a problem very similar to that a whole number times a fractional number done is 4 over one the same thing as 4 yes so does this come out to what
41 hundredths 41 hundredths is this equivalent to this yes let s change it a little bit more guys we just went ahead and we just took an equivalent fraction for our decimal what about this
one why don t you on your sheets if you want to use another one or the same one you can cause i know some of you guys didn t get anything written on the 1st one how could i represent this on like the 200 grids that go ahead
color so this now we re looking at 4 times 110th
good i see everybody i see some people did it all in one grid
okay i like the representation of using the 4 grids cause it really just shows the pieces of it guys i want you to think about how we had 4 times 1100th and 4 times 110th and see if that ties in to our objective of powers of 10 so if i want to go ahead and write this i get as says 4 tenths
fraction somebody i haven t talked to yet today k 4 tenths times what goes here 10101 hundredths everybody agree what 40 hundredths 41 hundredths does everybody agree that this is equivalent to this
tell me what the relationship is between this and this they re both the same they re both equivalent well they re not necessarily equivalent cause i don t think in order for them to be equivalent this number here would have to be equal to that number there and it s not
but we do notice something and i want to tie back to it about the whole thing we re doing today is about powers of 10 i m not asking you guys to multiply 3 and 16 hundredths times 9 and 110th
we re really thinking about powers of 10 and i m asking you do you see where it s coming into play up here this hold on to your thoughts and then we ll definitely get to you guys examples what if i did 4 times one
4 and i did 4 times 10 40 and i did 4 times what am i going to put here 100 talk to me now
at multiples of 4 multiples of 410 not 4 i mean you know you re right if i skip count by 4 eventually i ll land on 40 and if i keep skip counting eventually i m going to land on 400
so they are multiples of 4 but what we re really looking at is the 0 here 10 it means what everybody powers of 10 it means what powers of 10 powers of 10
mean multiples of 10 when you multiply times by 10 when you re multiplying by 1010 it is the 10th multiple of 4 the 40th multiple of 4 or the 4 the 100th multiple of 4 does it work with decimals that s the question
way we know that we add a 0 on to 10 we get 100 1000 1000 and that s how many times 11010 so every time we add a 0 it means that we re multiplying by 1010 this is the question of today objective does it work going the other way in decimal form
k i think it ll work but other side you guys heard what she said what the decimal to the right of the decimal all right you guys are going to get a chance to practice this okay
i want you to by yourselves we are going to go over one or 2 of these things and really look at it please pass those down here it says multiplying by powers of 10
please let me just grab one from you do you need one
yeah thank you i m going to leave this up here there are more of the fill 2 grids
representations you have 5 problems here multiplying by powers of 10 guys anybody before we start have a question about what we re doing here what i when you do these boys and girls i want you to look for patterns
patterns look for relationships and you ll find those with powers of 10 okay if you see a pattern don t just complete the pattern make sure you solve the problems but notice the pattern when you re done
sure obviously you know how to multiply the whole numbers notice the pattern that goes on when you re multiplying the whole numbers and then look at the pattern going backwards
pattern take another look at it yep hey this is good
guys we re going to go over this but i want to see if you can catch it before we do cause we re going to go over and then you re going to say ah i knew that what i need you to do is when you complete this sheet i want you to go back and i want you to look at the whole numbers that you re multiplying by each other and look at the patterns that go on every single time because what they re doing is they re basically adding a 0 here right
yes and then go back to the decimal numbers and see if what you ve put down makes sense in terms of powers of 10 i m seeing people writing down equivalents and obviously we re multiplying 2 different numbers there s 2 different equations and you re coming up with the same answer just an equivalent of that answer
what i mean by that guys is this number here is equivalent to that number there we know that 25 hundredths is the same thing as saying 250 thousandths right
may go ahead yes bathroom go ahead yes why don t you wait till one of them comes back unless you really need to get out of here good this is good you didn t do that the 1st time did you no
good no the 1st time i didn t do that but now you have to explain it to the whole class you know look what you did here
here i m having trouble you caught it didn t you just think about what s happening
here when did think about what happened here and what s what happened here
what s different about this and this even though these numbers are the same
here those these numbers are the same right so this and this that makes total sense here let me see what you got
okay it s very much the same here good different about this 2 what happened with the decimal here and why is it different here when these numbers are the same
nice job you got it i need to break out a new one
you you guys ready to go over it
walking around the room most people were not really working with the powers of 10 with i mean obviously with the whole numbers you were but with the decimal numbers you weren t and then people some people did see the proper way to manage powers of 10 in decimal format and as i talked to people they seemed to pick it up really quick
so let s just take a look at question number 3 excuse me
all right so the 25 is the same for all these problems and you saw that also with your other ones i believe too right the 1st number was consistent throughout all the ones that they asked you to solve right so when people were solving this did they just start and look at 25 times one there did anybody begin just by starting right up here
here so really i ve got everybody else either started here or here really what was the 1st thing you did here top or the bottom yeah what was the 1st step that you took in solving this
i started from the bottom and up thinking and that s fine cause you know so much about whole numbers and that s i don t have a problem with that at all
250 because you wrote 25 again as it would be one times 25 and then you just took this 10 yeah it s all stuff that s been taught and everybody s practiced it 25 and now we get into the work of the day right
today 0 and 25 did they wrote this number here right and then kids started getting it
sense why doesn t that make sense yeah i ll give you that but so but that s like saying this isn t my left hand because this is my left hand why i m looking for powers of 10
you i think this answer needs to go up here but i need to find somebody that can explain to me why and what the correct answer is here and why k the correct answer is 0 and 2.5 no cause isn t that the way when we re talking about decimals in math language we ll say 0
we always substitute the word and here and then we just say the number whatever that number is what the place value s going to be so i mean when you say 0 and 2.5 it kinda looks like that again i know you got it
right no come on this give me a 2nd think about what you want to say cause you know you got it
i know you do and we ve got 34 hours of film left here agree we ll get to why that goes up here but 1st let s finish this piece off
k i said what s the right answer here and tell me why and so we worked on one thing we said we re not going to do that and i think she was trying to say the right answer but the words that came out present a different number here and you jump in anytime you want if you see him going the wrong direction
i think the 0.25 should go on the 0 25 times one equal 0.25 true i m looking you re absolutely right but let s get rid of this now cause we know it s the wrong answer somebody you had that hand up real high
2.5 it s 2 and 5 tenths i agree this is the right answer now you can t just tell me the answer you got to tell me why it s the right answer it s because it s 0.10 so it s 25 2.5
0.10 so it s 25 so it has to be 22 wholes and then the wow that s an interesting way to say it wrong he s saying that this is 110th
here you can put 101 tenths into 10 and that ll make one whole again so you get your 2 wholes and then there ll be 5 left over and that s your half anybody want to add to this
j if you have 0 and 110th you can do 0 and 10100th and then you do multiply by 25 and it ll come out to 25 wow 0 i see
algorithm hey let me bring it back a little bit j you gave me this number here 2500 2500 here i got it
number sure you do here yeah is this a whole number yes where would i put a decimal then to keep it a whole number
right here no then it would be 2 and 51 hundredths i want it still be 25 i m sorry now it s 25 and 0 hundredths keep going here now it s 250 and 0 tenths keep going now what is it a whole 2500
there where would your decimal go here in that problem if you want it to be a whole yeah if i want to represent the number 250 where s that decimal going to go right here sure put it in there now how about for 25
go right here all right take a seat much so now we can start seeing a pattern here that the powers of 10 help us out with that we don t do this whole i only ask to do this so that you can see a pattern
so many students started off by going 0 and 25 hundredths but we can see if it s true if the powers of 10 going in the opposite direction i mean to the right of the decimal if it works the same way as it works with whole number then every time here we go guys
here comes the power of 10s including 110th and 1100th cause this is one up if it moved one space this way what will happen up here if the pattern continues
b if the pattern continues 0 and 251 hundredths yeah so is it fair to say that the powers of 10 work in decimals as well as whole numbers
that yes check your work on the other problems guys yes can i get let s wait till after we re done okay
this yeah all right we re not going to take this into thousandths the book is just going to stop us for right now in hundredths but i m thinking if we did have to deal with thousandths if it was 25 times 11000th i m thinking if i stick with my what i ve observed about the patterns of the power of 10 what i know about the powers of 10 going with whole numbers then it would continue
yes why not because you multiply 25 times the one because the others would be 0 do you want to come up and show me do math does anybody else disagree agree are people not seeing what we re talking about here
you know what we re talking about here no all right we re going to wrap it up again but let s see what you have to multiply by the one and that would be 0 can you write it down so that we can all see it space so multiply by 25
right let s go back to this i see what you re saying
say i m hearing you say because this 0 s here this should be a 0 here right because 25 times 0 would be 0 multiply by one and that s the same thing that happened 0 and 1100th that s a good question and i m saying that the answer to this is 0 and 25
right and you re saying that this is 25% this is 2.5% is that correct we want to see what it looks like as a fraction go all right so you set yourself as a fraction and i ll set mine up as a fraction
well it s 25 times this right so i m going to say i m going to keep 25 and put 25 over one cause i know that s 25 and i m going to times it by what s my decimal what s my fractional equivalence to 1100th 10 what do i put here
this now finish it up and that equals can you give me that in its lessest terms least terms equivalent okay so this is good
today we said hey you could add this 0 on here you expect to see the 0 on the other side and you re saying well i don t see the 0 on the other side you know it really started here when i really kinda liked s explanation it was kinda hard to see it but it was an interesting one
he is he kinda like had these compartments that he was filling them up with tenths and every time he filled up one compartment with 10 tenths it was a whole left he could only fill the 3rd one up halfway and that would ve been 2.5 it s not necessarily the way i want you guys to see it i d rather see you guys doing this
i d rather see with the great knowledge you have about all your fraction work and let s face it way i understand it s tough to see it sometimes way that s why you have to have more than one strategy to prove out these things
answer i don t think i really answered your question and it s probably something that i need to investigate more so i can give you a really clear answer to it i think it does have something to do with the way settled this one
smaller that s the best and the best i can give you right now this is the case guys where representations really pay off cause once you draw it out and see the representation it becomes much easier when you come up against in our mcats guys you don t quite understand what the problem s asking
make a representation the more time you put into thinking about a representation the more the problem will make sense with what s that i know it now what do you know that that now what is that if i had to sum this up what would i sum that up as
that let me get rid of some of this other stuff so we re not distracted what word have we used in this lesson over and over
kinda base this lesson around some we really haven t it hasn t been really about multiplying decimals as much as it is understanding the concept a concept of powers of 10 mean we know for whole numbers it means 10 times 10th multiple
1000 so the question of today was does it work with decimals does it work with 110th and 11 hundredths do we move the decimal one place over for each multiple of 10 and i think you got the answer was yes concerning why s that 0 gone all of a sudden what are you adding that 0 on
clear so we brought up some old strategies that we had with fractional work fractional equivalence and it seems to have helped yeah i don t get like and you said disagree i don t understand what
what i don t get is when that you said does anybody disagree and no one put their hands up well what i meant was if you it s more like you either have to agree or disagree middle i wanted didn t want anybody like just kinda going you know it s more like decision right will you support what she says or do you have a counter for what she says and you think that something else is right
problem any questions guys yes so there s going to be like it s going to be like the number and then there s a 0 like in front of it to the side you mean the decimal yeah you mean the decimal moving that way
board come up and show me with numbers cause it s when we talk about these the math talk with decimals it s really really have to pay really hard attention to it and once again i m going to go back to the old a representation a visual is much better for this then just trying to throw the words out go ahead
i m not sure i don t quite understand this can you show me what the what you re talking about if it s 2.5 and then 0.25 would it be 0.025 next what do you think
i don t know i m asking you all right take a seat saying she said okay teacher i see this but now if the next one was 25 times this which is 11 thousandths cause we did and we re not doing thousandths but i like the curious mind except when the curious mind says i don t know
i m asking you all right i like to see the curious mind take a little more proactive step into it so the question is i m going to try to squeeze this in here
she s saying if i had one more does it equal 0 and what according to our pattern does it
moved over one moved over 2 moved over 3 according to our pattern it would out how could we prove it out as a fraction like here s where you don t get away with just saying does it work so you got to walk me through the fractional equivalent okay
so it s still 25 times what 11000th is that right no
does that come out to in this case we re looking at what percent is that
right and i mean we can show that it what is it percent if we do powers of 10 going the opposite direction this is great k if i got rid of that and i made it hundredths i have to take 110th of 25 which is what
doesn t my decimal just move this way one just like my decimal moved this way one equivalent so now i have 2.5 over 100 and percent s are measured in 100s so it s 2.5% so yeah the answer s yes
the reason that we re not going into thousandths is just because guys they re not expecting you to do decimal work into the thousandths right now now the big picture here and the answer to your question was yes it will continue to work and it will work just like if we were adding a 0 on to a whole number just like if we re going from 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 to 100000 to 1000000 to 10000000 and so forth it works the same way going the other way
for you guys your work is just up into the hundredths this year you need to be proficient through the hundredths in multiplying fractions i m sorry decimals they will not ask you to multiply thousandths times thousandths they won t do it it ll just be hundredths times hundredths or tenths times hundredths but it s good to ask the question because it does come up next year just like this year we built on some of the stuff from last year
next year when you hit this unit they will probably talk about thousandths and you ll be ready to go cause you already know it works any questions let s stay away from this because this is not good for us right now but it s good to see it questions i can t answer that right now
we re going to go through the next 2 days with multiplying and then that the 2 days after that we re going to do dividing so let s wait till we get to that bridge i d love to answer that question now but let s just stick with this and make sure we re with it b you want to go ahead and do that
yes i need me some quick volunteers i want to see what this work looks like on the board this was 3 who s going to do number one for me up number one number 2 come on up
number 4 come on up so just list them out and let s see if everybody agrees with them go ahead please you think okay thank you
and the room is 316 not 306 yes
guys check your work against theirs outstanding
one yes do i have a do i see a problem up here closely no issue you mean these
here guys we don t i only put the decimal here with just to show you the pattern but certainly do not include a decimal after whole numbers when they don t need to be there necessary good that was only for effect okay 0 that s fine is this right that s fine
now the last question guys it asks you to write 3 statements about what you notice about volunteers besides today but this and i will talk to you about catching up these 2
r i noticed that like when they say that they always have can i interrupt you for 12nd
here right between the one is there a decimal right there that i can t see that s on the line yes and then this one here where s the decimal go here this is not 0 times 138 it s 138 times 0110th so who did this
one this is going to be look where the decimal is here powers of 10 what s my answer here 01
one and it now this is the 1st day of this too you guys so there should be there could be some gray area but we re going to practice it and we ll work on it
r real quick what was your they always have like the number like you always okay so this is what just said
one of the things he noticed is that the number that was the 1st number seems to have stayed for all of them what s the thing that s moved around here number i see an 8 you re right in all of them i mean 8 is not the same as 800
so maybe it s good to say 0 yeah you re adding zeros or what is it the thing that s moving around though moving decimals yeah the decimals the place value is shifting each time but the original number stays the original numbers changing in size based on the powers of 10 the movement of the decimal it s a good one
else come on here okay but what have you noticed
a the basic equation of the groups is the one that multiples is this the basic equation
it it multiples by 10 i see yep guys this is i think we can just kinda wrap this up j the they all are focusing on the power of 10 absolutely
the answers is always equivalent to a fraction the answer will always have a fractional equivalent definitely this does this have a fractional equivalent 800 good so you re right they all do have a fractional equivalent whether it s an improper fraction or a regular fraction
all right one last look at the objective it students multiply whole numbers 10 we did that down here one 10 and 100 and we also did it for one and we did it for 10th and we did it for 100th and we talked about it and we saw how the decimal moves every time we change one power of 10
excellent and can you reduce that can you reduce that
yes it would be 3 ninths can you reduce that exactly good point said the 13 doesn t divide into anything so this one is at its lowest form
correct and you did a really good job of explaining that one thing i was talking to someone about one way to find a common denominator is really just to multiply these and you can find one yes you can tell if it s the lowest or not by if the denominator can go into the other denominator can you give us an example of that
you want to try to do this one here yeah okay up so 3 times 6 is 18 but is 6 so you use the and you get that for the denominator then goes into 62 times -2 is 4
i add that together and i get but then since it s subtracting i don t do that
i do minus let s see which way you did it
if you re talking you shouldn t be because is up at the board he s explaining 3 times 6 is 18
okay then i did 6 times 2 is 12 is that the same thing as when she came up
one but still a half is a half is a half then all of those would be what one half one half which are equivalent equivalent fractions okay good so i just did it an easier way okay and you want to fill in the section
so we did say that there are many ways to come to the same answer and i know some of you have talked to parents and you ve learned it in a different way and that s fine the important thing is that you do know how to solve the problem
basically when you re adding or subtracting fractions you want to find a common denominator so whichever method you decide to use is fine with me 16 and also when you come up please explain what you re doing
c 8 divided into 16 is 2 so i put a 2 up here then i would do 2 times 2 equals 4 and if that was a set of 16 say 16 pennies then what would actually be happening
you d be bringing it what would you be making groups of and then how would you be dividing you d be making groups of 2
e 8 so we would use this we would make groups of 8 then by the time we were finished okay good and that s actually what you did d who wants to come up and try to explain it also as you do it
z have you been up
no this is 7 divided into 142 times so 27s would be 17 would be 2 so 27s would be 4 so the fraction would be 4 fifteenths so the answer is okay good and you basically explained that 2 times with sets and what was going on
e we had this number line i guess like maybe a week ago so as we learn things we cannot forget them so i always kind of have something like this as a review someone said they kind of forgot how to do this you just had to basically figure out what the pattern is so they gave us one and one half and then 2
well basically so it s one half the whole one.52 and 2.5 okay good job
let s take out your math notebooks because we re going to be using them today what we re going to talk about is how to come up with some kind of a rule for making an equivalent fraction so you should take out your math notebooks if you put them away
away you are going to need them because we re going to be writing down some information let s actually just define what an equivalent fraction is 0 equivalent if it s like the same
okay so a fraction like 5 twentieths is an equivalent fraction to 14th because 5 twentieths is 5 of okay good now does anybody else have another explanation
and when you re explaining think of maybe you re explaining it to a 2nd grader and they really don t get what an equivalent fraction is yeah i know you kind of have to really give a lot of details b i d say an equivalent fraction is not the same is not necessarily the same but it means the same thing
like one half means the same thing to 5 tenths so kind of like a family thing okay
person well i would say an equivalent fraction is equivalent equal 8 times 2 is 16
if you cut 16 in half you get 8 because you just double it and okay so then they would be equivalent let s look at our reference books
go to the back where the glossary is and let s just look at definition of what equivalent fractions are can you tell us what page it is on
265 and as soon as everyone gets done in the 265 it s located in the 1st column toward the end and it s right below the triangle
us okay fractions that have different but remain the same
so fractions have different denominators but the same amount
mind and it works with simple fractions you could have one half and then 4 eighths are the same
of so we could show something divided into one half then i started off dividing it the same as one half i make this into one half so you used 2 fourths instead yeah okay so i ll use your example
so one half and then decided to use a little bit different 2 fourths to show
it s working in fractions it should take about 5 minutes to do this
easy raise your hand if you re on page 207 okay good almost everyone we re just waiting on a few people while people are still getting out their books i m going to read the directions at the top it says color the squares and write the missing numerators
is numerator the top number or the bottom number in the fraction yes what does the numerator stand for okay so the numerator stands for what is going to be shaded it tells us what fraction of the whole it is
so at the top it says color the squares and write the missing numerators so you can just use your pencil and do that then number 2 tells you to color 14th of the large squares
and number 3 tells you to color 3 fourths of the squares so go ahead and do that and we ll talk about it in just a 2nd now is a good time
you re working at a good pace
some people are still finishing up what can you tell me about this page when you were coloring in your fractions
noticed is there a little pattern that s going on d the same amount is shaded but he said the same amount is shaded it s just that the parts are divided up differently say i would say that is right
and i worked on it so i realized that when i looked at the how do i translate it
portions what did you say they double and like 2 of the squares you d have to color 4 of them and like 8 or like 12 because okay good else i see the same thing with the answers the 1st one is one half is shaded
the next one is 2 and the next one is 4 and then it starts over and your 1st numerator is one and the next numerator is 24 then on the last one this number is 3 and the next numerator is 6 the next numerator is 12 okay good so basically we could say in problem one we re multiplying it by 2 cause 2 times one is 2 and 2 times 2 would be 4
then when we look at the next one the same thing happened but then it also looks like we re multiplying it by 4 too any problem can you see which one it looks like we might be multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 4
if you start with the 1st one let s look at the bottom it has 3 fourths it looks like for the last box where it comes out to be 12 sixteenths it looks like i multiply the numerator by 4 to get 12 and then i multiply the denominator by 4 to get 16
so with this problem right here we were multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 2 or by 4 in order to make it an equivalent fraction and we did talk about this a little bit yesterday too that if we do choose a number and we multiply the numerator and the denominator by it we can get an equivalent fraction
so i have up here on the board and i want you to use your notebooks i have an equivalent group what s a rule that you can make knowing these things in your book we were doubling it it but then there are other ways of finding equivalent fractions what s a rule that we can make
yes
i could multiply 5 times one because we re using one half and then 5 times 2 to find an equivalent fraction so what s a general rule that we can make in order to find an equivalent fraction what would you say part we want to be a little bit more explicit yes what s both of them
what does that mean but instead of just saying both numbers in a fraction what do we call both of those numbers the numerator and denominator okay good so that s a good start
then choose an example that you could do i would like for everybody to maybe try to choose your own example don t choose this one
i m going to find an equivalent fraction for one half and i m going to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 7 to find an equivalent fraction then i would get 7 fourteenths 7 fourteenths is equivalent to one half cause they both mean one half
it s just that 7 fourteenths are smaller pieces when you divide it up who has another equivalent fraction that they can make not using this one use something different and show me how you can use this rule with it yes can we still do the half no do something else try something else don t do a half
do something different because it will work with any fraction so you choose another fraction to do 15th it could be 2 thirds it could be 13rd
it could be one ninth 2 ninths choose anything and then decide on what you re going to multiply it by in order to find an equivalent fraction for the original fraction what s your example 11 twentieths is equivalent to 112 hundredths okay what did you multiply it by
10 so he decided to multiply his by 10 answer 112 hundredths 110 and then over 200 and this is an equivalent fraction to that are you d probably need to use maybe a microscope to see it it s so teeny
yeah okay what did you come up with i did 14th okay i need you to stop talking so you said you did 14th times 8 eighths eighths and you got what 32 8 over 32 is fine okay that s good cause it goes back and forth
3 fourths 3 fourths times 5 and i got 15 twentieths 15 twentieths okay
this does anybody know why it is good to know equivalent fractions what would be the purpose of us having to know that 3 fourths and 15 twentieths are the same
yes what do you think i think if someone said can you give me 15 twentieths of that pie it would be like 3 fourths right right and i think of 3 fourths too is 75%
and then too 15 twentieths i would think you would think no right if you really like the pie exactly so it is good if you can reduce them down or you can understand like say 15 twentieths just means 3 fourths then it makes an easier calculation for you
yes i did 4 fourths times 6 sixths said he did 4 fourths yeah he said he did 4 fourths times 6 sixths which came out to be 2420 fourths or one
one right or a whole that is true and we do know that when the numerator and the denominator are the same that it is a whole and no matter how small the pieces are right cause you might says can i have 2420 fourths of the pie no that would mean you get the whole pie
z i did 2 thirds times 6460 fourths okay wait a minute you said 2 thirds times what 192 128 and what else 192 192 another fraction with extremely small pieces okay the last one
i did 3 fourths times 8 eighths and i got 2430 seconds okay so the same thing but a different equivalent fraction for hers but they all mean i did hers and you changed it so they all mean 75% or 3 fourths of the pie
so again when you start seeing fractions like this and you can reduce them in your head then it helps to make better sense okay that being said let s move on actually what we re going to do for a few minutes is we re going to look at your fractions cards because we move on to the page what i d like you to do with your fraction cards from yesterday is to find equivalent fractions because they do have equivalent fractions
and remember yesterday he already kind of noticed it then i ll tell you what you ll be doing i m going to ask you some of you already have your fraction cards at your desk
i only collected a few of them raise your hand if collector okay will bring these by and if you ve already done yours i want to come over and i want to look at them and see what you have and then i m going to show you what you can be working on so as soon as you have your fraction cards go ahead and start finding equivalent fractions
so i want to see the piles of what equivalent fractions you can come up with i would 1st like you to try to sort them out according to the numbers and not the pictures and then you can maybe use the picture side to check it if you re unsure but if you remember it should match up like we did in the book
front i m putting them together to see if they re equal remember if you can try to look at them look at the fractions and number part try to see if you can do it that way 1st and if that way is too hard then you might flip them over easy so you re trying to find a match
so if i have one half then 5 tenths which also stands for a half those cards would match up if i had 4 eighths then that would also stand for a half and those cards would match up too so you re looking for equivalent fractions
let s think of it this way so you think 0
good you can put that over here
it goes there do you see anything that s the same as half
by some people you have a lot correct and then you have some mistakes you want to make sure some of you are trying to do it by looking at the picture and your eyes can play tricks on you
sure let s say your lowest fraction is 13rd then you want to make sure that whatever you put next to it that you re saying matches up you can multiply a number and get it so i could do this and i can get 3 ninths so i know 3 ninths would be an equivalent fraction
it i could say 4 here and 4 here and i could get 4 twelfths it has to be able to match up like that but i cannot say that 13rd matches with let s say 4 fifths that doesn t make any sense because i could multiply this by 4 but if i multiply the bottom part by 4 i would get 12
so the numerator and the denominator have to be the same you have to see does it match up if i multiplied it by the original fraction does anybody want to tell me some of their matches that they have i m going to do some of them up on the board so we ll do a check just tell me what you got for the halves for my halves which one are you doing
ahead i m doing 6 tenths and 3 fifths 6 tenths i ll start it off with 3 fifths because 3 fifths is the lowest common denominator then she said 6 tenths this does match up 10 i know that s an equivalent fraction what do you have
i have 5 fifths and 10 tenths 5 fifths and 10 tenths those match up s 5 tenths and one half 5 tenths i ll start it off with the lowest 11 half and she has 5 tenths good any others
i 2 sixths 2 sixths and what else did you do too and 4 twelfths okay did you get anything else with that because i could do 2 times 2 here and then 2 here
sorry so that s good 3 ninths and you got 3 ninths from that to go with this one right here
else 3 ninths and 3 twelfths and 3 twelfths i do not know if that one is going to work
a 13rd 13rd would go with this because i know that 3 times one is 3 and 3 times 3 is 91 half one half and what else and 2 fourths and 2 fourths so i ll put that here with the halves
i have 9 twelfths and 3 fourths 9 twelfths and then he has 3 fourths so 3 times 3 is 9 have 6 eighths and 6 eighths then that was basically just doubled
get 2 thirds and 6 ninths 2 thirds and 6 ninths okay c 14th and 3 twelfths 14th and 3 twelfths good i m trying to keep up and sure what did you get
3 sixths and 6 twelfths 3 sixths huh and 6 twelfths and 6 twelfths okay z i had 13rd is equivalent to 4 twelfths okay 4 twelfths and i think we have that somewhere
up here with 4 twelfths it s right there down there okay so we ll put all of those together what did you get i have 8 twelfths and 8 ninths 8 twelfths and then what did you say goes together
8 ninths 8 ninths so can i ask you how would we get that together because it takes one more number for each of them to get their regular number now i have to think can i multiply something by let s say this number and get this
okay so that might not be a match 8 ninths what did you get say i do not know if you have that done correctly let me see have you have one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 so it s going to be 6 tenths and 3 fifths so we actually have that one here good do you have another one
15th and 2 tenths 15th and 2 tenths for some reason i thought we had that we do yep 15th and 2 tenths he has 15th and then 2 tenths and that does make sense j do you want to add on yeah one half and 2 fourths i have one half and right 2 fourths i did see that
i think there was another one for the halves i think they had 4 eighths when i was looking at people does anybody else have that
14th 3 twelfths and then what was the last one you said 8 twelfths yeah thank you
a i think we don t have this 4 tenths and 2 fifths 4 tenths we ve had so many
4 tenths and then she has 2 fifths would be just out of curiosity matching them up was this a little difficult yes up how many people had to start off with the pictures 1st because i saw a lot of people looking at the pictures
i didn t i didn t use the pictures i noticed numbers i used the numbers and then someone told me that you could use the pictures so i used a little bit of the pictures a little bit of the pictures so yeah you want to challenge yourself a little bit and then also get the practice that we ve been doing on the board
does it make more sense to you now the dividing up of the parts but then it s the same amount lot it s a lot to think of and change your mind and seeing the parts and how they all come together yes
what i is how you can find out because see i was really really confused aren t these equivalent which ones are 3 fifths and 4 ninths i m going to erase this right here and i hear someone talking about something else and they shouldn t be
m 3 fifths and 4 ninths 3 fifths and 4 ninths and you re just trying to figure out are these equivalent fractions so 1st of all i would look at the numerator and i would say to myself can i multiply anything by 3 and get 4 already they re not equivalent fractions and the same thing here i cannot multiply anything by 5 and get 9
fractions okay whatever you can multiply by the numerator and the denominator will give you an equivalent fraction whether it s like this 6 6 and so on okay any other questions before we move on those when you re finding equivalent fraction you do
so the good thing with finding equivalent fractions is multiplying it by the same number at the top and the same number at the bottom so i could go 2 over 26 tenths i could decide to make an equivalent fraction with 10 i could say 10 over 10 and this would be 30 fiftieths that s an equivalent fraction i can multiply it by 3 fifths by 100
this would be 300 over 500 and then that would give me an equivalent fraction so the way to find the equivalent fraction is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number so is an equivalent fraction always a half is it always a half
half so this right here 3 fifths is 3 fifths a half no so we re just trying to figure out how to make them like i was talking to what actually is going on now there s no way we re going to be able to fold a piece of paper and get 300 over 500 much so this is a method to show you what s actually going on as something that s being divided into parts
so if i had a piece of paper here and i folded it in half so it s the same amount this is one half now i m going to make an equivalent fraction then i ll just fold it like this the same amount but i ve doubled it because i ve multiplied it by 2 so now i have on this side if this is the side that s shaded i have 2 fourths because i ve divided into 4 pieces
all right you know we ve been dealing with multiplication arrays 1st i want to read you a book and i want you to look for does anybody know what an array looks like
like an array looks like yes you draw a square and put the rows right it s a square and it has lines and rows yes
it this book is called 100 hungry ants written by elinor j pinczes a whole hill of hungry ants their faces all aglow came swarming from the forest to cross the hill below
a south breeze fanned the sunshine and whisked them on their way tummies that means a picnic hooray 100 ants were singing and marching in a row
we re all going to a picnic a hey a hidee ho stop said the littlest ant slow food will be long gone unless we hurry up
with 2 lines of 50 we better get there soon i know all the ants raced here and there up down to and fro
there will be lots of yummies for our hungry tummies a hidee he a hidee ho 100 ants were singing and marching in 2 rows
we re going to a picnic a hidee he a hidee ho stop yelled the littlest ant
slow more of the food will be gone unless we hurry up so with 4 lines of 25 we ll get there soon i know all the ants raced here and there up and down and to and fro we hope there s yummies for our rumbling tummies a hidee hey a hidee ho so 1st they were in 2 lines of 50
now they re in 4 lines of 25 100 ants were singing and marching in 4 rows we re going to a picnic a hidee hey a hidee ho stop screamed the littlest ant
slow lots of food will be long gone unless we hurry up so with 5 lines of 20 we ll get there soon i know all the ants raced here and there up and down to and fro there might be a yummy for a grumbling tummy a hidee hey a hidee ho
100 ants were singing and marching in 5 rows we re going to a picnic a hidee hey a hidee ho you see the 5 lines yes of 20
ant we re moving way too slow all the food will be long gone unless we hurry up so with 10 lines of 10 we ll get there soon i know all the ants raced here and there up and down to and fro
there better be yummies for our grumbling tummies a hidee hey a hidee ho 100 ants were singing and marching in rows of 10
at last we re at a picnic a hidee hey a hidee ho stop yipped the littlest ant
eat you took so long with rows all the ants raced here and there up and down and to and fro
there aren t any yummies for our grumbling tummies a hidee hey a hidee ho then the smallest ant says 0 no 99 ants were swarming from each and every row in hot pursuit of one little ant who quickly turned to go
it s not all my fault you know what do you think happened what did they do they were chasing him what was he doing he stopped them every time and that s why they didn t get any food i guess so but now as i read this book you heard me saying different rows and different lines
this remember this what was i doing who remembers i was doing factors and products and does anybody remember what the product was from the story the product was what 100
100 remember the product is equal to 100 factors they re called factors right 100 2 times 50
wait a minute quietly think of everything that can give me 100
off i don t know why they put this in here what s one thing that can give me 2 factors that can give me so we re trying to get to we re trying to make 100 right
10 10 times 10 give me one one times 101 25 times 4 else are there any more remember the story 50 times 2
50 times 2 20 times 5 else yes 100 all the factors i have are one 2 what else
5 why is it i don t know why this won t do it why don t you just use the other board because i don t know if they can see it over here
100 one times 100 is 100 them 4 times 4 25 what else
5 50 times 2 do we re going to make an array the 1st thing we re going to do is practice making one with our pencils
everybody should go to their desk not over there don t hit the camera not over there those of you that sit on this edge just go ahead and find a seat with somebody and sit with them 20 and 5
1st no you can sit right here you sit on this side and you sit on this side
basically an array you can t sit right there come over here and find a seat see you just sit right there on the edge
so basically an array is just a multiplication problem i m going to give you a sheet of paper and this is what i need you to do
just sit right here please i need you to take take everything off your desk
you should have noticed how all the ants were making their different lines and rows to come up with the product 100 for example let s take let me find one row that they did
25 look up here it should look like this
let s say i have this this multiplication problem the 1st number 25 that s how many i m going to have going across okay
25 i m going to do one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 now i have 4 lines of i already have one right here
4 it s kind of hard to do with this because the board is off center i m going to have to go in and fill in all my dots i would have 25 going across on each row and 4 lines 100 i want you to practice this i m going to give you another example
i want you to try 8 times 7 now 8 is going to be the number that goes across everybody fill in 8 of the dots
this everybody fill in 8 8 yes now how many do you go down 7 count the 1st dot
more now i want you to fill in all the squares that go with that and then count them up and tell me how many you have 8 across 7 down then go in and fill in each one
you re going to go all the way down to here and count up all the ones you did this is what an array looks like
56 how many did you get 56 count them up and tell me how many you had what did you have 56
56 so basically an array is just a multiplication problem you have 2 factors that equals to what 56 did everybody count up 56
yes let s try another one down let s try somebody give me a number 9 9 times 3
so the 9 is going to be the number going across and the 3 is going to be the number going up and down
yes i need you to do the problem like i asked you should have 9 going across and 3 going down how many did you get 27 correct what did you get 27 i should see it on your paper down what did you get
here i want you to give me one and then tell me what the multiplication problem is
1st i think i know what the problem is
out of a class of 30 students i only have one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 i only have 25 students that can tell me what this problem would be up so i have 29 students up
who can go up to the board and write it explain it to me then write it for me somebody let s try
very good the 5 is the numbers going across and the 4 is the numbers going up and down okay we re not getting ready to cook or eat i have beans for you guys and i m going to give you a multiplication problem and here s what i need you to do 1st up this is what i need you to do
i ll wait instructions i m going to give you some beans but you have 3 things you have to do we ve been practicing our multiplication i have 3 things i need you to do
we re going to incorporate them by doing this we re going to incorporate some writing 1st i need to give everybody a piece of construction paper then fold it in half downward then open it back up
do i need to make sure i give you a white piece so you can see right
stay here fold it up
do i need find my cabinet and get some glue out
i need you to fold it hamburger who doesn t have one remember everything we do nice and neat it will go up
hamburger i ll wait until i have everybody s attention then i need you to take your pencil and let me show you what i need you to do
take your pencil and draw a line where the crease is on your paper then you re going to take the line and draw it straight down then you re going to draw a line going across like this
keep these papers because you re going to need them for a 2nd
yes perfect make sure your name is at the top
i m going to give you a multiplication problem and this is what you re going to put on it
you re going to make an array with your beans and the problem that i m going to give you is 11 times 3
3 on this side i need you to write the problem down and solve it in the space up under it i need you to write how you solved it
multiply even if you want to use the little story we told about the mom reading to the kids if you want to use that little story to tell how you multiplied it and then on this side you need to create your array i m going to put some glue on your paper and give you some beans and the beans are going to be your dots
array does everybody understand what you re doing
yes now you only need a little bit of glue because you re just going to dip your you need a little bit of glue for your beans
you might need to share your glue with someone you need more beans than that because you re doing 11 times you need more beans you don t know what you re doing yet it the answer s not hard to figure out
do you guys i ll get the glue and you guys use the glue you got it use the glue you write it down the problem goes has her problem written down
then in the next box you multiply the problem you have to write down the steps diagram i need steps 1st 2nd this is what you do 1st this is what you do 2nd you guys use some of your glue
you ve got to use his glue okay what did you say
make sure your lines are straight and spaced out a little bit
neat if we don t have anymore beans i ll get some more door i love the way s paper looks you have to answer it write down how you solved the problem
i love the way s looks answer and get your information together
you i said act like it s 33 of you you can t space them out too big to where you don t have enough room
what s wrong do the other part of your problem i ll get some more 33 write out the steps
so make sure you are copying your vocabulary words down the definitions and the examples
she needs an eraser but it turns out and she didn t know how to turn it did you ask her if it was okay that you touch her property okay yes
i can not see for the table okay in a few minutes i ll let you copy somebody else is microphone make you are doing your work okay
yes she can copy from my book i am finished can copy from my book i am finished if you are finished minute she can copy from my book thank you
when you are finished put your pencil down into your pencil holder so that i can see you are ready
where is your math notebook you are finished
what are you going to do
maybe you can work on some old pages that you didn t finish in class units one minute bless you be careful yes
do me a favor and move to the left a little okay you are on the cord please you are on the cord can you move that please move over a little more
favor you move that way a little more and you move that way a little more please thank you that that way we do not pull a plug out
we are going to go over it in a 2nd a few seconds okay any volunteers any volunteers
l place value the value of a digit that often changes depending on its place in the number very good l what are some places that each of those digits can be in
there 10000s 1000s 100s 10s and ones very good 10000s 1000s place 100s place 10s place and the ones place very good
j landmark numbers numbers that are familiar or comfortable over the entire line very good j 10s 20s 25s 50s 100s and 5s very good very good anyone have anything they want to add to either one of those vocabulary words
m i think one should be value
why because with the 1st one it said place value so i think we should do value because if you do value it is sort of the same thing as it is almost the same one to the place value okay
f i agree with and i would like to add onto hers if you put the word value and then 10000 is a value of something it could be the value of a car right
i have one for the landmark numbers okay 100000s 100000s okay
do you feel that the 100000s is a landmark number
1000000 do people agree that 100000s and 1000000s are okay okay why do you feel like the 100000s and the 1000000s are comfortable landmark numbers for you to count by right so you are not thinking landmark numbers you are thinking place value okay so you would add 100000s and 1000000s place
d i was going to say for landmark numbers to 2s because 2s are easy okay 2s we can add 2s to landmark numbers because 2 are a comfortable number to count by also thinking and i see people agreeing with you
right so if i can have you just come over here to the carpet
okay so over the next couple days you are going to be making a book that counts all the way up to 1000 all the way up to 1000
and this 1000s book is going to help us to find numbers in order to solve problems that go up to 1000 and it will help us see how the number system works yes so if we have the 100s charts do we have to tape them together to make a 1000s we will talk about how we are going to do that
i like that question but let us talk about how we will put our 1000s books together yes is there going to be a certain number that we are going to count by for our 1000s chart good question are there certain numbers that you think you would want to count by when you are making more 1000s chart yes i would like to count by a 100 you would like to count by 100 okay why
because i feel like 100 is much easier cause 100 times 10 equals to 1000 okay 100 times 10 equals 1000 else any other landmark numbers that you think that you would want to count by
why because 10 is kind of the same like 100 but like 10 times 10 equals 100 and 100 times 10 yeah 10 equals 200 so kind of i am sorry you are being very rude right now
ahead so they are kind of like the same thing so i would do the 10s okay you would count by 10s
1000 a 100 times 10 is 1000 no it is not yes it is
okay what happened to hands what happened to your hands a 100 times wait a 100 times 1010 equals 1000 okay
j i remember that easier counting is 50s 50s you would want to count by 50s okay can i i want to bring it back a little bit because we had some disagreeing going on about 100 times 10 being equal to 1000

okay i see people agreeing with you a i disagree with because if you skip count by 110 times that will get you to 1000
f a 360900 a 1000 everybody who said a number raise your hand 12345678910 yes yes i was thinking that said 100 times 2 equals 1000
yes i respectfully disagree with when she said that said 100 times 2 because i think i said i thought because i thought i heard him say 10 times 100 equals 2000
d i am just making sure did i hear say 5 times 100 equals 50 no 5 times 10
0 i thought i heard him say i can say that i did hear you say 5 times 100 equals 50 and maybe it was a mistake mistake you said 5 times 100 equals 50
j i respectfully disagree with about the 100 times 2 equals to 1000 because that equals to 200 i know that i said i thought i heard that okay another way you can land onto another landmark number that could get you to 1000 is 50 because 50 times would you come back to me i am thinking about 50 times something okay someone want to help out a little bit
f a 150 times go ahead i was going to say 50 times 200 yeah 50 times what nice and loud 50 times 2050 times 20 equals what a 1000 equals a 1000
i respectfully disagree with i think it is wait 75 times 20 i think it will be 700 700 you think 50 times 20 is equal to 700 is what you are saying
so i say that because 5 times 2 equals 7 and then all you have to do is add the 0 place a 0 at the end okay
j me too i think he was thinking 5 +2 equals i think he was thinking 5 +2 because 5 times 2 equals 10 so do people agree with that 50 times 20 equals 1000
yeah because we are going back to talking about what said about counting by 50s and using 50s as landmark number to count by 100 well different people i am going to back up a little bit different people said different landmark numbers that they think would be comfortable to count by in their 1000s book
2 somebody said we can count by 25s okay now we are trying to figure out someone said i am sorry
j i disagree with that never mind never mind all right so let us move on okay i am glad we had that discussion
what i would like to know now my next question is that so we are going to make our 1000s book and our 1000s book will have one blank 100 chart you ve seen these 100 charts before but usually they are filled in
in usually your 100 charts are filled in okay they are usually filled in blank we have to fill them in ourselves okay if each of these pages has 100 squares okay
each of these pages has 100 squares how many of these pages do you think we will need to make our 1000 book
back bring it back bring it back what did your partner say tell us what your partner said well my partner said 10 because who was your partner
okay he said that 10 because he thinks that 10 is an easy number to get to 1000 okay he said your partner said that you need 10 pages because 10 is an easy number to get 1000
our question is how many of these 100 blank charts do we need to reach 1000 to make our 1000 book j i said that you would need 10 100 charts 10 100 charts how do you know
because 10 times 10 i mean . would you like a little extra help somebody because if you skip count by 110 times that will get you to end up at 1000
okay so says if you skip count by 100 and you say 100 times 10 you skip count 10 times you will reach 1000 agree what else anybody else
l i think we need 10 pages i agree with and m that we need 10 pages because if you skip count by 110 times you end up with 1000 l i think 10 pages because i know that 100 times 10 equals 1000
you so we are going to need 10 of these pages 10 of these pages now we know we need 10 pages but now we have to think about how come on around you can come on around you can put that down and have a seat
now we need to think about how we are going to start on each page okay no matter what you have to have a 1st number and you have to have a last number okay and we cannot fill in more than we are not going to fill in every single square that s not efficient i do not want you to fill in more than 20 numbers on a page
you can fill in less than that if you want but you will not fill in more than 20 numbers on a page okay so we need to figure out what number we are going to start with on the 1st page what number we are going to end with on the 1st page yes you can count by 10s okay hold on we can use 10s as a landmark number but i want to know what number are we going to start with
number what will be our very 1st number one unh do people agree
okay i think 5 because 5 you can count by 5s instead of going one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 disagree i think it should be a different number because you said it can not be more than 20 and if you count by 5 and you get to 20 you will not get to 1000
up let us say that this is one what number is going to go right here where 10100 people agree okay okay 100 now we need a landmark number that we want to count by
t what number would you count by if you were counting and you need to get to 100 but you need a landmark number that you feel comfortable with and we are going to fill in some numbers here okay what would you count by somebody i haven t heard from m i think i would count by 20s you would count by 20s too
okay what about you i agree with by well i would obviously count by 100 but we can not i was going to say count by 20s because it would be more easier okay you would count by 20s what would you count by
5050s okay people lot of people agreeing with you okay so i am going to turn your attention right over here for a 2nd so we said we start with one and we end with 100
end turn and tell your partner all right bring it back
if page one begins with number one and it ends with 100 and we know that there are 100 squares on each page then tell me what page 2 tell us what page 2 is going to start with j 22 and 50 people agree that page 2 is going to start with 2 and then it will end with 50
i disagree with because if you do that you will be past 100 wait you will be behind 100 but we are already past 100 okay can you move over here please from behind the desk 100 okay so where would you start
a 101 filled to 200 so you would start says he would start with 101 and he would end at 200 d it would probably still be 100 because we didn t it is 101
no i agree with now okay have a seat have a seat please yes
a i think it is 100 and through 200 because at the end of 100 there is another chart it is 100 you have to start with 101 to repeat it is still going okay so are people agreeing with this yes what about page 3 what about page 3
what will we start with 200 no i think it will be i am sorry my people over here you are not excluded from paying attention to the lesson
lesson you are still going to do the work stop go ahead i think it will be i think it will be 201 and 300
say they know what they are supposed to do a 201 through 300 how many people agree
agree since everybody agrees i ll write that in here 201 to 300 l 301 through 400 show me your thumbs agree okay 301 through 400
page 5 and we will stop right here page 5 page 5
it will be 410 sh let her think do you see any patterns happening
noticing that at the end of each number you put a one and it goes and for the ones that say 100 200 300 400 there is a 0 at the end okay and for these you see that i have a one at the end
here say excuse me me go ahead 401 and 50401 and 500 love the way you just seen a pattern and you used it okay and so we see the pattern yes
do yes okay so here is what is going to happen long here is what is going to happen now that we have decided hey that we know where our pages start and our page ends you want to count by
100s 100s who said 10s
okay whatever number i ask you to choose i mean whatever number that i ask you you should easily be able to go in this chart and find it and i will tell you in the past i have had children students choose numbers just because it is comfortable but they just think 0 this is a high number and it is comfortable for me that and then when i ask them to go and pick the number they have a hard time finding it
i need you to be able to just look see that you have a number somewhere and be able to know where the number that i asked you for is located in your chart okay yes actually can i ask you later so let us maybe say that if we were going to skip count by maybe 5s okay
side so here 123455 sorry 5 if this is 5 then i know this must be know well each row in each column has how many squares
by 1010 chart right 10 by 10 array pretty much right 10 what is next 1515 where should 15 go maybe can you stand up and write 15 please where you think 15 would go
see where we going to write 20 okay so so far remember i said i do not want more than how many numbers 2020 so so far we are up to 12345 okay
come on up and then number 2525 people agree
number 3030 okay do you see a pattern happening right now do yes because as great mathematicians we look for what patterns patterns what is the pattern that you see happening i see that under the 5 there is come on up
under the 5s under the 5 row right there you could see that at the end of them they are all 5s and then under the 10 right here you can see that all of those end in 0 and they are also multiples of 10
it and we will have one more person come up and then i have another question i want to ask you and we are going to move so we can start to make our books that 35 yes okay come on up be people agree
question where in the world can we find number 23
23 all right bring it back
23 where in the world on this chart would we find number 23 and how do you know
cord write number 23 and tell us how you know
that all right go again
23 because when i started from 25 and then i minused 2 because i knew 23 +2 equals 25 so 25 -2 would equal 23 how many people found 23 by using the same strategy used more let us try one more
where would i find number 18 up and then tell us how you know
know because 18 +2 equals 20 and all you have to add is the 2 and it will equal 20 strategy okay all right thank you all right so we are going to get started with our books books before we move on i ll answer questions started we have to get off of the carpet we have been here for a long time
okay do you have a question it is a comment i need a question sorry i need a question question if the numbers the people that chose the same numbers to skip count by can they like be a group well this is sort of an individual
desks and the people who are sitting down the same row as you if you need a little help a little guidance it is okay to ask them a question okay all right i am going to ask you to go to your desks ladies to your desks be careful do not step on the gentlemen you so that was very immature
table gentlemen to your desks and please do not crawl thank you put these away
away put your sabs away put your sab and your math notebooks away i am only calling people are efficiently sitting quietly
please every person needs to get 10 of these okay
you as soon as you get your paper your blank 100 chart you can begin
10 do me a favor you can you please grab 123 clipboards and bring them over here please
yes which is why it was very important for you all to pay attention to the lesson 345678 yes sir hm
okay we are not sure yet 6 okay no problem 8910 okay i am going to make sure i have enough pages okay
23 right there 45678910 hold on
pages and when you get started can i suggest something when you get started hi 123 all eyes on me
here when you get started you might want to start by writing lightly the numbers that you are using because and then you can go over them with your pencil and make them darker later because if you mess up because you are going to go back and double check right if you mess up you can erase it and write in another number or whatever okay
right here 1234 on yes is this one we had to count by teacher say that again is this our number we have to count by you are going to use a landmark number that you feel is comfortable to count by
here if you think 10s are more comfortable if you think 50s are more comfortable whatever number you choose it needs to be comfortable for you and you need to be able to look if i say where is number 17 you need to be able to find it immediately okay my expectation is that you can find it immediately all right using the comfortable numbers that you used so i have to do like you did it up there but just the one and the 100
5s i know that s what i am talking about it is the one and 100 i have to use that yes start with that it is one and 100 yes there was a great question someone said do we 1st of all let me make sure
some she needs 7 more 7 no i need 8 more i only got 278 yes do me a favor come can you go downstairs and ask them to please make ask for 20 of these
you i gave him my supplies okay thank you hi someone said something that was important they said what was the question you asked me do we have to count by 5s okay you do not have to count by 5s
you can use the landmark that you would like but you have to write in the 1st number and the last number in so one and 100 need to be written in 101 and 200 need to be written 201 and 300 and so on and so forth
in the other numbers that you use need to be landmark numbers but they also need to be you also need to be able to easily find a number that i ask you on your chart clear yes teacher now at the top of your page i need you to label your pages
so your 1st page will be on the top one to 100 okay your 2nd page will say 101 to 200 okay yes raise your hand if you need me and i will just come by
yes so if we count by 20s do we still but we can not land on 101 if you count by 20s if you count by 20s you can count by 20s that is fine if that s a comfortable number for you the question is is if i ask you where 74 is if you are counting by 20s will you be able to find 74
way yes so then we do not use the 20 boxes do we
so you are not filling in every single box but you are going to fill in the 1st and the last box and then you are going to figure out which comfortable number you want to use
100 and right here you want to write one to 100 like i did up there now if you are counting by 5s you want to where are you going to place 5 right here okay count to make sure 12345 okay so you put a 5 right there
and now what comes after 5 if you are skip counting 10 okay all right so now you can start to fill in your boxes but i do not want you to fill in more than 20 boxes okay right okay yes do we do this for all the other pages the 200
100 okay you did okay good 401 to 500 good okay so if this is one to 100 what should be right here if this is 101 to 200 you and have you decided what you are going to count by
10 okay so write 101 there and if you are counting by 10s where are you going to place 110 on this chart
know because 110 has 10 at the end so you put right there and because there are 10 columns 12345678910
you i would love raised hands name i would love raised hands and patience and i will be right over to you never mind i got it yes
count by the 10s you can use the comfortable number that you would like to use number it doesn t have to be the same as your classmates okay
yes okay i only need 812345671 more yeah there you go
now here is my question where do you find 278 on this wait a minute okay good 244244 how do you know wait
how do you know because if i know that is 244 up 1234 and then i will know it is 244
okay thank you
yes yes i just realized something but not about this it is not about this but it is not about this what are you counting by here
2s by 2s so where can i find 227 i am counting by 5s you do not have to change it
227 right here 227 how do you know 0 so because i know that if you have 222 you add 5 and it equals 2 +5 equals to 7
227 good now i am wondering do you think this will help
i do not know how comfortable you feel with it but do you think counting like this by 2s is going to help you if i say find 675 same but i just need to know that you will have easy access to numbers that i ask you to find
okay okay how is it going finished okay is it supposed to go like this but go what do you think what are you counting by
5s 5s okay top when you label your chart what should be written up top one to 100 what are you counting by 5s 5s so just double check and make sure your numbers are in the correct place okay
yep well here is what i want because i see you are saying 5 10 15 but if i count from here to here that is 105 and if i count from here to here that is 110 but if i count from here to here 110
0 and you are missing your 100 here
good you said you are finished more so you can not fill in more 20 but you can not fill in less than about 15 no more than 20 but no less than 15 all right so i do not want you to fill in 3 numbers and say i am finished okay no more than 20 but no less than 15
no less than 15 50 so right here you need at least 15 numbers there is this okay you need at least 15 numbers filled in
yes trust me like i said in the past people filled out their chart really quick and then when i come around and i say where is 732 and they do not know where it is even though they have their chart filled out i am really looking forward to you being able to easily access certain numbers on your chart so you need at least 15 numbers on your chart
yes you need at least 15 numbers on the chart are you doing all 10s 10s okay that is fine that you are counting by 10s but you can pick another number some other numbers to put in
yes do another number huh do another number you are doing a number i am looking even though we said some of us said we can count by 50s i am a little uncertain that that is going to be helpful for you even though you feel like that is a great landmark number i would love for you to fill in at least 15 numbers on your chart okay so even if you counted by 10s go in and fill some numbers in okay yes 0 never mind yes
i do not get when you say so how many numbers do you have on your chart 44 okay you need at least 15 numbers on that chart that i am doing both and then i am going to spread them out i have 10 on each page plus the 2
you so if you started off counting by 10s that s fine but now you have to go back and fill in a couple more numbers okay i count by 100 can i still skip count by 5s absolutely yes keep on doing it because i did 500
10s i did it by you did this by 10s 10s hen if we get out to 10 you know what i would like you to do
100 right here i would love for you to count 1234567812345 and write a 5 there if you are here at 10 write 11 12 13 14 15 write 15 there that s what i want you to do okay okay cause i like that you said you were going to count by 5s
that all right cause i think it is going to be a little bit of a struggle for you to find numbers on here with just only using the 10s okay so i want you to count by 5s that s fine
that but i just want you to be able to have easy access to find other numbers yes say that again 40 no you need to fill the whole page in
numbers 12345 so 12345 so if i asked you where 777 where you going to show me 777 it is going to 5 it is going to be right there where
know show me how you know because see when i am going down to try 45 55 65 75 okay so if that is 75 i asked you for 777 777 yes
so this is why i want you to just go ahead and fill in your 10s and fill your 5s in
0 this will be like 00 what just one i am going to need me a lot more time because look i need to do more that s fine
days teacher i am on page 7 now i am on page 8 yes is this right well you tell me
10s 10s okay if you are counting by 10s and are you labeling the top what 30300 okay where would i be able to find 246 on your page
right over here how do i know because 9 take away 60 i mean 9 take away 3 would equal 6 okay so show me
46 hm do you see why it is important to be able to count in a way that you can really find actually find the number that i asked you what about 273 right here what about 278
what about 294 right here show me 291 292 293 294
okay good i am coming around with okay what i need you to do is put your name on every single page
every single page 1st and last name i only got one paper ah
it what do you put there i am going to tell you what to do in a 2nd in the blank like this yes you can write your name on that write your name on these manila colored sheets sheets use a pencil for now
yes i ll make sure you get another one why do we need 2 i ll explain in a minute what is that for i am going to tell you in a 2nd okay
just write your name on both of them all right here you go you you are welcome are you sure this is 10 10 right
started so that means when your class is going to do it you will have already started right that will feel good because you already know how to do it i started doing them yeah teacher b will be happy to know that you already started okay on these manila colored sheets please 123 all eyes on me
you on these sheets right here you need to make sure you write your 1st and your last name on both sheets once you are finished you are to take your charts make sure they are in order 1st 2nd 3rd 100 to 200 201 101 to 200 201 to 300 301 to 400 make sure they are in order
then you need to stick them right in between the pages neat i am going to come around and collect them okay yes can i have another manila yes sorry
i am finished i want to help no i do not think anybody is finished we have a couple days we are going to be working on them listen to my words we have a couple days in which we will be working on these today we have a couple days in which we will work on them okay
so do not worry if you are not finished you have a couple days
go you are welcome i am wondering who is going to be quiet so that we can be efficient because we still thank you you are welcome thank you
very good thank you m and m thank you more yeah a 100 chart
this here you go paperclip can you go around and collect these books please thank you
paper a lot more still going to have to buy some more
good that would be wonderful who is thank you
you are welcome thank you you are welcome thank you you are welcome thank you
let us see who is ready to write their homework down because we have like 3 minutes
all right so that was a pretty good review of what we did yesterday with equivalent fractions were what for some reason just asked me what my mom studied for college that s weird well we should get her to come in and talk to us
that s nice that he s shown an interest though so we reviewed that was real considerate okay today s just a practice day for that all right some of you didn t get to the paper that we re working on off the chair yesterday so we re going to try to get to that today that some of you can just look at these fractions and immediately know what the equivalent is
and some of you actually have to sit and do the multiplication or the division and that s okay so today we re going to do our practice by starting with the hershey s fraction book okay and that s the same kind of the same picture i have up there on the screen all right so just pay attention fractions i want you to look at the pictures and hear the words and match up the picture with what you re thinking about fractions
yes didn t the last time we did that didn t we use the book or something else to do fractions this book yeah we i think we had this in the math station once for math workshop activity didn t we it put your hands down and let me see by looking at you that you re actually focused and paying attention if you struggle a little bit with equivalent fractions yesterday today s your day to get that nailed down okay
fraction we just talked about what those fractions mean when they look like that right famous before we eat it we are going to learn about fractions figure let s start by taking the wrapper off litter here we have one whole milk chocolate candy bar
fraction a fraction is a part of or a portion of the whole thing we are using a hershey s milk chocolate bar as our whole thing and it s the same as that picture that s on the active board small so here s our next fraction which is along if you break this candy apart candy bar apart you will see 12 equal sections 1234567891011 and 12 because they don t you can stack the 12 equal sections on top of each other
hey it looks different but any way you arrange them they still equal one whole candy bar up maybe this is the easiest way to understand fractions eat 112th of a candy bar or would you rather 11 twelfths of a candy bar 11 twelfths if you love milk chocolate the answer is simple
fun so here s our 112th and here is 11 twelfths here is one half of a hershey s milk chocolate bar and here is the other half one half when 2 fractions equal each other they are called equivalent fractions the word is up there right what do they do if we re just looking at it numerically
what did they do to the numerator and the denominator to go from one half go here s 13rd of a hershey s milk chocolate bar this our candy bar can be divided into 3 equal groups
sections what is left over is 2 thirds 13rd +2 thirds equals 3 thirds when the top number and the bottom number are the same fraction excuse me the same the fraction is equal to a whole a whole and that s what this picture says yeah i d like it if you d stay with me please all right
13rd 4 twelfths is equal to 13rd you see that it yeah there s 13rd and there s 4 twelfths so it s a different fraction that names the same sized piece right over 8 twelfths 8 twelfths is equal to 2 thirds 4 twelfths +8 twelfths equals 12 twelfths which equals one whole candy bar okay
i like whole candy bars here s 14th of a hershey s milk chocolate bar if you want to call this fraction one quarter that is okay too leftover 3 fourths or you could call it 3 quarters right can you figure out what name they re going to give this 14th 3 twelfths it s 14th but what name are they also going to give it
2 fourths 3 twelfths 3 twelfths why 3 twelfths because there s 3 there s 3 and how many were there altogether is 3 twelfths 3 twelfths is another way of saying 14th did you know that the top number of a fraction is called the numerator and the bottom number is called the denominator way 3 fourths is equal to 12 ninths or excuse me 9 twelfths i misread it
fractions if it s got a 2 or a 3 quite often it s the numerator question sometimes i don t really have to do the division or the subtraction i just have to some people can just look at it and they have to think about it for only like 5 seconds and then it just pops right in year if you came out as a visual learner then you re probably someone that can look at it and decipher it from that
picture this is 15th it s time for something different page 4 cows have black spots and one has red spots either what 15th of the cows on this page has red spots did you ever wonder why hershey s chocolate factory was built in the middle of a farm country
milk one of the 3 main ingredients used in making milk chocolate is milk and then over here we have 17th if 6 cows mooed and you mooed also your moo would be 17th of all the moos on this page
from quack quack quack quack you see where your moo is coming from quack quack quack quack quiet 16th back to the candy bar we need to learn how to put the fraction a fraction to it s lowest terms simplifying if you divide the numerator and the denominator by the same factor you can simplify this fraction to lowest terms
16th is the lowest terms of 2 twelfths so here s 2 twelfths dividing the numerator and the denominator by 222 divided by 2 is one pay attention
6 sit down 5 sixths is what is left over from a whole candy bar after removing 16th how many twelfths are 56th ah 10
okay there s 12 twelfths in one whole candy bar right 16th is 2 of those so if we take 2 out we have 10 left okay and what s the equivalent fraction for 10 twelfths 5 sixths 5 sixths 5 sixths he thinks faster than me i have to think about stuff 2 twelfths here s an equation that is easy to understand this is what we were just talking about
16th is equal to 2 twelfths like here s what we were just saying here s another way to say 5 sixths 10 twelfths it s starting to look more delicious after every fraction we show so here they re showing that 5 sixths and 10 twelfths are what kind of fractions equivalent equivalent fractions okay and then here s a break from chocolate again
pods the cocoa tree grows in very warm and moist climates pods if one pod fell off and bonked you on the head you would have been bonked on the head by 18th of the cocoa pods on this page i like coconuts cocoa milk and sugar are the 3 main ingredients used in making milk chocolate sugar usually comes from sugar cane
if you cut down one cane one stalk of sugar cane you will have cut down one ninth of the sugar canes left on this page terms the fraction 5 twelfths cannot be broken down or reduced any further do you know of any number that you can divide 5 and 12 both by other than one
there isn t another number so that tells us that that s already simplified in it s lowest terms fractions 7 twelfths the amount left over from 5 twelfths is 7 twelfths 7 twelfths is another fraction that is in it s lowest terms can i divide 7 and 12 by any number other than one
factor here s 110th page one out of the 10 candy bars is unwrapped here 13 twelfths here s a fraction where the top number is larger than the bottom number this is called irregular nope you got the right mixed number almost beginning of not mixed number im
fraction when the numerator is larger than the denominator okay 13 twelfths is really one and 112th whoever made this fraction made more than one candy bar when the top number when the numerator is greater than the denominator it s an improper fraction and it s bigger than one whole
one now we could change that to one and 112th and that would be a mixed number okay number so far in this book we ve learned that the main ingredients in milk chocolate are sugar milk and cocoa
fractions 112th 212th 3 twelfths 4 twelfths 5 twelfths 6 twelfths 7 twelfths 8 twelfths 9 twelfths 10 twelfths 11 twelfths 12 twelfths even 13 twelfths we also did fractions of one half 13rd 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th one ninth and 110th if you want to know what fraction of ingredients are used in making a hershey s milk chocolate bar sorry those fractions are top secret
hey how come you teach us how come you teach us the fractions for math but you won t teach us the fractions for how to make chocolate well i guess the hershey company has that top secret do we re going to use the hershey bars to make some equivalent fractions i m going to give each team a full size hershey bar to use to make this
handle it s not one that s going to go in our mouth okay i do have enough of the smaller ones to pass out later on if we get to that point okay so question thank you thank you i can t let it go we are going to use a at the very end of the class today yes yesterday i know but then we took longer to do our practice that we were doing
all right so you need to have your coach person get a piece of lined paper from your person at the team on i know and it s doing something with improper fractions i think and it s confusing and i don t really know what to do
well the next time we re in the lab together not right this 2nd but next time we re in the lab together i ll look at it with you
put your name on your paper as soon as you get it please and put today s date at the top of the paper be careful of the camera you can move over by
and also at the top of your paper write hershey s fractions and write req so your name today s date hershey s fractions and the eq and i do have an extra pack of the full size hershey bars and those are going to go to one team
just leave this on the table what do we write your name today s date hershey s fractions and the eq please
all right we re going to make a chart on our paper and you can oops i guess it helps if i get a pen up i guess it is showing up the board s not calibrated again
so the 1st column of your chart is going to be a fraction is it a 3 column chart it s just going to be a 2 column chart for right now 2 column yep just a 2 column chart and the 2nd is going to be equivalents
i like that our mathematician s known to make charts with rulers now
that s it yep bless you
it get some help if you need help from your teammates remember this is one that we re handling so it s not going to be consumed i d like the coach person to show how many pieces are in that candy bar by breaking them apart carefully
when you said to let the coach open it had a smile from ear to ear she thought she was getting a treat right now didn t she
11 what whole one whole column that s okay just pick it up and put in on the work table that s one of the reasons we re not going to consume this one okay and who can give me an equivalent fraction for that that they can prove by looking at these pieces
him because there s 12 pieces and they re equal and they re equal sized aren t they case to be the equivalent fraction they have to be equal sized pieces too okay all right you re going to continue the chart in just a minute but for right now flip that paper over to the back
these are going to be thinking and then sharing questions okay question i want you to think about it and put your own answer down and then your team s going to talk about it in a minute ready are there going to be no
one write one whole as a fraction 2 different ways and they have to be 2 different ways than what we just wrote down down you have 30 seconds get 2 of them down we have to just write them down in numbers is doesn t matter to me
part i want the checker person to tell everybody at the team what they wrote go 6 sixths help her fix it have 89 that s right just put a line through it all right let s hear from stop talking
let s hear from whole what fraction did you hear right yes okay let s get another one from
one your team probably has one fraction while they re thinking about it a fraction that is equivalent to one whole has what the same number the same number for the numerator and the
112 twelfths was one wasn t it answer would you rather eat 112th of a candy bar or 11 twelfths write down which one you d rather eat
okay i this is an opinion question you re right this is part an opinion question get an answer down all right time s up
answer give a reason for your answer okay and this team is going to have a problem if this doesn t stay on task for okay
was i was just trying to make sure i was that s all right all right let s hear from . let s hear from did you think that or did you hear someone say 112th or 11 twelfths 11 twelfths why
because rather eat 11 than just eat one rather eat 11 than one would someone is it possible that someone might say 112th yes okay for a different reason right number 3 write one half as a fraction 2 different ways the pieces of candy are on the table for a reason if you need to look at them ago write one half in 2 different ways
fractions that s not going to work probably okay now i want the reader person to share
go share both of them all right let s hear from please 2 fourths and 3 sixths 2 fourths and 3 sixths how many of you heard answers similar to those
very good number 4 when 2 fractions equal each other they are called it write the word
e when i count to 3 everybody say the answer in a whispering voice 23 equivalent we need to teach what a whispering voice sounds like right number 5 look at the candy bar to answer this answer how many pieces would 13rd of the candy bar be
how many pieces would 13rd be
thirds if i took 3 pieces off at a time is that going to give me 3 parts of the whole candy bar it how many pieces would be in 13rd 3 pieces 4 that didn t work out
go now you should have 4 in each section right so the answer would be 4 pieces one write 13rd as a fraction 2 different ways trickier so 13rd
ways 2 equivalent fractions you would you write the answer to this question please i did thank you who s got one that they know 100% for sure is correct
it one i ll come back to you in just a minute here she says this and we re going to figure out if that s true or not true yes what would she have multiplied the numerator and denominator by
331 times 3 is 33 times 3 is 9 she is correct s 3 fifteenths 3 fifteenths 3 fifteenths okay no 3 times what gives us 155 so whatever we do down there we have to do up there
be 55 so 5 fifteenths would be the one to go there g 2 sixths and i have a question okay i ll take your question in just a 2nd says 2 sixths is that equivalent to 13rd one times 2 is 2 and 3 times 2 is 6 there are a lot of answers aren t there
g sit down you said that multiply listen i m sorry question okay what is it
equivalent with halves can you also do odd numbers that you can i m not sure i understand the question well like you can t multiply some things you if it s one right for if you re making a larger fraction you re not going to have one that has a 3 probably
because i did 2 from 2 yeah so you re seeing a pattern there already right yeah okay all right let s keep going number 7 how many pieces would be in 2 thirds of your candy bar 13rd we just did that so how many pieces would be in 2 thirds jot your answer down jot your answer down if you need to separate back into thirds again do that
show me with your fingers how many pieces were 13rd room show me how many pieces were 13rd what are we showing
244 okay 313rd was 4 this is fourths so 13rd is 4 each of those is a 3rd so if 13rd is 4 pieces 2 thirds is
down yes number 88 actually let s skip over that one for right now and let s go back here
task using this chart on the front side of your paper and using the pieces of the candy bar as your model make as many equivalent fractions as you can so put a fraction in the 1st column make the equivalents in the 2nd column
team everybody doesn t have to have the same answers down you have to understand why yours are correct when you write them down okay what doesn t it have to be like possibly made by it has to be made with a candy bar up and they we re taking care of the goals for it as we go along
confused it s thirds because we split the whole candy bar into 3 pieces right so this is a 3rd and that s a 3rd and that s a 3rd right everybody see that 3rd so if we put 13rd is 4th but if we put 2 thirds together it s how many 88 so we re saying 2 thirds is equal to 8 what what are these size pieces
one no what were these size each of these little pieces was how big 12 a 12th so 2 thirds equals 8 twelfths okay chart if you write 2 thirds in the 1st column what can you write in the 2nd column okay you could split it in half right look it
if we split it in half how many twelfths is that is this the i m not even going to answer that question here we started with 4 twelfths equals 13rd and then we did 6 twelfths equals one half all right and you see why the 6 twelfths equals one half
so i m trying to think of okay well she can also manipulate them for you so you can see them down okay so what do we have guys far we got 10 so you re showing 13rd and how many twelfths is 13rd
4 okay cause you can see the 4 pieces in each part right what if you did 2 thirds be 888 what twelfths twelfths does anybody know how many pieces 3 thirds would be
3 thirds one whole twelfths one whole or 12 twelfths there you go in so what do we have so far i m not seeing anything on s paper over there were talking and we have 14th neither one of you has anything down over here
with we started with 4th okay well let s do 14th out okay so split it into fourths see they went ahead because you weren t doing your part well i was trying to think of one okay so if you split it into 4 parts right each one is a 4th right yep so you should have 14th written down on your 1st column
you should have 14th written down in the 1st column how many twelfths are in each of those fourths 33 so the equivalent fraction would be what 33 what a half 3 twelfths you re right but what 3 twelfths twelfths there you go
3 twelfths 14th 3 over 12 what if we did what if we did 2 fourths couldn t we do 2 fourths jot 2 fourths down on the 1st column
there how many twelfths how many twelfths is 2 fourths 6 twelfths 6 twelfths that s also equivalent to something else isn t it can you figure out what about what half about half yeah so we should have 2 fourths 3 twelfths or 2 fourths 6 twelfths one half
this what if we did 3 fourths yeah we already did that one did you do that down write 3 fourths 3 fourths is 9 i didn t know if that was correct look it we had you split it into fourths right yeah okay we said 14th is 33 twelfths you got that
2 fourths is how many twelfths 3 . 6 twelfths 6 twelfths and then 3 fourths is how many twelfths 9 there you go so you should have 9 twelfths next to 3 fourths i think of it as like i did 3 fourths so and add one more to 3 that would make 4 fourths so i basically do the same thing with another fraction like add one to 9 and it would be 10 tenths so that s try another one
what else could he do besides thirds and fourths yes
that without okay take care of those okay what cha need far i only have these and that one that looks good now if there s 10 pieces in the candy bar are you going to be able to split it into tenths no
no 0 i m sorry me for now
okay so now if we what if we split it into we can t do tenths because there s 12 pieces there slide those pieces down here altogether 12 now my friend over here has one half so how many pieces would half of that candy bar be
6 if you get 7 twelfths equals one go so you should have written down one half equals how many twelfths 6 twelfths so if you don t have that one down let s get that one down
do you see that 33 groups of those are these supposed to be not 4 groups thirds now we split it into thirds so how many twelfths are in each 3rd
okay you need to write down 13rd 13rd equals how many twelfths 4 twelfths there you go 0 okay you got that one down
right what if we did 2 thirds write 2 thirds in your 1st column so we re going to put 2 of these groups together right how many twelfths would that be
to 8 twelfths see you re getting this right please not with 4 in each one but 4 groups
one but if we split it into fourths it s each part is one down 14th now how many pieces are in each group go 3 twelfths and each one of these was a 4th right
down how many twelfths is that equivalent to go there s quite a few so get as many as you can a will they always be 12 for this purpose it is yeah
what we had 14th 2 fourths and now we have 3 down and how many twelfths is that 3 fourths there you go you re getting it girls keep going try it in 6 groups now
no sorry i got hung up okay what s the question 112th 112th would be 112th right what s that i don t know another fraction for that
i was right unless i m going to make larger fractions which is not what we re practicing it remember if we want to make larger numbered fractions that are equivalent we can multiply right
numerator and remember whatever we do to the numerator we got to do to the go so 112th is equal to 440 eighths 40 eighths right so we re just going in a different direction that s all fractions can you make mixed numbers if you can
we are going to summarize today with a little maths mansion as promised
and you are expected to solve the problem at the end of the maths mansion today okay so as the person disposes of the mathematical material i would like you to pick up a piece of scrap paper for each person your answer to the maths mansion question is going to be written on the scrap paper and turned in that yeah so as soon as you get your scrap paper you re going to want to put it on a clipboard and move yourself
sir i haven t decided yet
you will you know you re stressing yourself out fine you were doing harder stuff than this on successmaker the other day start gentlemen put your name on the back of your paper now you need to apologize to the person you were just talking to now who were you talking to
huh all right so put your name on your paper mansion that s not it
sorry it s up high there it is
is put your name on your paper excuse me
you 0 that sounds like something your teacher has said that for once just for once there is no sound of that sad man interrupting my program
students okay guys so we re going to work on patterns and decimal division
right let s go to page 188 just to review quickly i m going to get you to press the button for me so this can turn off
thank you press it 2 times okay thank you yes all right you all remember yesterday we were talking about follow the decimal point that we re going to do some examples of following the decimal and we ll go with number 5
we ll start with number 5 on 189 me yes all right yes i wanted to do this problem okay i m going to i m going to write it up and then i ll just call on you okay number 5 what do you see in number 5 21 okay 7 times 3 equals 21
okay everyone already knows that 7 times 3 equals 21 correct yes yes okay now we follow that decimal point now we talked about with whole numbers there is a decimal point in the number isn t there yes that we don t usually write when we re writing whole numbers and when we re dealing with whole numbers point behind the 7 okay so there is a decimal point right there right
yes and in the number 3 where s the decimal point behind the 3 there s a decimal point here and in the number 21 behind the one there s a decimal point there okay now the 2nd the 2nd part of this problem says 7 tenths times 3 right make sure that you write this please 7 tenths times 3 equals
now if you re following the decimal point we can see that the decimal point is in the whole number 7 has moved hasn t it in 7 tenths it has moved one place to the right to the left correct so in patterns and multiplication they want you to understand that your answer is still going to be the same correct
what one place to the left left in your answer so 7 tenths times 3 is now i m sorry 7 times 3 is 21 so 7 tenths times 3 is what this is 2 and one tenths right
or written 2 one but 2 and one tenths all right does everybody see that pattern yes does everybody see that pattern all right now the next one says 7 hundredths times 3 yes yes 7 hundredths times 3 follow the decimal point okay so the decimal point was here in the whole number 7 behind the number 7 right
and then it moved one place to the left and it was 7 tenths right now it moves one more place to the left and now we have 7 hundredths so in our answer the decimal point will move also the same number of decimal places correct right so since now the decimal point from here it has gone from here it moved one place here now 2 places here correct
so now it s going to move 2 places in our answer so now the decimal point has gone from here moved one place again and one place again to here so now our answer for this is 21 hundredths correct yeah 21 hundredths does that make sense to everyone yes does everyone see the pattern yes all right so that s patterns
but let s say what if i can t really see that pattern d multiply okay so i could just set up my multiplication problem if this is 7 tenths times 3 but i can t see this pattern
move so i would just set up my problem 0 and 7 tenths times 3 all right now we know that 3 times 7 is still 21 right 3 times 7 is 21 but we can we can multiply it out like this 3 times 7 is 21 and then write your one and carry your 2 right
3 times 0 is 00 and then you have a 2 there yes all right now just like we learned last week just count the decimal places
one so one decimal place and my decimal goes here 2 and one tenths so if i could not see the pattern here is it okay to still just multiply it and get the answer taken is there anyone who s having any trouble with that at all
that yes all right we re going to skip to let s do number 7 then let s do number 7 because everybody might not know 26 times 4 off the top of their head everybody might not know that one although you might know 25 times 4
100 so 26 times 4 is 104 it all right so 26 times 4 go ahead and write 26 times 4 equals 104 26 times 4 equals 104 and once again we re going to follow that decimal point
so the 1st problem is 2 and 6 tenths times 4 and what does that equal don t say it out loud just thinking just for a moment correct now right here the decimal point is right there originally correct in the whole number 26
decimal all right the decimal point is going 0 move one place to the left and that s how we get 2 and 6 tenths correct yeah so that means if you look here at our answer the answer is going to still be 104 but the decimal point is going to do what
move move what ne space to the left one place to the left 10 and what 4 tenths 10 and 4 tenths here so you all can see that 2 and 6 tenths times 4 10 and 4 tenths just watching what the decimal point watching the decimal point move decimal point moves one place to the left here one place to the left here since it moved one place to the left here it s also going to be one place to the left in your answer
everybody got that yes now what if i could not see that alternative you can just multiply it like this right if you can t see the pattern then go ahead and multiply it 24 all right and i write my 4 and carry the 2 all right and 4 times 2 is 8 +2 10
okay there s my 104 and how many decimal places do you see here one only one so i need one decimal place also in my answer 10 and 4 tenths 10 and 4 tenths i got the same answer both ways didn t i
yes since your math class is not meeting do you have math you re working on not
if you re following along with us then i mean that s fine if you re following along with us i would take advantage of the time though and do accelerated math okay now the next one says 26 hundredths times 4 correct yes 26 hundredths times 4
done from the initial problem 26 times 4 the decimal point has now moved how many places 22 places to the left 2 places to the left left is that what you re writing that it s moved 2 places to the left
okay now since the decimal point moved 2 places to the left from the original problem and my original answer was 104 that means that in my in my answer or in my product the decimal point must also move what 2 places 2 places to the left left
so my answer here is one and 4 hundredths one and 4 hundredths right i see that any questions
so let s look at number 8 look at number 8 you re okay to walk it s okay 0 okay all right let s look at the division number 8 everyone yes all right what does that problem say
50 divided by 25 equals 2 okay 50 divided by 25 equals 2 all right so now instead of multiplication this is division correct
yes okay now let s say if that was a related multiplication problem what multiplication problem give me a related multiplication fact for 50 divided by 25 equals 2 25 times times 2 equals 50
very good okay so he said 25 i m going to draw a line here 25 times 2 equals 50 you all agree that that is a related multiplication fact for this division fact yeah what is another related multiplication fact for this division fact
52 times 25 equals 50 j okay does everyone agree that this is a related multiplication fact for this division fact
yes okay now we have next 5 divided by 2 and 5 tenths and they ve written 5 with a decimal point
answer okay now let s look at the differences that we see here we see 50 divided by 25 equals 2 right now we ve got 5 divided by 2 and 5 tenths yet however what do you notice between these 2
2 anybody at this group can tell me something you notice about these 2 division problems what they have something in common but what is it
a the decimal the decimal behind the 50 the imaginary decimal he s saying here is behind the 50 and here of course it s behind the 25 right decimal so what what do you notice about these 2 problems they re equal he said they re equal yeah you all agree with that
think they both have decimals but in different spots both of these have decimals but in what think about what happened to the decimal in each of these in the dividend and in the divisor what happened to the decimal point in each of these cause says that these are equal as in they re the same and you all agreed with that
d the decimal it moved one place over the decimal point moved one place to the left in both of them in both the dividend and in the divisor right yes okay the decimal point did the exact same thing in the dividend and in the divisor divisor correct the decimal point did the exact same thing didn t it
right so one place to the left each time correct all right now if we think about for example like we related these multiplication facts to this let s relate let s look at the related multiplication facts for a 2nd without the product what is well actually we need to go ahead and try to figure out this answer 1st you know
what is the answer for 5 divided by 2 and 5 tenths 2 i see one person that doesn t agree with 202 people that don t agree with 2 that you think it s do you agree with 2
yes the division decimal so you would have to move the decimal to the right to the right then you can divide so it s going to be equal and also he said it s going to be equal and all of you agree with 2
also if i if i change the same thing in each one i really change nothing correct yeah which explains why my quotient or my answer would be the same if i change the same thing i change the i ve done the exact same thing to both the dividend and the divisor then my answer is still the same
problem let s look at this as a problem that we would work out correct yes we know that 1st that 1st number represents the dividend it always goes up under the bracket okay now in our divisor we cannot have a what decimal all right so we would remove this decimal basically by multiplying by 10
that s how we get rid of that decimal but we re going to just take our decimal and move it one place to the multiple students right right this is why you all worked on in class the patterns remember the patterns with the zeros when you were multiplying by 10 100 1000 and all of that so that you would know understand what happens when you multiply by 10 time so if i want that decimal point to move one place to the right i need to multiply by 10
so now my decimal point is here isn t it 25 notice that it is back to the same original problem isn t it and that s why i end up with the same answer of 2 all over again
now give me related multiplication facts for this division fact related multiplication facts you re seeing here for this division fact
please okay right here i ve got 5 divided by 2 and 5 tenths here i need a related multiplication fact for this my dividend becomes my product doesn t it right
so i shouldn t i shouldn t hear you saying 51st
y times 5 does it it i would say you need to check that on your paper
and also you need to look at the related multiplication facts that we did for the top order so if 50 is the product here that means 5 should be the product correct everyone yes shouldn t 5 be the product
and also since 55 which i m saying 5 is 5 and 0 tenths but 5 since 5 is the dividend that means that 5 is the product fact we ve already done it i m going to draw a squiggly line here because that matches with that we need a related multiplication sentence that matches with this
g 2.5 times 2 5 you could go with that we can go with that
i think about the commutative property that i learned back in 3rd grade 25 times 2 and then all i do is flop flip flop the factors and i get 2 times 25
here 2 times did i just say to flop the factors product can my product become the factor
no so like here i ve got 25 times 2 equals 50 no your product can t become one of your factors so we have 2 and 5 tenths times 2 is 5 right give me a related multiplication fact give me another fact that belongs in that family actually that s not 25 though what is that
2.5 equals what there your product should not change should it change so this is matching with that another squiggly line there right what 50 divided by times 25
50 hundredths divided by 25 hundredths right 50 hundredths divided by 25 hundredths equals now look at what we see here again pattern what do we notice about our original problem and this problem
what do we notice what do we see about this decimal point see the decimal is moving over to the left how many places 22 places does everybody agree the decimal point has moved 2 places in the dividend and in the divisor
right so since we ve changed the same thing in both the dividend and the divisor we have really changed what nothing nothing we ve changed nothing nothing it s the same which means that the quotient is the same so the answer is what
2 now i can set up my problem 0 and 25 hundredths into 0 and 50 hundredths we know that we cannot have a decimal in the in the divisor right using our math vocabulary
j yes all right now so really in order to get rid of this decimal point i need to multiply by 100 now i can take each of these numbers and multiply by 100 but if i remember back in the last chapter when we were doing patterns multiplying by 10 multiplying by 100 multiplying by 1000 you all remember that yes
when you multiply by 100 that means your decimal point moves 2 places 2 places to the right so i can use mental math to multiply this decimal by 100 that just means i move this decimal .2 places to the right and now my decimal point is here and i move it 2 places to the right here and my decimal point is here
as long as i do the same thing in the dividend and in the divisor it is okay you can t multiply the divisor by 100 and don t multiply the dividend by 100 that but if you multiply both by 100 you still have an equal problem
it well look now that i ve multiplied it by 100 i am back to my original problem which explains why my quotient is the same same you just got 50 divided by 25 and that s 2 right 2 times 25 50 and we can see why that is 222 yes can everybody see this pattern in decimal division
yes does anybody need more clarification on the pattern division okay now let s look at homework with our eyes and our our eyes and our key work
it is a check if i see you so you understand i have said what you re supposed to be doing those of you who are not meeting in your own math class today all right that you may participate with us or you may do your own math but that s it say are you going to do are we going to do see that in front of you
no but well i don t know where yours is none of you got your papers back yes 0 okay now your paper says you can use multiplication and patterns to help you with decimal division
right yes we see here multiplication 25 times 5 is 1352 and 7 tenths times 5 is 13 and 5 tenths 27 hundredths times 5 us one and 35 hundredths does everyone see how the decimal point has moved
yes as the number of decimal places in the factor increases the number of decimal places in the product increases now division on the division side got a dividend divided by a divisor equals a quotient correct i want everybody to make sure that you see the vocabulary that they re showing you right
like that excuse me back to the multiplication again you got factor times factor equals product correct yes everybody say factor times factor equals product factor times factor equals product okay factor times factor always equals product this is the same thing even when you re doing decimals when you re doing decimal division it s still the same thing it s still factor times factor equals product just because it s a decimal doesn t change that does it
now division dividend divided by divisor equals quotient just because there s a decimal point doesn t change anything it s still dividend divided by divisor equals quotient so we have 135 divided by 27 equals 5 13 and 5 tenths divided by 2 and 7 tenths equals 5 we see the decimal point move one place to the left correct all right and then we see one and 35 hundredths divided by 27 hundredths equals 5 also
that and it moved in both the dividend and in the divisor that if the number of decimal places in the dividend and the divisor increased equally then the quotient will remain the same key word equally equally highlighted or underlined the key word is equally
again if the number of decimal places in the dividend and the divisor increased equally then the quotient will remain the same right complete each multiplication pattern and each division pattern
we ve got 9 times 4 equals 369 times 9 tenths times 4 equals 3 and 6 tenths so what is 9 hundredths times 4 36 hundredths excuse me excuse me
problem but i believe are you checking along with us me are you checking along with us be all right 9 hundredths times 4 is
how do you read that number how do you read the number i m calling on you for an answer today please huh again 36 hundredths 36 hundredths everybody got that
there it is on the board so that is what your answer should look like 36 hundredths any questions yes it can be written just like that that because if this is money that s like saying i have ¢36
fine so either way it s still 0 right all right still on number one related division facts 36 divided by 9 is 43 and 6 tenths divided by 9 tenths is 4 36 hundredths divided by 9 hundredths is
444 are there any questions that do you understand that 451 and 5 tenths times 3 equals 45
35 say it again wait and that is a check for us having to wait on off task behavior
s 45 hundredths 45 hundredths 45 hundredths any questions and you have that written right on your paper
next 45 divided by 15 equals 34 and 5 tenths divided by one and 5 tenths equals 3 45 hundredths divided by 15 hundredths equals
j you all do see in the division that the number of decimal places in the dividend and the divisor increased equally therefore the quotient was the same yes all right number 3 32 times 6 is 1923 and 23 and 2 tenths times 6 equals
19 and 2 hundredths 19 and say it again 2 hundredths is it like this this is 2 hundredths 19 and which is 19 and 2 what tenths tenths 19 and 2 tenths good 32 hundredths times 6 is
wait no sit there for a moment on that side please say it again one and 92 hundredths one and 92 hundredths one and 92 hundredths any questions j 192 divided by 32 equals 6
19 and 2 tenths divided by 3 and 2 tenths equals we know that the number of decimal places in the dividend and the divisor increased equally so the answer there is what 66 the quotient is the same right yes one and 92 hundredths divided by 32 hundredths equals 6
esp you answered before i even called her name no number 4 coming your way 1753 and 5 tenths times 5 equals 17 17 and 5 tenths very good 17 and 5 tenths
35 hundredths times 5 equals it equals 50 stay focused listen again one.75 which is one and 75 hundredths you were on the wrong one yes
wrong 175 divided by 35 equals 5 17 and 5 tenths divided by 3 and 5 tenths equals 551 and 75 hundredths divided by 35 hundredths equals
g you saved him yes g 28 times 3 equals stay over there please stay over there please at the door you i m going back to 28 times 3 equals 84 84 very good
s 8 i want you to say it correctly 8 and 4 tenths 28 hundredths times 3 equals
8.4 tenths 08.4 tenths i need 28 hundredths times 3 28 hundredths times 3 what 84 hundredths 84 hundredths very good on to the last one number 6 42 times 7 is
i need 42 times 7 400 is that why she s saying that then okay i m sorry related division say 84 divided by 28 equals 33 very good 84 tenths divided by 2 and 8 tenths equals 33 it s the same
84 hundredths divided by 28 hundredths equals 3 okay everybody together please for number 6 29.4 29.4 tenths no not 29.4 tenths 29 and 4 tenths okay please 42 hundredths times 72 and 94 hundredths 2 and 94 hundredths and all together for the last one 294 divided by 42
7 shh it s just 7 actually just 7 okay 29 and 4 tenths divided by 4 and 2 tenths 7 and 2 and 94 hundredths divided by 42 hundredths 77 how did we do at the top
me it s just like math class regular math class okay i m going to pass out to you 2 sets of factor pairs okay and you can choose a partner and you and your partner are going to have a quick and talk about i want you to solve them and then see if there s any relationship between the factor pairs okay
so you re going to solve them and any relationship between the factor pairs t you already have a partner
partners wait a minute how is your partner d which one did i give you all right here s the other one
you 2 need 2 which one did miss r give you
see here you go 2 we figured this one already out back you can solve them back
okay i see a lot of people solving them which is great i m going to let you solve for about 30 more seconds and then i want to hear you talk about any relationships that you see between the factor pairs
okay was it a late bus were you guys behaving yeah we had to go to for some people 0 so they weren t behaving huh
good all right me can you show turn around so i can see your face
sets chalk there it is right i gave 3 times 4 and then i gave you 30 times 40 4 anybody want to tell me the product of 3 times 4
d 1212 did you and come up with what the product 12 what the product is of 30 times 4 yes yeah so what did you come up with 120 okay then 0 there goes the paper it all right the next one i gave you was 5 times 6 and then 50 times 6
can anybody tell me the product of 5 times 6 k 3030 and the product of 50 times 6 right i like it i love it i want some more of it okay so anybody have any thoughts about the relationship between these factors and the fact they re pairs and their products
thoughts did they see any relationship between them so this one and this one and this one to this one
k they have the same multiples but they have the same she said multiples
what one and 21 and 2 is i think what needs to think about is they are multiples but there s something else and that s one and 2 is not the multiple you re thinking of a 12 the multiple is 12
if i skip count by 12 here i will land on 120 yesterday these are multiples of 10
remember i get so excited when i get a problem like this on a math paper because 000 yeah yeah i know a smaller one that can help me figure out the product for this pretty large one and it s because the factor pairs have something in common
you kids like to say 0 miss h you just add a 0 that s all you did right you like to say hey miss h this is 5 times 6 is 30 and so you added a 0 here so you just added a 0 over here and it works
0 you re not just adding a 0 boys and girls
103 times 4 if you add a 0 to 3 you multiply it by 10 and you get 30 and if you multiply one of the factor pairs by 10 you have to also multiple the product by 10 and you ll get the answer okay
10 today you re going to be working with some word problems that tests out this theory because looking at your faces 0 miss h i don t know i don t know if that always works or miss h i just want to just keep adding the 0 i understand the add the 0 concept because it s efficient it s quick but i want you to understand what is the math behind you adding your 0 to your products okay
well before we quickly move into math groups i m going to have a 10 minute skills and drills session okay multiplication but before we do that i want to see if anybody can come up with another factor pair set that does the same thing as this add the 0 concept
anybody know any one of them another factor pair set that has this multiple of 10 mathematical concept that you think might work k 20 times 5 but what are you going to start with 2 times 5 so 2 times 5 equals 10 and so what s 20 times 5
100 somebody else want to try g 6 times 3 equals 18 1860 time 3 equals 180
60 times 3 equals 180 very good okay i m going to give you a preview to your exit question at the end while you re working today i want you to think about why does that knowing this multiple of 10 rule how does that help us become better multipliers how does knowing this multiple of 10 rule help us become efficient and better multipliers
okay now in my plans i wrote down page 42 i just want to make sure unit 3 page 42 perfect okay please turn to unit 3 page 42
10 minute skills and drills god bless you no huh 0 you had to go get a checkup
in take a seat take a seat probably over here 42 many of you are not going to need 10 minutes
5 even better if we just need 5
yeah good boy okay thumbs up
okay what s 8 times 68 times 6
80 times 6 480 480 okay all right how s it going to i put the work hard get smart up on the board pencil if you can t get a pencil there s some pencils in my drawer okay
there i would like to see with me 1st and back table and you guys are all going to get an orange book okay you guys are going to do some more skills and drills practice
n and you guys are going to work on page 43 and i think there s a 43 and a 44 did i give you how come it says 2 of 2 on there 0
43 give me 2 seconds you re supposed to get an orange book
okay so people if you are in computation or independent practice i want you on page 43 if you finish before i call your group you need to do page 41
all right so for fast finishers fast finishers if you are in skills and drills that means over here you know that i don t remember the page
page there it is page 215 numbers one through 20 page 215 number one through 20
journal s group i hope you re back there with your spiral books group i need to sharpen my pencil you need to go to another classroom and sharpen
go to who else one k 0 are you sick buddy bye feel better
okay you know my rule about group unless you re bleeding that s the only way you interrupt me all right 1st we re going to start talking about some words that indicate multiplication in a word problem so let me get a marker
what are some words that indicate multiplication that means shows multiplication it let s you know that you re multiplying when you look at your word problem be what does it sound like like in a multiplication word problem in each group very good
so sometimes the word group is in a multiplication word problem right okay open up your pages to page 43
i want you to go on the top right hand corner of page 43 and let s do some quick multiplication practice okay
go let s try 23 times 9 9 not solve it in your head write it down instead and do it did you go and get a pencil sharpened in miss k s room
problems miss h is going to tell you something that i ve been telling you since september learn your facts
them 23 times 9 wants to try it this way
that because if 2 times 9 equals 18 then 20 times 9 is 180 g he used a smaller factor pair inside the large to help him with the larger one left 33 what s 3 times 9
2710 +one 207 207 so this group from now on mister g and any time i see you do the traditional you need to double check with the cluster okay
me yeah i hear you good all right so we ve got a little bit of multiplication practice in we ve said that if i see the word each and sometimes if i see the word group i might be thinking that i need to multiply
problem page 41 43 i hope you re talking about math
board okay miss santos sells bags of oranges in her grocery store oranges i m going to make them right here bags of oranges
go do like my bags beautiful they look like honey jars they look like honey jars there you go right there are 4 oranges in each bag bags how many oranges did david buy
i want you to read that back to yourself i want you to underline any vocabulary words that make you think 0 this is multiplication and then i would like to tell me what to do with my pictures
n you re going to have to sit over there with that group when you get yourself all set finished okay so because i don t understand i don t think you re talking about math all right any words that are underlined that you think tell me that i should be multiplying each it said each right
picture hi me because this is the we said is at the end of the word problem it tells us what
does it tell us it was multiplication it tells us what to do it how many oranges david bought it tells you how many oranges david bought did it tell you something else
the . label the label right my label better be what right so tell me what to do now to my picture what should i do to these pictures do sell them to these pictures i should sell them no
no to my pictures got all 6 so yeah he has his 6 bags but what should i do to my picture 4 oranges in each bag 0 okay there they go 123412341234 does this seem repetitive to you what is miss h repeating every time she goes to each bag
you keep putting 4 oranges in them i keep on putting 4 oranges in each bag over and over again total but that means i m going over and over and over again no because it s you re going to skip it and go to the next one
okay all right so if i m repeating this 4 over and over and over and over again i am multiplying boys and girls okay over and over and over again and you need to spit that gum out
plan how are you going to solve this word problem
facts you are going to go back to seats you may draw what miss h did you need to show me numbers and pictures on this page okay you we can work together i think you don t need help knowing 4 times 6 and the other one is not that bad
do me a favor move somebody out of apple and can i have the people who were near the calculator move you guys yeah very good you can i please have and and
where did all of this stuff come from miss h put it there put these back because we didn t put it away from tutoring yesterday
books oops sweetie you re going to have to stay here for a 2nd for today stay there for today
before i start group do you have a question you need to ask me no are you sure because your paper looks empty you finished 42 okay you re supposed to go to 41 if you finished
no don t do that to she hasn t done her math yet question hello everybody hello hell miss h
right yep i want to talk a little bit about clustering yes because clusters i know you some of you are very efficient multipliers but what i m not seeing on your papers are ways to double check your multiplication okay
so here is 18 times 9 all right i know you boys are going to help me figure out this real fast good and 9 times one is 9 16 very good you think so
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 very good now look at this 18 can the see me so 18 times 9 in a cluster all right we re going the other way the opposite direction . going straight across yeah
j the bigger one the bigger fa what s this word of . 84 no
1st because 10 is going to take off the biggest amount from that 18 you re going to use up the most 10 times 9 and then we get to practice that multiplication where we talked about earlier right what s one times 99 and then multiply it by 10 and it s 90
very good so i cover up the 0 and then times it then you get the same number then you swoop the 0 over well you were here for our conversation this morning right doing multi add a 0 no we re not just adding a 0 we re multiplying it by 10 all right
t 7272 and now we need to add them up correct 90 +72 equals 162 okay so from now on from now on from on and from now on i want to see you double checking with the cluster okay
4 because you can show me hey miss h i can do it this way and i can do it this way all right open up your books to page 41
okay 1st i want you boys to read it and i want you to underline any words in that word problem that tell you that you should multiply okay
beautiful nice job d i can t see miss h doesn t have her glasses i left those in the other car what how many bags of oranges did he buy in total right okay so here s miss h i m going to pretend to be david
you re going to be david i m david i m david he s david i m still david come on david i could see i could see on the other side all right do doggy i said the doggy i know i thought of that last night in the shower i thought that was so funny all right teach me how to do it
bag why because in each bag okay so there you go you what am i repeating over and over and over again
what 44444444 all right mean that s multiplying
i m repeating 4 over and over and over and over and over again not like division we ve been talking about earlier in the week it sort of is like the answer of a multiplication problem and you have to like figure out the multiple you have to figure out the missing factor yeah so you start with the multiple and then you figure out the missing factor all right boys i know you re going to eat this page up you re going to eat it for dinner i know it
what i do want you to do when you go back to your tables is that i want you to please make sure that you show me in pictures and words so you might you could take my drawing for the 1st one okay when you finish this word problem go to page 43 and i want you to look at what you did on page 42 to help you answer the questions on page 43
right and watch out for number 6 because this time we didn t multiply it by 10 we multiplied it by a 100 and see if that changes the answer at all okay
it 1200 very good did you do page 43
didn t for a 2nd can i please have i need those girls everybody that started on page 43 and 41 i need to see you except for if you re over there i m sorry you ll see me the last i have a whole 5 minutes for you guys at the end
if you started on page 42 43 or 41 no you didn t start on page 43 or 41 you started in group so sit sit going good that s not bad you got it right
good one thing that s missing girls is this the groups you haven t shown me in pictures that s one but you didn t know to do that but i don t see your double check right division you could divide you could do 4 divided by no 24 divided by 4
way 24 divided by 6 is 4 way for number 2 you can do 240 divided by . divided by 40 equals i heard miss h say 6 equals 40
question how does this multiple of 10 rule help you become a better multiplier it s kind of like if you did 8 times 6 miss h and would be 48 and then 80 times 6 would 480
efficient because it s easily you will learn this in like and learn it in and when you get in higher grades it will be easier for you to do others of this stuff with 10s can you share that out to the class for me when it s time for share out why that s why they teach you the 10s when you re a kid because it s easier to count by 10s
it easier to count by 10s 10s and 20 is doing it right now she goes 10203040 it s easy to count by 10s right
so if you think it s easy to count by 10 it s very easy to multiply by 10 right so the number just moves from 24 to 40 okay and you just multiply by 10 240 2400
right next time however i want a picture a picture okay today what did you notice about the solution to page 43 related they re not factors of 10 up they are multiples of 10 all right
because if you skip counted by 56 times you would land on 300 so 300 is the multiple but these 2 are the guys you would skip count by to land on it
you would move this to 10 you can use the 50 for 10 and the 6 for ones okay so you say 50 times 6 or 5 times 6 and you ll get 30 and then multiply that number by 10 and you ll get 300 and it s the same right if you move them around
400 i ve got 3 times 400 200 all right so let s see 3 times 4 30 times 4
4 what has changed in these factors pairs 3s what happened to this 3 time you have a 0 and then another 0 what did miss h say about adding 0 doing you re multiplying you re multiplying the 10s by 10s 10s so you re taking 3 and multiplying it by 10 and getting 30 and then taking 30 and multiplying that by 10 and getting 300
so if you did this with the factor pair here what do you have to do with the products over here
it was 12 and then 3 30 times 4 is 120 and then this one would be . 1200 right because 0 s over here there are 2 of them right so you multiplied it this time by 100 and you got 1200
1200 you may borrow this card for your answer for number 6 okay
stuck did you do page 43 it all right
so this time you multiplied it by 100 and look how many zeros you added on you added on 2 right zeros if you multiply by 1000 you re going to add on 3 more zeros problem we re going to share out all the good math work that we ve done today
i m going to go check in with that group seats what happened
led no i don t have an eraser so you didn t ask these 4 girls here to help you that seems like a waste of time my friend you know when you told us to do one page out of our packet my mom didn t believe me
because i need i told her that but she said i told her you said don t go over it packet today s thursday okay tomorrow it s due tomorrow don t argue with your mother about homework time what about the chapter with the division problems 0 i love it
k okay finishing up that last piece try he s
me look miss h left hand you all are funny so guess what last night i came up with a new song you know how i have my beyonce song when i told you to like find me evidence
that you know my beyonce song right 0 yeah i made up another one last night right sing it it so sometimes you might hear me say that belt 0 my gosh miss h you couldn t see like the chalk there don t do that to me
it you put it here it s not my fault what did we learn today i want you to turn to a partner and tell them one thing that you learned today in math class
there seriously all right i know i was being funny about the teach me how to do it but tell your math partner one thing you learned in math today
later okay back to your seat mister time so your mom can see it j nobody wants to talk to you i you all the time because when it s here i love it
all right so one thing you learned today i learned if you multiply by 10 you ll figure out a number that s in all right you can have a higher product when you multiply by 10 math that you should double check your work
up because the 2nd problem like i thought it was like 0 all right doesn t it feel good to pass in something you know you ve double checked and it s right so miss has no choice but to give you a 3 or a 4 i m trying to tell you double checking is very important
it okay 3 times 400 i think put it the best
he said miss h when i can multiply by 10 i can figure out a higher product okay are we multiplying by 10 here yes what are the somebody tell me what are we multiplying by
m a 100 we re multiplying by a 100 but thinks the rule still applies
d 22201200 somebody give me the breakdown what are the smaller pieces that are inside this larger factor multiplication sentence i 3 times 43 times 4 is here 41212 another one
40 we look what s in here k we have 3 times 4 that s in there to help us solve that one in 30 times 4 good equals 12120 the rule still applies
job the rule still applies even if you multiply by 100 okay this time instead of adding 10 or multiplying it by 10 you are now multiplying it by 100 and you add you add 2 zeros today we are done
a a what 2 okay so i leave the 9 the same and then write a 2 and keep the 8 a 00 you re going to do this side by yourself
5 it s not 1000s value worth 500 you just told me it was 1000s how much is it worth
me the 1000s so write how much the 5 is worth
that s a comma right make it look like a comma all right now do the all right the rest of you come back to your seat
i i no you don t you have 20 seconds to be back at your desk really said it s it already did
all right so i have to re start my computer to . make it not turn red right yes so you re going to be really patient yes
down go ahead and put your dmr in your desk glue it your notebook and take out your math interactive notebook and open to a new page
what did you need what did you need don t we got to nope not today because i m busy right
yep she s busy i know you didn t shove that in your desk right because you glued it in your notebook yes yep am i going to be in trouble because i homework no
do before i start teaching while my computer is booting up i want you all to do a circle map on . on fractions
e . it . not not that it gives information r it . it helps you get ideas so i want to see all the ideas that you already have about fractions
up you don t need anything but a pencil what did i just say we don t need anything but our pencil what did i just say you don t need anything but a pencil all right stand up up your chair is pushed in yes
109876 here 432 here
one here i there go s who s your partner who is yep right here i love how you guys you can you have 4 minutes go
circle circle love it circle shh
go 0 i love how wrote fractions in the middle and put a circle around it and then he s going to write i know you re going to erase that circle because remember we talked about that can you fit all of your words in this tiny circle
b yes this place is too crowded well move there s an empty table words do all the words and then the last thing you do is draw the big giant circle okay
you just draw the words write all the words all the words just like you re doing yes can we do yes write some descriptive words though i don t know shh
s that s exactly what i want you to do do that s exactly what i want you to do 0 i 0 point . teacher b can t you multiply denominator we re not there yet
no so don t . don t write something we haven t done have a seat here tape
here this is your table i have to get my math you don t need anything sweetie here i don t know why she has her math notebook because i didn t want you to have your math notebook 2
8 he has not written anything he needs to write what do you call the thing with the simplify shh where s the common shh
fractions i don t . i don t have any i don t have any i m doing whole group but i m getting okay you re good
right now
huh do we put . thumbs up if you want 2 more minutes wow you must have a lot of information to tell me
it i was asked if you could draw pictures and the answer was yes have we ever learned anything about these common factors we learned about greatest common multiple and least common factor
i don t i didn t do that
okay well 2 of those don t make sense 45 is shaded in so we got 21 it would be 71 shaded in
it s it s 21 it s like hey teacher b b come here teacher b yes is it equivalent shh equivalent and equal the same
no write this down can we have 50 seconds eyeballs 50 seconds 432
eyeballs one are give me 3 things which your group has
on okay so i was a little confused right yes and then you did a circle yes yeah and then you didn t do the 2nd circle right yes okay good because you did it last after the whole thing was done
things and unit fractions okay chain simplify and what was the last one group i m sorry
improper l c m l c m and g c m g c m g c f s group shh equivalent equivalent what else
got simplified tell me what simplify means simplify means . shh what does simplify mean least common multiple not least common multiple that s something but what does simplify mean it what is simplify to make it you all right do you have anything else that s different
shh 321 j mixed number off set fraction mixed hold on
number off set fractions set model and a number line fraction a number line fraction 0 i like that number line perfect s group did you have anything different shh yeah a half okay so she just wrote a half but maybe could you do a half equals what
one i mean we wrote a half a half equals what give me something that s equivalent to one half 4 eighths 4 eighths 3 sixths 4 eighths or 3 sixths or 8 fourths perfect do you have anything else different nope
no fractions can be turned into no fractions can be turned from improper fractions to mixed fractions 0 so he s saying that an improper fraction can be turned into a mixed number and a mixed number can be turned into an improper
different i got shh 3 l c f guys least common multiple and g c f is greatest common factor all right do you have anything different
1st problem 0 we can do word problems i said not fair they have not shared yet r denominator and numerator numerator and hold on
fast numerator denominator and we got . we got one comparing fractions comparing hold on
if you re comparing you can use this symbol this symbol or this symbol excellent adding fractions adding fractions yes you can add you can subtract minus we re not at dividing or multiplying yet 2 do we have anything else different area model 0 area model love it
mode no fair anything else yes yet fractions s group do you have anything different no model is it set area or number line set model excellent which one looks like arrays
area no composite area arrays
beautiful can you write your name on it somewhat small and then put a giant circle around it last yes
are i want one person to bring the paper to my back table and make a pile and then everybody else clean up your area and go back to your desk
go back table 109 are we supposed to 8 back table 7 to do what 6
543 put our math 2
ready she has her notebook on her desk she has a pencil out and she s facing the smartboard i am going to teach today about adding fractions but they don t just have a adding fractions brain they have an adding and subtracting i m going to teach subtracting tomorrow so i figured we d just watch the whole thing today
ready a he didn t raise his hand b 4 people are doing stuff in their desk are now we have everyone s attention ready shh are those pies for the bake sale
pie dear tim and moby i want to know how to add and subtract fractions joshua well pies are perfect for talking about fractions as you can see this is one pie this is one part of one whole or one over one in fraction form
pieces each piece is one divided by 2 or one half of the whole one half +one half equals 2 halves or one whole in a fraction the numbers that makes the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator denominator the denominator tells us how many pieces make up one whole the numerator tells us how many of those pieces we re dealing with
right it s 2 in this case is a common denominator shared by both fractions when you add fractions with the same denominator you add the numerators while the denominator stays the same each of these pieces is one divided by 4 or 14th of the whole we can see that 14th +14th equals 2 fourths or one half
so let s say we want to add 14th of this pie to one half of another one pie 14th and one half are fractions with different denominators to add them can we add 14th +one half no
tell me why the numerator is i m sorry the denominators are not the same good we need to find the l c d or lowest common denominator we re getting there we re getting there the lowest common multiple of the fraction s denominators for our denominators 2 and 4 that number s 4 so we d want to write all of our fractions as fractions of 4
14th already is and as we saw before one half and 2 fourths are really the same thing now that we have a common denominator we can just add our numerators 2 fourths +14th equals 3 fourths well subtraction is the same idea as long as we have a common denominator it s just a matter of subtracting our numerators
if we shh don t have a common denominator we d find the lowest common denominator and re write our fractions to match example last year moby s pies were the highest selling items in the bake sale in fact 5 ninths of all the students in our school bought them but the year before only 5 twelfths of the school bought the pies
yet anyway to find out what fraction of students bought the pies the 2nd year but not the 1st year we would subtract 5 twelfths from 5 ninths okay the denominators are 9 and 12 what s the l c d good 36 that s the lowest number that both 9 and 12 multiply into evenly so let s re write our fraction as same thing as let s see
to turn 9 into 36 we need to multiply it by 4 which means we also have to multiply the numerator by 4 and to turn 12 into 36 we multiply by 3 which means we also multiply 5 by 3 answer 5 so between last year and the year before your sales increased by 530 sixths all these pies we cut up
them 0 . 0 my god ow this is your fault for making so many pies ugh all right so what did you think easy good
go back to your desks all right are you ready okay so today i warned you we were going to do a lot of me showing you you doing so teacher modeling means i do
do so you do you need to write anything when i m doing it on the board 13 sixths +2 sixths can you help me no i need to change it to make it look like this +2 sixths and it says the bottom numbers are the same 5 sixths bottom number s the same
so we add the top numbers that equal 5 sixths good it says with denominators that are the same do i need to simplify no okay so now with this one i m going to write 5 eighths that doesn t really look like a 5 +2 eighths what s my answer girl all right so i m doing 14th +2 fourths what s my answer
fourths excellent 4 sevenths +2 sevenths what s my answer 6 sevenths good girl last 15 ninths +2 ninths
 . stop the denominator if they re the same all i do is leave it the same all i do is leave it the same right now i add the top numbers together so 5 +2 is 77711 teacher modeling 0
ractice there s only 5 of them and what did the last thing take me what 30 seconds nice handwriting yes can you write f and then the problem
problem love how you re using your best handwriting sit right here because s not here today sit by me
sweetie 0 my gosh please stop doing that what in the world are you doing
stop writing you are going to take up your entire notebook we have many problems to do today j what in the world sweetie the worst part is it s right it s okay don t forget to put the date at the top of your paper
do you 13 okay so fractions f 4 twelfths +3 twelfths so then skip a line and then do what are you doing
when i was i wrote the answers and then i wrote down of the problem okay i can t wait to see how you re going to do this you cannot add them like that when i did it sorry give me 12nd i did it this way right 0 you have you cannot add them this way because if they have different denominators then it messes you up confused you have to change it to vertical i m sorry
horizontally but i did 5 of them right so you do it just like me great sweet good excellent easy peasy love it shh why isn t this all the way up here
now good good excellent . really neatly come do f when s done come do g go all the way over girl
over and then and then aw i have many pages friends no worries will the whole class get to do 10 yes yay more than one time probably more than once more than 2 times more than once i love it
right thumbs up or thumbs down thumbs up yes 2 thumbs up come on now g one night what shh fine all right next person come stand k
r perfect i had come care h excellent i love my class a lot
do it in a 2nd all right pick a different color perfect
i i m letting you write on my smartboard because when i make mistakes you guys laugh at me j do it in the bottom corner just push it across
while she s doing that what is no simplifying mean mean you re it s just it mean it is a quick equation but why don t we need to simplify 4 sixths because they . they all have the same denominator the denominators are the same number it s the same number but that s not why
be nothing else can make this smaller numerators 2 use the same denominers denominators and then simplify the fraction
why all right so one tenths +4 tenths do they have the same denominators yes yes so i keep them the same and my numerator is what 55 why did you simplify it no because on this one they had the same denominator but i didn t simplify
hand because why do i have to do it to 5 tenths because you can make it smaller how can i make it smaller by doing what finding it s common factor 0 doing finding it s common factor what you mean i taught you something one and 5 can anything else make 5 no and 10250 look 0
5 divided by 5 is interesting interesting how that nicely works out see 2 fifths +15th equals 3 twelfths what
3 tenths what wait you adding huh no you re adding wrong you re adding wrong why is that wrong thank you for not yelling at me me try again because the bottom stays the same 0 the bottom stays the same because they have the same denominators
ready i m going to prove to you something can what s my multiples of 313 can anything else multiply together to get 3 no what about 515 can anything else multiply get 5 no no so so do they have anything the same besides one
133 it s the same number what s 5 divided by one smaller all right so let s do 3 eighths +2 eighths 0
keep the denominator the same eighths and put 5 on the top trick i don t know if they re both even you can simplify it no shh if they re both odd you can simplify it odd neither neither they re neither
is even you cannot do it shh but a fraction like 3 . like 3 and 6 . like 3 . like 3 sixths 3 and 61 a half that s a half okay ready
go this is why i do perfect look at all this yes so we have to do the whole thing that with the things all right so let me see it
no do the next one shh raising your yes simplify shh shh because you can t simplify why shh you done you haven t done a single one in the entire time i ve walked around
good when you are doing it can you i don t what are . what are these number like 8 . like 8 okay because this one . this on is d this one is e and this one is f right go because i didn t do those kind of numbers
what are you doing on aah
problem do d wait 0 my gosh that s okay it s he s on d
shh can they be simplified no go ahead and do e you don t need that
don t one ninth can it be simplified no can anything evenly be taken away by both
no that s nothing . nothing can be taken away by both e i told you you did not you can t bear on the smartboard like that eraser
huh he he and you all laugh at me when i do things 5 twelfths shh +22 twelfths sorry okay equals 7 twelfths can it be simplified no
job all right excellent teacher modeling adding fractions with like denominators here s the problem here s the problem 15 sixths +5 sixths 0
it . if the fraction if it s greater than your wait i need to do what e the denominator do they have the same denominator yes so all i do is bring it nicely over what 10 on the top add add the top
fraction chain fraction so help me do the chain fraction what s my unit 66 so how many 6 s do i need to write 10 okay ready 16213141567891010 yes how many how many sixths make a whole
123456 this makes one whole and i have how many left over 41 and 4 okay so one and 4 sixths psst you can do something else simplify i can simplify it color if i have 4 sixths how could i simplify it
0 you 0 do the . do the parenthesis and then multiplication okay so 41 and and 6322 and common 2 circle the 24 divided by 2 is
is 3 so one and 4 sixths also equals one and thirds 2 thirds is it more work here all right so i m going to do the next one
that s hard it s hard are we going to do all ready 58s because i m doing all the work right now yeah but we got to all right same denominator 8 on the bottom on the bottom and what goes on top
4121212 okay so now what c now what you the fraction down like 8 how many . how many 8s 1212 sweetie pay attention 23456788910
1112 now how many do i circle 8 good 12345678 check so that equals one whole right you talking to me
yep and how many do i have leftover 4444 eighths 4 eighths so i have one whole and 4 eighths and then you this one s easy if i double the 4 i get 8 so what do you know this is equivalent to one and one half one half one and one half got it
yeah bigger only do 2 go it i thought you would get the point because this one lines shh i love but not right now
job thank you only do e and f yes that s cute i love all right e
yes thanks it bothers me
do add the numerator okay 1st of all i need to look at the denominator is the denominator the same yes so i just bring it over right but now what is my top
problem the top number is bigger than the . so what do i have to do under it it let me use your pencil you mean the before one
doing the 12 is your bottom but i need to do how many 12s 16 okay so 112th +112th and do 16 of them
yep keep going i like this yeah you can get them at dollar i can t do 16 yes you can
trick okay a trick a trick to make it easier because is this a lot of work yes when you re done with e stop and just look at me oops sorry
together what s 12 +1212 all right so what s 11 +5 good okay so now i have divide by all right ready
trick all right so i have 11 twelfths +5 twelfths what s my fraction everyone 16 twelfths i love how you re everyone again what s my fraction everyone 16 twelfths one more time 16 twelfths okay ready
easier ready watch yep ready it s improper yes factors i want to make it really easy and i ll show you why how this is so much easier 161 and one and 16
and 02 and 882 and what else one more 43 and 44 and 44 and 4 okay so help me we do . we do 12 a lot one and 121 and 121 and 12 and 63 and 43 and 43 and 4 what do they have in common 44 okay ready watch watch watch watch 116 divided by 4 is 44412 divided by 4 is
34330 it s still improper but isn t it much smaller write 4412340 isn t that much easier than drawing 16 of them
no it s equivalent they re . they re what equivalent they re equivalent they re equivalent this is easier you skip a whole step of drawing 16 twelfths if 16 twelfths works for you go for it
thing when you start getting numbers line 48 over 20 you re . you re not really going to want to do this are you question i i got one . can i come look
f i m coming because you only have 12 of your one twelfths how many do you need to have shh 16 you have 16
12345678910111213013141516 so you circled 12345678 equals 9101112 so you circled 12 yes so you were left with one and 12344 twelfths right
do i didn t see the clock what s wrong with 4 twelfths can t you simplify it 441 and 4 what else 2 times 2 times 2 yep 121 and 12 what else 2 and
common 4 and 4 right 4 divided by 4 is divided by is . is one is 3 so look it shh i want to see i want to see
i want to see yeah 0 hold on 2 you didn t one okay so you did it all right you did it right 2 what s 4 divided by 41
one you got it right you got it right l you did because how many do you need to circle how many makes a whole 1212345 were you looking 123456789101112 this is one whole because how many 12s make a whole
whole 112th 1212 how many 12s make a whole 12 okay so this is how many wholes one look you got the right answer one and 4 twelfths perfect i m going to do it right now shh shh shh shh
shh shh shh all right 3 eighths +7 eighths 4 people aren t looking at me shh and i just really liked my outfit today and i thought you wanted to look at me okay all right so now do i look at the same denominator
over what about my numerator yes 10 okay so now i have 10 eighths easier than drawing 10 eighths i want to do my factors yes that s easy okay my factors of 10 are 125 all right what about 81 and 8248 anything else no
22 and 210 divided by 2 is 58 divided by 2 is 0 chain fraction chain fraction means it s how many wait do now that i have the smaller improper fraction what do i do 5 fourths 5 fourths okay ready one what 2345 am i right
and how many how many fourths make a whole it think about think about quarters how many quarters make a dollar yes how many quarts make a whole 4 right all right so i circle 4 of them so my answer is one
yes all right we still got 0 and i have how much time left minutes 15 time to teacher modeling shh what add fractions okay ready
me 2 twelfths +4 sixths here s the difference all the ones that you ve done before had the same denominator have the same denominator do you know how to do this 0 that was so easy okay so yes since it s so easy can you tell me why i don t like this problem
wait before i start can you take a brain break and i need you to just stand and do a quick one minute stretch i m going to put a minute on the clock jumping jacks 10 jumping jacks go
12345678910 down slowly to the right guys 3 you should be about the back and getting to the front again
left start at the front and then roll slowly to the left again all right arms up them
do 10 backwards all right go ahead and do a little quick stretch and shake it out
i need your attention in 10 sitting down 6543 missing 2 eyes
me you can t add them together because they don t have the same denominator they don t have the same denominator so i can t add them together morning say for instance i put some strawberries in my smoothie do you think that would really taste good with some peanut butter no no they re . they re opposites remember how we did electricity
opposites opposites usually repel so i cannot add strawberries and peanut butter peanut butter because that s just gross fraction so who has his hand up nicely how do i do it
you . you . you re right what the . least common l c m or on the video they told you it was the least common d
denominator denominator okay ready so my denominators the 1st thing i do is do what do you re going to count simplify i m not simplifying i m finding my multiples so i m going to count by
6 all right so count by 66 i found it here yes okay so can you tell me what i do next . you have to count down to see how much see like this
isn t it i feel like you are my teacher so how do i get my 4 sixths to get a 12 at the bottom 0 okay e he did a one and 2 because one times 6 is 6
is 12 okay so one times 12 that s so tiny is 12 does that make sense that okay so now what so i have 4 sixths and i need to end up with the same denominator how did you get 2 that s a 2 shh how shh how shh shh how hey did i say you were wrong no
me because . if you count down . like 6 times 2 is 12 yes so that s why you got 2 and what i do to the . denominator bottom the bottom excellent shh not okay so now he found an equivalent fraction to 4 sixths so now can i have my pen
now i m left with 2 twelfths plus what 8 twelfths 8 twelfths 8 twelfths look at you mister get 10 twelfths 10 twelfths hey look how this makes easy fraction
10 twelfths you can make it simplified why can i make it simplified because they re both even okay so ready work work do we have do we have to simplify it
yes because on your test sometimes this won t be an answer and you re going to get this answer and go but the answer is 10 twelfths but it s going to have a different answer so if i have 10 twelfths i need to simplify okay 10 . 10 times one is 10
22 times 551 times 12122 times 844 times 66 what matches everywhere 222 all right so 10 divided by 2 is is 66 i did it again 12 divided by 2 is yes can this be simplified anymore no
it this is your answer so on a test it probably won t have this nice beautiful answer it s going to have this answer and your little brain is going to go but i know it s 10 twelfths but i know it s 10 twelfths if you get an answer and you know that you did it right simplify it and i guarantee you the answer s going to be there
questions no yes you know 2 twelfths and 4 sixths that s a lot of i tried to tell you that half of 12 is 6 and half of 4 is 2 that s a lot of work okay so let s do this one i m going to do it with you aw
k can i add an 8 and a 4 yes shh why can i not add an 8 and a 4 same denominator what do i need to find the same denominator the same denominator okay so how do i find the same denominator count by
4s okay so this side i m going to count by 4s 48812 then you stop there why do i stop there l the denominator is 8 the denominators are the same now yes thank you
do go to sleep simplify no it all right so come on sit yep everybody will be teaching so i have 14th how do i do it 0 you have 12 perfect
that because he counted because he counted i want to be the teacher next is he done no what 4 eighths plus he needs to add them perfect +2 eighths can he add eighths and eighths now
it wait i want to be the teacher how do i do it how does he do it find his his factors factors huh excellent so now he s got to find his factors of 81 and 8 help him one and 81 and 82 and 42 and 44 and 2
24 and 8 so what does he have in common so he circles the 2 and then does 2 and he divides it 2 and he left with 444 thirds 3 fourths 3 fourths okay ready
mind mine s mind blowing let me see here thanks for getting me a pencil room here don t we here go back
seat thank you shh okay so now what do i do love that awesome awesome yes
going now what perfect yes okay so wait can you re right can . can i . can i . you re right okay so i have this fraction right here right yes
so now we need to add the fraction that makes 2 fifths so you did this how did you get from 2 fifths to have a denominator of 10 is 10 so 2 times 2 is
shh yeah 12 yeah 12 what what can you add them now l i already got one problem huh teacher b i found it because all right so show me the problem
it now count count thank you the factors what s a factor of 6 keep going one and 6
what else 123 yes 2 and 3 good what makes 102 good common they have . . circle it
close what did . what did you say equaled 6 times 3 and okay so if you re doing 6 divided by 2 your answer is 3 yep 3 is 10 that s divided by 2 shh no you don t is 5 yes
okay so you got 2 fifths right yeah how did you get to 10 on the bottom what how did you get to 10 on the bottom because this is your denominator right
12 times it by 2 no
okay cheating teacher b you can t simplify it b they re cheating i don t care if they looked all right do the next one just like you did the 1st one it okay perfect okay so now get there okay it s hard can you help me
okay wait what you do is to do this you go to can you add them up this you need to do the box and then you need to count down by what by i m done but that s not my problem baby girl
from which problem did you do one which one were you doing isn t . isn t 8 divided by 48 divided by 4 is there you go
12 tenths +2 fifths all right tell me 0 you got to the teacher shh r i have like 2 minutes a box
no why because you have to have to the same it s not the same denominator so i need to write the multiplies all right so let me start with 5510
is 4 so now i m adding 4 tenths can i add them together now same the the denominator is the same so i keep the denominator the same and add what 2 to the top it because you can i can make it smaller
16 and one and . i don t know 2 and 2 and and 2 and 33 what about 101 and 101 and 102 and 522 and 5 what do they have in common 226 divided by 2 is
how if you multiply these 2 numbers 0 we re not there yet
you have a question if you don t get it by then i ll work it through because i do want to get to the struggle time but i did want to address the homework problem
do what i do
do those are are we checking these when was the last time you had recess let s focus page thank you for trying
now both and were on the right path are you checking this one yes i don t want to have more people coming and getting you guys more and more confused lesson so i want to address their misconceptions
each we had 7 eighths of one color and 3 fourths of another okay you took half of what you already used so you can t do that can you
this stop close he knew what he was doing he was just getting locked in his work focus
8 one times 4 is 4 so it s 4 eighths wait hold on though that s not an 8th so does this one necessarily have to be an 8th no
4th so does this have to be an 8th it should be a 4th also so how did i get from 2 to 4
so one times 2 is 2 so i have 3 fourths -2 fourths to give me 3 -2
excellent then 2 times 4 so one times 4 is 4 3 okay
okay all right excellent what is 3 eighths and 14th all right
is going to come up to the board and do the last one you have to learn if you don t want to get on the camera sit at the back table
the question asked to you simon has 7 eighths of a bag of marbles he gives 14th of them to his friend
what guys it s pretty obvious you re not listening video don t just behave because the video is on learn how did she get the 2 someone asked how did she get the 2
8 so she had to times 4 times 2 which will get you to 8 sense you have to find the least common denominator the least common denominator is 8
method i m going to show you guys a different method today now what we re going to do is forgo the struggle time now because we ate up some time going over the homework go ahead and put that in your folder and put your folder away please
okay the homework not all the time sort of
2 thank you table one now what you see being handed out to you is a lesson on problem solving with fractions
now if you look at the lesson if you look at the lesson it says problem solving method make a model
yes we are going to make a model today to learn how to solve a word problem involving fractions so all this all week we ve been practicing with adding and subtracting our fractions away today it s coming to our performance
it so what we re going to do is i m going to give you a set of fraction strips and you re going to get a set of fraction strips per table because i don t have 25 fraction strips what we re going to do is step by step go through the method and then we re going to use the method to solve one 5
questions while i m passing out the fraction strips i want you guys to read over the part that says understand the problem
it i want you to quietly read that part while i hand out fraction strips
on somebody s missing a 12th if you re missing a go sit with if you re missing a 112th piece raise your hand it yes
away if you look at the work in front of you did i ask you to open the bags 5 4 3 2 one thank you s team for not opening the bags
thank you s team for not opening the bags s team and s team for not opening the bags
yet okay so it says brent sowed 2 pieces of cloth end to end to make a flag the 1st piece was yellow and a half long
i want every group to quietly open your bag and take out one half piece
take out one half all right
blue the 2nd piece was 13rd long and blue you find a 13rd piece in your mix
find a 13rd piece in your mix to all right
green so you should have a 13rd piece and a one half piece 13rd piece and a one half piece
point okay what s the question not yet what i want you to do now is find the whole piece
find the whole piece quietly yes what color is your whole
red i can wait cool so put the pieces on your paper
up one whole 14th 13rd
no we re only okay put tape under that novel idea
no we know we have to do something with this so let s look at our problem
so he has a one half yard piece and a 13rd yard piece
what does the question ask you to do it says how long was the flag once sowed so how long is that flag
okay how do we get the length of 2 separate pieces this so what happens to this piece i have to add it to the 3rd don t i the 3rd and the half i need to add them together
that i can wait
d and you guys don t touch i did a move did i added one half and 13rd because that s what told me to do
then i asked is that possible just like that that said no denominator what denominator do you think will help us 3 no
16th a 16th piece do you see why i didn t do this one right away because you re knowledge of common denominators is going to help you with this lesson right
so take a 6 and add a 6 underneath the line did okay right someone had a very good statement
become what would the 6th become a new denominator what do we call that new denominator excellent so i am going to now have to add as many 16th pieces as i need to to fill that entire amount correct
yes i want you to go ahead and work on that and raise your hand when you have an answer for me
i m going to try to tape my thing back up
so you discovered that 13rd +16th equals a half or 13rd plus a 6th plus a half equals a whole you discovered something neat right
it 3 no one it s a half 13rd is a half it s not a half listen to me 13rd how many sixths equals 13rd
2 so 2 sixths plus another 6th equals what 3 sixths which equals a half so that s a half plus a half have all right hand you need 6 of them to equal up to the 3rd
5 now you know what if you guys don t like when people answer then stop shouting it out yes what
you re missing some sixths you don t need sevenths put them all in your bag and use this don t mix the bags up problem i m asking for a hand
what s the answer i m asking a question what s the answer to his problem 5 sixths and noticed something very interesting will you come up to the board
here s the extra piece you might want to show them worksheet it s just one of those aha moments that these girls had me eyes on the board ears on the ladies no fingers on the material
if you add 16th to one half it equals a 3rd and a whole and 2 sixths is 13rd so put your 6th piece where you want it did thank you ladies enlightening they came over and said look at that ms
f so 6 sixths is also equal to 16th +13rd +one half why why do you think they do that because it will make another whole can you explain how or why that makes a whole
it up top it says one and then if you look on the bottom of it those 3 pieces makes the same shape that means it s one whole it just depends on how you line them up off to sum up what he said this is the common denominator isn t it
we knew off the bat that a 6 is a common denominator between a half and a 3rd to 2 sixths right so if i did this 2 sixths what did we add here here plus a 6th gives me what
what do i know about 3 sixths it s equivalent to one half what do we know about one half +one half it s a whole it s a whole 13rd +16th definitely does equal a half
okay i know different does everybody understand how to use these pieces to solve this problem yes the bottom of that sheet tells you how to justify the method checking your work the lcd method
waiting go ahead and turn to question one on the back volunteer read question one for me while i reset my board
i m sorry students stop playing with the pieces
down if i hear a piece you will move your name and work with no pieces for the remainder of the lesson
okay so what fractional part are you working with here what fractional part are you working with here 14th and 2 thirds so what should we always anchor to
d the least common denominator before the least common denominator we should always anchor to what whole everybody pull out your whole then we said we re going to look at 14th
4th you ll notice that your common denominator will fill in the remainder
ready take 14th and put it right below the whole
thirds so take 2 thirds pieces or 21 thirds pieces i m sorry it by adding them you should put them next to it
i m going to tell you a little trick that and just found out how you can identify the least common denominator if you have these pieces you ll notice can we add that no hold on
you ll notice that i can wait you ll notice that you have a little bit of leftovers before you make your whole
that leftover is going to help you identify what your least common denominator is so see if you can identify what fractional amount is missing
pieces raise your hand and tell me how much left you have how much space left and what would fill it in 12th take the piece to the board and see if we can prove him right so if i put that on the board does that fill in the whole
yes so we know 14th +2 thirds +112th equals a whole right so now i know my common denominator is what 112th come on up help me out with my twelfths how many twelfths am i going to have
i ll put the tape on them for you to solve the 14th and 2 thirds no all the way to 13rd
so you do the same while is doing it and see if we can come up with the same answer quietly
top hold on everybody should be manipulating their twelfths put it on the board i modeled 2 of them so you should understand how to fill in the rest after you do the work
i m borrowing 12 pieces all right hand maybe on the next one
how many twelfths raise your hand if you can how many of you found an answer hand what was your answer you worked with on the board 11 twelfths what s the answer to number one
11 twelfths of a mile any questions i want you i have a question yes
inside work with your partner and do 2 3 4 and 5
together i should see talking and working
work with the girls behind you i ll be right there i just need to pull the tape off these pieces
okay so if it says he grew a half of an inch then 2 fifths of an inch what are we doing to these 2 numbers row based on your explanation you know your common denominator is what
in how many tenths does this equal that will be your answer good work girls name excellent job of all days to leave my camera this would be a day to take pictures it keep going
i want you to work on the whole worksheet okay wait him just showing tenths isn t going to help him
i m asking how you re going to show so he knows i m not quite sure if i agree with your method but he is right
tenths good work i added it together no you didn t you added this and that remember when i said you have to find the common denominator 10 9 of those pieces no you don t have to draw them
can sit down your group is about 2 steps away from coming in during resource tomorrow and doing this activity
no let s go see what your table did
it 15th and 2 fifths what do you think would be your common denominator 10
whole take it and put 10 all the way across fill that up me mouths closed now i have it is very loud in here
concentrate i asked you to use inside voices this you need to bring it down when you re ready raise your hand if your group wants me to check your work will if it s finished you will be done and we will move on i m giving you 5 more minutes of work time
i don t have much candy today but i ll get you some
no so you guys liked the old fashioned okay no worries i was just asking because i was showing you a different method i ll show you another one next week
7 excellent work pick up your pieces and put them in the bucket up front incorrect good work girls
go ahead and put $3 on your table let s look
need you need help this is my thing right why are you 2 lost and he s finished what are they bring it down 5 4 3 5 4
the only people that can have a snack right now is these 3 ladies because everybody else i haven t verified their work yes so you re adding this plus this don t tell them show him
he s going to show you how to get there okay okay minutes what did i say if you re ready for verification up when is done i m going to check your work yes
get a 14th piece out
move your name twice no don t just give him the answer that s not going to help him learn what do you think you re going to use
what pieces are you using 18th and one half what do you think is going to be the common denominator is there a relationship between 8 and 2 it what s your common denominator 5 4 3 2 one
i need you to unless you are s table pack up all pieces do not say one word me starting now one word your banana garbage
patient i have a lot of bananas going in the garbage can
there help him get there yes
you had a 18th and one half what s the relationship is there a relationship between these 2
2 times 4 is 8 so that means that 8 can be your common denominator right there s a relationship there so you can use the largest number
denominator least common look at these numbers here all right i need all pieces picked up
it not really what s your least common denominator 4 2 does this method make more sense to you
know if you can do this method do this method it s just going to take practice you have a seat half all right i m ready
ready what is that
i want everyone to sit down i want every now to wrap back up what method did you find easier
do you find using the strips easier or do you find using the numbers to compete easier using the numbers why okay which one
up i like both of them
i the regular number method okay r i like the strips
p i like let s do an easy vote if you like the strip method better raise your hand hand finding the least common denominator
here so does it matter how you get to the answer no so go ahead and pack your stuff up quietly so we can get to our additional lesson today
if you are as you re packing up missing a piece let me know
information when i took lunch count today what information data did i collect what you want for lunch what you want for lunch account so we use information in our everyday lives all the time
can anyone give us an example of data we might collect if we were doing a what s that word survey if i m going to collect data and take a survey what does that mean you collect information about what people like you collect information like what else can i collect information or data about
what people are wearing what people are wearing d attendance attendance how many people are here r their favorite color their favorite color their favorite food their favorite food
m take a look at this word and sound it out and tell me if you know what this word is it s a very fancy word but it has a very simple meaning statistics statistics what are statistics
it has to do with math yes statistics has to do with math d information information data data information what s the word i m looking for
collect statistics boys and girls is just the study of data so once we collect the data we have to do what with it
it so you are going to be ready for this word statisticians today j the person who studies data the person excellent who studies that data or statistics okay today boys and girls we re going to be taking some data on boxes of raisins
we use boxes of raisins to collect from data because besides counting the raisins what else are we going to get to do with the raisins eat them we re going to get to eat them heard i heard this word and i think you might have saw it on your puzzle yes lots of times to collect data you do some estimating 1st before you collect your actual data
so what i m going to ask you to do 1st when i pass out the . could you give everyone a paper towel okay not right now but we will seats i already cut them all up you don t have to do that missus d to be so prepared and know where everything is
down i m going to let everyone sit down do not open your box of raisins because before we actually count the raisins we re going to do what estimate we re going to estimate how many raisins are in the box and then we re going to collect data data we re going to collect the data about your estimates and record it
is it possible for one raisin box to have more than the other did you hear is really thinking like a statistician his question was is it possible for the raisins to have different amounts in them yes
missus d she ran out and got us all the raisins she ran out and got us all the raisins thanks now remember you re not opening
i see people doing excellent what are you doing checking he s checking right looking at different ways that you can make your estimate too look at the box and see if it tells you any information of how they made measurements
hear and then i estimated and i got it right take your hand away from your mouth honey i can t hear you again when someone s talking and you talk to the person next to you we can t hear that person talking
himself so please if someone s talking make sure you re giving that person your complete attention could you put that stuff away please so you made an estimate on something and i put golf balls they were the same size and i got the closest answer to it
okay and i m going to ask you for an estimate of how many raisins you think are in the box record i m going to ask you to record the data i m going to ask you to record the data that i record on the board on the back of your vocabulary word search so you re going to need a pencil for this
you re going to need a pencil because i m going to ask you to record our estimates raisins wow how lucky is that all right i m going to erase some of the board so we can put our estimates down okay what is your estimate of how many raisins you think might be in the box
10 you think there might be 10 raisins in the box 17 you should be copying the data down on your paper on your paper my pencil broke i m going to go around the room so you don t have to raise your hand
40 20 watch this and raise your hands if you can tell me what i m doing knows
a survey no i just made a little mark
r excellent more than one person gave me the same estimate so we use what s called tally marks to record that data so you don t have to repeat the number
raisin use everything you already know to come up with your estimate because remember an estimate is a . guess no it s not just a regular old guess it s a what educated guess you use information you already know to make a prediction or an estimate 15
35 make sure you re going vertically with your data paper who did i leave off with
15 13 we re going to put our data in order when we re done hear when someone talks and you talk too i can t hear them 27 27 you said 13
20 50 l
seats come back to your front seats no please don t go in front of the machine so no one steps on it so please walk around it yes i m going to move these up so you can see them okay here
20 20 is a pretty popular number 56s student 10 different range of estimates
16 do i have a 16 yet no that hands please if you can tell me why i did that yes it s easy to calculate or count by . 5s 5s
we re not opening the box yet close the box please yet once we get to the count of 5 on tally marks we cross it over so it s easy to count when we go to add up the data we ve collected 25 25 do i have 25 here
20 35 35 and
46 30 okay who can tell me to make sure everyone s data let me finish my question please who can tell me what i can do to make sure i ve collected everyone s data in the room
d you can count all the numbers before i count these numbers what do i need to count correct and if i have not the same number of students as i do estimates we re wrong we have to recalculate
28 could you recount and and see if i m correct please could you count the pieces of data on your paper please and don t forget to count your tally marks
3 could you count the pieces of data on your paper 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 . what did you get
28 okay so there are 28 people correct
26 27 you did not count down that one over there which one this one no hold on could one person raise their hand and tell me what i probably missed
j you missed the last one on the 20 20 so do we have the same pieces of data that we have for the number of pieces in the room 28 who
hands please hands please j did you give us your estimate do you see how as a statistician you have to go back and make sure you ve collected the right number of data
it what is your estimate for how many raisins you think are in the box ready while you are counting your number of reasons you have to go back to your desks guys you have to go back to your desk take your raisins with you
i ll get you raisins while you are quietly counting your raisins missus d is going to get ready to record the actual number have a seat thanks the actual number of raisins that are in each of your boxes so over here are our our what estimates estimates
what put the actual what the actual count of exactly how many raisins there are does everyone have a box of raisins raisins why don t you take everything off your desk so you have space to count
once you ve counted all the raisins you can eat them but make sure you record your count okay before you eat them right now buddy you re going to count the number of raisins that are in your box
okay try to count in your head because everybody s counting you re going to count your actual see how close you were to your estimate but your number right at the top of the paper where we re going to do . here s a suggestion missus
right over here is going to be your estimate and on the other side is going to be the actual number what on this side boys and girls these are our . estimates estimates
yes you should put your number right here
side you always want to collet your data boys and girls hands down please hands down for a sec you want to collect your data in organized neat columns and rows okay because we re going to be using this data that we collect to record it
so on the right hand side of your paper at the top you should write the actual number of raisins and then put your count at the top 1st question you have my paper i have your paper
paper i like the way some of you grouped your raisins so it s easier to count paper so make sure did you write the actual numbers of raisins at the top of your paper
right up here at the top could you write the actual number of raisins at the top of your paper and then put your count please see if you were close or not close to your estimate okay i m going to go around the room just like i did before with your estimates and get your actual numbers okay
so please be sure before you start eating the raisins you write down the actual number of raisins on your paper so you don t forget 30 what did you have counting i m going to do something to make it easier to collect my data when i go to record it because we re going to have to map out or record our data next
12nd i m going to collect our data and put it in order from smallest to largest number it s time for you need to go tell him just push in your chair can i eat a raisin
yes who did i start with 46 35 what do you notice about the way i m collecting my data what do you notice about the pattern of how i m collecting my data so far
doing i m putting it in order from smallest to . biggest largest boys and girls what s it going to be called when i collect the data and i have the smallest number all the way to the largest number r the range the range very good
range that s going to be our range of actual numbers of raisins have what was your actual count 34 you know what guys next
34 what are you already noticing about these boxes of raisins that are supposed to be the same right you guy these raisins in the store and all the little boxes look exactly the same don t they
notice they re different they have different numbers of raisins in them 36 calculated do i have your number up here okay who did i leave off with i m getting a little confused who i left off with 16 in the box honey how many
again i have to tell you again if i m talking to somebody and you yell out i can t hear that person and i get off track and then i don t have everyone s tallies 33 down you should be copying down the actual number or raisins in each person s box
i m going to wait a 2nd hands down please and i m going to let everyone get caught up you re going to need this information because you re going to be recording this data i m going to wait a 2nd and let everyone finish counting and then i ll answer a question if you can hold off for just 12nd
honey i just had you go back to your seat to count your raisins at your desk 330 thank you what should i put here before i do any tally marks on this one i m going to put all the numbers down to make sure i have everybody and then we ll use tallies okay
d i remember s answer was 46 you do we have your count up here you gave us 2 answers honey you gave us 46 and then you recounted and gave us another count says did you give us 2 counts buddy yes or no
46 was my estimate that s over there buddy we already did this right number remember these are . estimates estimates on this side
raisins what is it m how about we do that
12nd please i m not there yet i m just going to let everyone get caught up sorry as soon as we re done counting okay 33 33 wow what are you noticing already about the data we re collecting of the actual number
most of all of them so far 33 happens to be . the winner i do not know if it s the winner but more than not these boxes have 33 how many were in your box 33
35 you have to continue recording your data with us honey missus d puts a piece of data on the board you guys have to put a piece of data
35 40
23 32 i m going to move up here boys and girls so you don t have to look at the bottom of the board
40 do i have a 40 31 did you say 31 31 there s a 32 right there you are very good statisticians at this point
37 35 do i have a 35 yep right there thank you
l i already told you 32 where is 32 do i have everyone s actual number of raisins
it student 330 yes any of them count 36 i have 36 too okay let me tell you again honey
okay because now we have to talk about how could i record this data so it s easier to see read what do statisticians do once they collect data
data we know how many raisins there are in each box right now that s very difficult to read isn t it j you could put like for 33 you could put a line next to it after the number . so we could use the . tally tally marks yes we could use the tally marks
what s another way i could make it easier to see this data you could put 30 then 31 then 32 yes we re going to have to put this in order that s going to be the next thing we do could you continue to copy down your data or you re not going to be able to do buddy the next step so all these numbers have to be recorded on your paper okay so you can do the next step
anyone have any idea how i could take this data i now have and make something that makes it easy to read my data nobody no ideas
helps it we could make a graph about what each box how many raisins are in each box i have another question for you which box of raisins would you rather have
please which box of raisins would you rather have 45 i think i d want this box of raisins what if you did not like raisins 23 yes you might go with the box of 23
c right now we need to take our actual number of raisins and record them in order before we begin our graphing
it okay could you put your 1st and last name on the yellow lined paper please thanks babe i don t know whose they are but if i squoosh the raisins . 0 there s one over there too can you pass that back for me please
honey now we re not going to throw our trash out now you can just leave it at your desk for right now we ll collect it all together we re going to put our actual number of raisins data in order okay
so if i m going to put this in order or make a range what number am i going to start with what number am i going to start with number the least the lowest we re going to start with the lowest number and work our way up set i need pencils ready statisticians i need pencils ready
hands could you do that afterwards buddy could you do that afterwards please have 108 honey how many 23s do we have one i m going to cross it out so i don t repeat myself
pencils statisticians we are recording our actual numbers now so the 1st number on your paper should be 23 what would be next what number would be next 30 now you can make your tally mark
2 i need the statisticians recording right now 31 i m going to cross that out so i don t repeat myself 32 how many 32s do i have
3 guys i think it s easier instead of including the number i m going to put 2 tally marks that means we have 2 31s okay instead of counting this in the tally mark i think that s difficult i m going to make the tally marks 2 okay so for us collecting this data this means there s one 23 how many 30s are there 3
there 3 i think it s easier to count the tally marks than it is to count the number in the tally mark okay because we want to make our job as easy as possible
8 let s cross those out
34 how many 34s do i have 3 if you can t see my friends in the back come right up to the front please
okay question we ll worry about that afterward honey okay 36 come on up to the front honey front you re a little bit too far away to collect these tallies at the bottom this data
36s 22 what s next 371 what s next 40s 12 and what would be next
45 we have a statistician who has a change in their number 23 i had more in the box she had more in the box that she did not count so i m glad you went back and checked again 34 so we re going to remove the 23 cross it out and we re going to add one more tally mark to . 34
34 that makes a little bit more sense huh 23 wasn t very close to the numbers that we see are they re still not exactly the same but luckily the numbers are close to the same question can i throw my raisins out
2nd if you could wait till after the lesson when we re all done we ll all throw things out but right now if everyone gets up and throws things out we won t be able to continue now what do we have to do now that we ve collected our data and organized it j put it on the graph we have to record it on our graph
okay come on up to the front honey because we re going to be recording our data using all set i m going to pass out your actual graph and then we re going to talk about the parts of our graph if you could put your name on this on the back please that would be great
pass those over pass those back you re going to have to sit on your bottom honey and face that way on do you need something raise your hand honey
j i need a graph i m coming right around honey xcuse me miss d can i go to the bathroom not right now no l all set all set please put your name on the back of the graph and then face forward and look up here okay
okay can you guys let me know if elmo s awake when i push the button please is elmo awake no please you can see the light too
light thanks for checking it out though just put everything to the side please have your graph sitting this way and we need to talk about as fast as you can my friend one can you pass that over to please okay now we have to talk about what we actually see on this paper
what do we call these things and it goes back to how many people did graphing in 3rd grade excellent so you ve already started your statistics
you statisticians or people who collect data for a living use these graphs to record their data and make it easier to map out
honey what do you think the top of that line is for is so you know where the top of the paper is good guess student what i did not hear you honey forgetting you want me to come back to you
for could you pick that raisin up that s on the floor thank you be if you looked in our menu today of what we re doing it s right here no actually the title is right here in our menu of what we re doing today how many raisins are in each box how many raisins are in each box
now please write that please at the top of your graph
top if you can t see that let you know you re probably going to come sit up here honey come on up okay boys and girls does anyone know what these lines on a graph are called
the word starts with . please feel free to raise your hand if you want to share the great information you have term isn t it like a time stripe this word
a graph it s a graph yeah but do you know what these 2 particular lines the horizontal line that goes up and down and the vertical line of a graph the y axis and the x axis they are called this is the x axis of a graph and this is the . y
y axis the x goes 1st and the y goes 2nd yes very good buddy now before we can fill out how many raisins are in the box we have to come up with our range who remembers what the definition of range is if you re working with graphing
m how many we have now that would be our data is how many we have in each box data numbers it has to do with numbers but 2 particular numbers the smallest number the smallest number of your data and the highest number of your data excellent what is the smallest number of raisins that was in each box
30 what was the largest number of raisins that were in each box 41 hold on our statistician is rechecking
today good today instead of doing our normal math workshop we are going to work on an exemplar and we have done this before
the difference with this exemplar is this is a real live situation that is actually happening and it is really similar to something i have had to figure out before problem we have lots of steps to do before we get our answers and we will figure out a couple different answers challenge i should see everyone is hands up
job we are going to take it step by step and work through the problem okay exemplar this exemplar is having to do with what we have been talking about weights weights we have been talking about weights and this exemplar we are going to be talking about the customary measurements and units of weight who can tell me one of the customary units
one ounces oz to abbreviate what is the medium one we use pounds and what is the biggest unit ahead ounces pounds and tons if we were measuring something small we are going to use ounces if we are measuring something medium to big we are going to use pounds
if we are measuring something huge we use tons and we know this measurements sometimes if you have ounces you can convert that to pounds right 16 ounces is going to equal one how many pounds can we convert to tons
2000 so we have £2000 ton we have been working with this for a while now and you know how to convert this problem that we have today it is a challenge we are going to be converting ounces to pounds today we are planning a camp lunch
what i want you to do i am going to pass out the problem and i am going to pass out your graphic organizer matter everyone does have a blue exemplar
it is called planning a camp lunch what i am going to do please put your name on the exemplar and graphic organizer and i want you to take a minute and i just want you to read the camp lunch just read it to yourself quietly okay
me put your name on it and read planning a camp lunch to yourself
put your name and go ahead and read it silently to yourself
i love you how guys are working quietly and following directions thank you very much
problem just by reading it one time what do you all think about the problem there is 3 questions in all i love what said there is 3 questions so we are going to have to find 3 solutions questions if we just put one answer have we finished our problem
problem it talks about ounces and pounds yes so just by reading this i know when i read this the 1st time i thought this looks a little overwhelming there is a lot of information and it is asking for 3 answers
when we start a problem like this what is the 1st thing that we have to do decide what you need to find out problem what is our 1st step to understanding the problem
said writing it down we are going to go through and pick out the facts problem as you know sometimes when you are given a word problem do they just give you information that you do not need sometimes
so the 1st step is we need to understand this problem and by doing this we need to pick out what are the facts and then we need to find out what we need to find out what is it asking us so let us read this together so that we are on the same page
you you are in charge of wednesday is lunch at camp wilderness you need to order food for a total of 70 campers and counselors the lunch menu is hamburgers and french fries fruit and juice or tea
you expect some campers to eat more than one burger so you need to cook 30 extra burgers ounces how many pounds of meat do you need to order question i am going to underline it go ahead on your paper if you would like go ahead and underline on your paper
organizer so the question i am going to underline in red answer you have £25 of french fries
question we need to figure out how much french fries we can give out to each camper pantry is this enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces of fruit will there be any leftover or will you need to order more
right so this one says is there enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces and we need to answer will there be any leftover or will you need to order more problem raise your hand if you understand the questions
we need to figure out how many pounds of meat for everyone to have a hamburger we need to figure out how many french fries is each camper going to be able to have we need to figure out is there enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces
out so on your graphic organizer your 1st thought says what do i need to find out we just underlined it okay
okay so 1st we have 4 questions one question having to do with burgers french fries and fruit step raise your hand if you agree to start with the burgers hamburgers what do we know about burgers
facts raise your hand facts how many burgers do we need to cook for everybody to have at least one
70 so we need to cook 70 burgers but it says we need to cook how many extra that 70 +30 is 100
added if we are cooking 70 burgers we need to cook 30 extra cooking we figured out one step to our burger problem e each hamburger must weigh 4 ounces excellent
each patty must weigh 4 ounces patty anything else that we need to know okay now it says right here how many pounds of meat do you need to order
ounces no as we call the meat people and say hi we need to order blank amount of meat from you are we ordering it in pounds or are we ordering it in ounces pounds we have got to order it in pounds but we are serving it in ounces
do divide how do you all know divide it is small to medium so we are going to need to convert ounces to pounds step is everyone on the same page
burgers let us look at our wall of strategies over here yes remember drew pictures to help him answer his question did math she could see it in her head with multiplication and division you used a model right used manipulatives okay do you remember how you all came up to the same answer
yes we have our wall of strategies over here them what do you think might be some good ways to help us solve this problem b divide you are thinking divide use your basic operations anybody think they want to use manipulatives yes
okay so what i want you all to do right now we have all the facts and we know what we need to find out meat what i want you to do i want you to take the 1st step in finding out how many burgers yourself we know we have 100 burgers that we need to make
each burger is going to be 4 ounces order what is the 1st i see some who has it in their head what they need to do yet 1st we need to figure out multiply what do you need to multiply 100 times 4
m because it is 100 burgers at 4 ounces yeah so you 1st are going to figure out how many ounces work you can do this in your work box on your graphic organizer
400 we are going to need 400 ounces of meat now now divide why are you dividing because now you know how many pounds we know how many ounces but how are we ordering our burgers
pounds if we have 400 ounces we need to figure out how many pounds that is work we figured out how many ounces and now we need to figure out how many pounds when you have it write it on your paper and circle it so i can come by and see it when i call to place an order how many pounds am i going to tell them we need so we can make 100 burgers
ounces 100 times 4 is 400 ounces pounds see how it says 4 ounces equals how many pounds
out remember when we talked about converting sit up and show me your best math what do we need to do 16 excellent and why did you choose 16 as your divisor
excellent so go ahead 400 divided by 16 how are we doing good we have got one more minute and then we have got to talk about this as you finish the burger one as we wait i want you to go ahead and try the 1st one by yourself
if you are done go ahead and jump ahead and start picking out the facts for french fries
work when you have your answer go ahead and circle it so when i go by i can see it l so we took how are we converting ounces to pounds
excellent i want you to start started for solution you are going to write burgers equals okay when you have your solution on your graphic organizer put your answer find excellent
when you go right here for your solution for burgers equals blank pounds excellent go ahead right here put burgers equals blank pounds
if you have your solution go ahead and start on french fries how are we doing over here
remember when you come over here 16 times one is 16 over is that a 2 16 there you go
excellent go ahead and in your solution write burgers equals blank pounds 32 what is 4 times 16 62 let us try 16 times 5 and see what you get see if you can get closer to 80
i love the way when we talked about converting i heard i think say if if you are going from a small amount to big what operation do we need to do divide and if we are going from a big unit to a small unit we are going to multiply
in this case we have ounces going into pounds what operation are we going to use divide so i am going to take 400 and what am i dividing 400 by
16 because 16 ounces equals a pound excellent 400 divided by 16 what did you get 25 do we have any remainders no so when i call to place this order what am i going to tell them i need for burgers
pounds yes because the question says how many pounds of meat do you need to order solved we need to order £25 of meat easy let us go on to our next challenge french fries
i am going to go back to the start of my problem solving and i need to understand m £25 of french fries okay
fries we already know £25 of french fries what else do we know for french fries how much fries to give to each person that is what we are trying to figure out if we have £25 of french fries how many can we give to each person know go back to the top of my problem
what is important to know about these french fries they are served to 70 people yes we are going to serve french fries to 70 people so we have £25 and we have to give this to 70 people
if i have £25 and 70 people is that enough to give everybody one 25 so what do i need to do to the french fries instead of pounds what should i do to the french fries
multiply yeah i need to figure it out in ounces ounces is going to give us a much bigger number so we can divide that up to 70 people understand yes so instead of £25 £25 is how many ounces
drill £25
burgers put ff for french fries so £25 equals how many ounces is that
b thank you honestly this is kind of the exact opposite of the hamburger who noticed that
400 if you did not notice that pattern what could you do to solve this problem if you did not notice that we had just solved this what could you do to this 25 to figure out the ounces multiply by what 16
25 by 16 that is 400 right yes so now i can figure out how many equal amounts i am going to give 70 people do divide go ahead
work french fries get you want to find out each person will get blank ounces
if we have 400 ounces and i want to give that out equally to 70 people what should you do it i want to see you all do it
it is the same thing like on thursday when we have our winter break party you know i am going to have let us say 400 ounces of chips you what did you get 400 you only have 400 ounces
you have to pass that out to 70 people equally out boys and girls if you are a little confused if you want to do a turn and talk go ahead and talk to your neighbor
pictures a lot of you are just doing basic math i like that write this up for me like i did so i know you understand what this means
go ahead and write that up and see if you can start on the fruit
you guys are doing a great job all we need to know for french fries we have already ordered £25 of fries we want to figure out how many ounces am i going to give to everybody
when you come up to the cafeteria window how many ounces do i give each person so that everybody gets an equal amount so gets the same amount as and and nobody gets more than the other the key word equal amounts let us think about that when we think about our operations
now what are you deciding to do i am trying to figure out how many ounces you can get
operations divide okay what did you do 400 so you are saying you have 400 ounces of french fries and you want to divide that by 25
25 because there is £25 but remember the step before that you see up on the board 400 this is what the £25 has become 400 anymore instead of that 25 what are you going to divide by 16 no
this is how many ounces we have and we want to give this out to all the campers equally how many campers do we have 70 so that is what you want to use because this is how many we have total and we want to give every single camper an equal amount
job how many ounces does each person get 16 you said 400 ounces of french fries how many people are we going to give this out to
70 so what should you divide by confused boys and girls we took £25 and we converted that to 400 ounces amount it is just different units of weight
amount i want to give this out equally to everyone that comes to the lunch line line what do you want to do so we get an equal amount
divide when you take 400 and divide it by 70 that is going to tell you how many ounces everyone is going to get up i saw yours how many ounces is each student going to get
5 every student is going to get 5 ounces but when you solve this problem what did you have leftover leftover each person is going to get 5 ounces 5 not 5
if each student or each camper is getting 5 ounces and there is 50 left 10 yes 50 ounces of french fries and 10 lucky students gets an extra serving leftover 10 students get an extra serving
50 does everybody understand that question how much will each person be able to eat of french fries
each student will get 5 ounces and 10 lucky students get an extra serving okay now on to our last challenge we know we need to have some healthy food when we eat healthy let us go back to the top of the graphic organizer
to understand this the 1st step is to pick out the facts what do we know about fruit yes we have £20 of fruit
fruit how many people are getting this fruit 70 people the question says is this enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces
ounces then it says will there be any leftover or will you need to order more fruit we want to give every person 6 ounces and we need to feed 70 people problem what do we need to do with the pounds
ounces we need to convert them to ounces yes we have okay so £20 and you guys can do this by yourself £20 equals how many ounces
here let me see your work sorry we are on to fruit we finished burgers and we finished french fries fruit
right so £20 equals how many ounces 320 yes fruit easy yes this is how much we have
enough how many ounces do we want to give everybody 70 so how many ounces do we need do multiply divide why are you multiplying you can not say you don t know tell me your reasoning
multiplying we are not converting at all converted we found out we have 320 ounces i have 6 ounces i want to give 6 ounces to 70 people multiplying i am dividing why would you divide
because it is the small number to the big number but remember we are not converting right now e we already converted up here pounds to ounces converted now we need to know how much we need p we need to multiply we need to find out the number to equal 70
can you help piggy back off of do when i take 6 times 71st of all what is 6 times 70
420 420 is tell me what needed yes so we need 420 ounces
if i want to give every single person in here 6 ounces if we have 70 people that is 420 ounces well 320 ounces is that less than greater than or equal to it is less than 420
question is this enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces no leftover will you need to order more order we already have 320
420 how many more ounces do we need to order 100 i know these are tricky problems but i feel like you all did a good job
i want to make sure you understand why we multiply here instead of dividing remember we already converted so we don t need to convert anymore lunch i am going to look at my 4 red lines
question one how many pounds of meat do we need to order boys and girls 25 did everyone get that yes number 2 how much will each person be able to eat worth of french fries leftover 10 lucky students get another ounce
the final questions is this enough fruit for everyone to have 6 ounces not the question says that we had £20 which will be converted but it is 320 ounces if we want to give everyone 6 ounces there is 70 people
ounces if we have 320 and we need 420 no that is not enough do you need to order more ounces any questions time organize it
words i want you in your own words to explain what we did today how did we come up with £25 and how did we come up with 25 ounces and how did we come up with needing 100 more ounces in your own words use your math words part this is going to be your summary to wrap up what we talked about today
okay this has 2 questions in 11st answer no and the 2nd part is we need 100 more
today okay
writing putting your head down is not acceptable you did excellent solving here so i am proud of you yourself you should be able to write yours very easy because you understood it process how did you get those answers good job keep explaining those answers
we talked about being a point on the solid where 2 or more edges meet and when 2 faces meet together we say that this is an edge and we also identified that the 3 d solids are made up of 2 d faces
we noted that some of the faces were squares some of their faces were triangles so today we are going to continue by looking at the silhouettes anybody here knows anything about silhouettes yes it s like a shadow of the shape but you only see one side thank you it is exactly a shadow the shadow of the shape
before 0 good good so today we are going to learn something new and then you can go home and share with your parents silhouettes are the black shadows or shapes produced when an object lost light now when the sun s rays are out there and you are walking what do you see on the ground shadow have you ever asked yourself why you are seeing your shadow
it looks kind of crooked right but it s dark solid it is dark because your body is a solid mass you so the light is reflected and your shadow is thrown on the ground the length of your shadow will depend on the time of the day
hand do you see the outline of my hand but you cannot see my veins you cannot see anything you just see the shadow of my hand what is causing this is because the light from this cannot penetrate through my hand so it bounces on this mirror and is reflected away and that s why it casts that shadow
so that is what we call silhouettes any question about silhouettes and what it means shadows if you don t remember the word silhouette remember that a silhouette is a shadow produced when any solid object lost light the solid object cannot absorb the light so the light is reflected away from that surface and then you see the black shadow
so i m going to pull out the 1st geometric solid and then we ll have to identify the name like we did last time solid cube how many faces does a cube have
66 faces cube when i put this cube on the projector what do you think the image or the silhouette will look like the shadow that is going to pass on the screen what do you think will be the shape yes square she said a square anybody else have a different idea
yes a 2 d square a 2 d square okay let s try it yes do we see the whole figure no figure this is the side that is facing the light so that s the side that we see
now when i put it like this what happens edge it produces a little bit to show you that something that this thing does not just have you can see the corners right
rectangle a rectangle if i limit the to one of the faces it produces what okay now like the silhouettes let me try another one mister why does it turn into a rectangle when it sits on the edge
when it sits on the edge it s projected so you see part of this side and part of that side on the light the light is reflected on part of this side and part of that side so if a straight line it forms a rectangle
one so we said that this would produce square silhouettes i want everybody to say the word silhouettes say silhouettes silhouettes now you see that it has an h like in house okay spell but if you think about the letter that makes the sound you hear that s a french word
okay when you are singing the song alouette is sort of like silhouette the h is silent but you want to be able to spell it correctly it s sil hou ette sil hou ette then you ll be able to spell it correctly but it s pronounced silhouette now what do you think this cone what kind of silhouette do you think it s going to produce
yes a circle from which side you think it s going to produce the same silhouette when i put it on the circular face and when i put it on the face are they going to be the same silhouette no so what would produce a circle this one when i let it to rest on the circular face so let s try it
that would be a circle circular face to produce the circle
d if you stand it up straight then you get because you can t see the but if you stand it up straight you can t see the top of the this is the side that is blocking the light the circular base the base is the side that is blocking the light so that is the image we see
what kind of shape do you think is going to produce when i let it light up on its curved face a triangle who said a triangle yes a cone a cone cone how many it s going to be a triangle when it s projected
cone all right let s try this triangle now who knows why this is a triangle yes because it s shaped like a triangle on the side so the side that is blocking the light is shaped like a triangle you have to trace this line
you trace it like this it s going to be triangular right okay remember this is producing 2 dimensional silhouettes is it called 2 dimensional when we were doing our 2 d when we did our polygon what we call that is a polygon
f a polygon has to be 4 sides do you agree with that a polygon must be 4 sides no yes student v it can t be a . would this be considered a polygon
you i can t be a polygon because it has no straight sides it doesn t have straight sides else because it has a curve and a polygon has more than only one side this one has a curved edge polygons cannot be curved
the side or the line segment has to be straight now said that polygons are only 4 sides no is a triangle a polygon yes does it have 4 sides no teacher polygons can have more than 4 sides i was thinking about a quadrilateral all right you were thinking about a quadrilateral thank you
all right so when you rest a cone on its side it projects a triangle silhouette when you rest it on its base it projects a circular silhouette yes what will it look like when you put it on the thing that s a good one what do you think it will look like
yes an ice cream cone an ice cream cone cone we have talked about cones before and we talked about why it did not produce a cone
be do you think it s going to be as big as the base of this or smaller go the is circle this is a circle the same thing
point it s a circle you see that and we are seeing mostly this surface because that s the face that s very big so we see the reflection of that face do you see that okay so what we are going to do now
do you re going to work with your partner in your small group you your job will be to look at the solids in this bag pull out one solid at a time you and your partner will use ctivity book page 5
you re going to match the silhouettes and the solids so you look at each silhouette on page 5 and then identify the solids that you think would produce those silhouettes now the solids are all numbered can i finish talking
12 you can have any of those that are in your bag each bag contains 6 of the solids swap the bags are also numbered 3 a and 3 b will go together so when you re finished if your group is working with 3 a or 3 b when you are done you raise your hand and we re going to swap bags with those who are using 3 a
solids now when you identify these you match the solid and the silhouettes write down the number that you find on the solid block write it on the silhouettes on page 5 myself when you go back to your seats you re going to work with your partner that is sitting next to you on the same side of the desk you re going to have one of these bags
you will work with your partner to identify and to match the solids and their silhouettes the solids are all numbered when you identify a silhouette that this solid can produce
the letter number on this is one so when you find the silhouette that will be produced by this cube you re going to write this number one on that silhouette now i m going to say one thing some of these solids can produce more than one silhouette we just noticed that the cone can produce how many silhouettes how many
when you are done with the solids you and your partner are going to write down in your which one was the most difficult to identify the silhouette which one was most surprising for you all right and then we ll come back to check any questions
v if you and you put it on the edge will it look like a square i don t know that s what you re going to find out
out you re going to match the solids and their silhouettes anyone that has confusion if you and your partner are arguing about if it s true or not you come up to the overhead with your partner put the solid on the overhead and then see the silhouette that is projected then you will match it i do not want people rushing to the overhead you must try to identify it 1st
when you don t agree that is when the 2 of you will come i m going to control how it s done so that you will not do your work and everybody is rushing to the projector manner if there are some of the silhouettes that don t have a matching solid you write none on that silhouette any questions
can somebody tell us what you are going to do when you return to your seat yes tell the class what you will do
yes
are we ready to move yes
okay if you have table one go to your seat
table one you have this bag table 2 you will have this bag
you are going to share it
table 3 come to your seats
table 4 come to your seats and then table 5 you start with the cube
you are doing page 5
you re not doing it by yourself page 5 write your name and date
okay table one sit with your partner are you table one table one you and your partner make sure the solids are back in the bag
table 4 put all the solids back in the bag table 2 sit with your partner
table 3 bring your paper with you and your notebook table 4 and 5 sit down
out what is one thing you found out by doing this let me write it down as you re saying it v b has a lot of silhouettes we have . b
so you mean that some solids have more than one silhouette we need to write it down
now i don t want to turn the light off because the camera would not have enough light
okay what else did you find out yes some solids have more than one silhouette yes
j and n j and n okay
curve the solids with curves were more difficult to identify right
silhouettes when i spill it i say sil hou ettes so i can get the sound okay so the ones with difficulty were those that have curves which ones had the most m m does m have any matching solids
0 okay so you also find out that silhouette m has no matching solids anything else that we need to share before we review
yes better okay so silhouette m has no matching solid anything else we need to throw out there before we go by the letters and the numbers that matches
did anybody what silhouette it was going to produce which silhouette it was going to produce anybody else have difficulty with the circle because i saw people coming here to verify it so i can see more than one person s hand up thank you for bringing that up now when you came to verify the silhouette of the circle was it easy to put it on here
no so that one was also problematic because it kept . rolling
question nobody mentioned this how about k k how many people could find a solid for silhouette k
how many people did not identify . put your hands down thank you how many did not identify any solid for silhouette k if your hand did not go up the 1st time your hand needs to be up okay so those of you who could find the solid for silhouette k what solid produced silhouette k one what is the name of the one
name cube the cube how because i know that all the faces of the cube are squares how do we produce a rectangular silhouette yes by standing it on its what on it s what do you call that edge edge thank you
when you rest the cube on its edge it produces a rectangular silhouette which is do you see that now
example example the cube
2 2 which is a square prism the square prism produced silhouette a which shape is that a the number on it is 2
so write 2 on silhouette a if you have not done so prism it s a square prism because 2 of the faces are squares so it s 2 b b had a lot of solids that would produce it
b then the triangular prism which is this one number 12 the triangular prism will produce that shape you see that so put number 12 there number 12
the narrow cylinder which is number 5 the narrow cylinder will produce that too number 5 this narrow cylinder see that the narrow cylinder would produce that did you see it b so we have number 5 number 2
12 number 12 then you have the octagonal prism what the octagonal prism the octagonal prism an octagon has 8 faces remember we did octagon
because the base is an octagon so it has 8 faces so that will also produce that silhouette that we see there so the letter on the number is 3 3 so you write it on b number 3 have you done that and also the hexagonal prism
the hexagonal prism has 6 faces each of those faces would produce that so it s number 9 b number 9 c which solids produced that silhouette number one
which solids produced this silhouette okay so the large cube number one yes anybody else shape number 11 is the large cylinder the wide cylinder the wide cylinder this one
that right okay yes your hand is up so we have 22 solids that would produce c 4 which one shape 4 is square pyramid
we produce . well you re not looking at the right we re looking at c what is c one did it produce next one you have the sides of the square produced which shape produced that c let s put it together they re not the same size
do you see that so this one is a smaller square it should be of this number 6
number we re looking at number one the next one is cylinder the sizes of the square produced are not the same
that this one produced a smaller square so it s a not go with that one so for c you only have the large cube and the wide cylinder square then d you have a square which is number 7 and also the sphere is number 7
the sphere which you called a circle the sphere is number 10 10 the hemisphere is number 7 and then you also have the wide cylinder this one this one the wide cylinder
7 do you have them all 11 10 7 write them down what about 8 8 8 is the cone right no
it we re looking at d it s smaller circles so it doesn t produce d sizes see that one is bigger so this is the big one
it that s why you have to try by coming to the projector now the next one e 12 okay that s the only one and then letter . m 6 which is rectangular prism good then g
7 7 the hemisphere say hemisphere hemisphere half of a sphere okay remember the northern and southern hemisphere the equator cuts the globe into the northern and southern hemispheres right while the prime meridian cuts the earth into eastern and western hemisphere so when you say hemisphere it is half of the sphere
4 4 is the square pyramid and the cone 8 then i the narrow cylinder
edge it s going to produce that rectangular prism and the rectangular prism is 6 6 that s the only one 6 write none
n 0 n e and then n is the hexagonal prism number . 9 good job good job now i have a worksheet for assessment you re going to do this as part of your homework and the homework will be page 6
so you re going to use your big one as well and try to match these solids and the silhouette a practice to help me find out who actually got the lesson and who still needs some extra help so you re going to complete this individually you re not going to work with anybody at home and then bring it back tomorrow morning
cube the pictures of the cube are one 2 3 4 5 match them up by making a line from the silhouette to the solid that s easy yes that s very easy that will help me to make sure
5 ft started we are going to be doing some problems with division today okay i want you to think about what you already know about division
i have a couple pictures i want to show you to kind of get you inspired division it is backwards multiplication it is related to multiplication absolutely it is repeated subtraction it could be repeated subtraction like multiplication is repeated addition
l multiplication and division are related okay opposite it can be hard division can be hard but we will work through that stages it uses grouping
q multiplication will make division easier if you are fluid in your multiplication facts division will be easier for you looking picture number one voices are off
picture what do you notice about these cookies cookies you can divide them you can divide them but what do you notice about these particular cookies cookies do they have anything on them
them some of us might like sugar cookies okay some of us may like these kind better mmmm i told you what do you notice about these cookies
q about all of them have 3 m ms on them some have more some have less but they do have m ms on them and i am sorry but i am one of those people that thinks m ms makes everything better so you take your plain old sugar cookies add some m ms and they are pretty good this is our inspiration today for our division exemplar
you will be working with a partner and in front of you you have your partner cards at this time on level 4 and i would like you to go sit at the back table with ms you at this time i want you to hold up your card look at it and then turn it the other way so people can see it
look at yours okay now let me see how quickly and how silently we can find our partner go silently and quickly
them do they get to be partners okay you are right here with
perfect go have a seat at someone is desk with your partner
i will collect these thank you
j thank you i am glad you are feeling better you excuse me
go 5 4 3 2 one 0 in a 2nd i am going to hand out your exemplars but before we do that i wanted to quickly review how we are going to go about solving our exemplar with our partners
this think of ropes it thanks for sitting up like you are ready to solve this math problem read how many times will you read that problem 3 why in the world would we want to read a problem 3 times
l so you can understand the problem you want to make sure you know what they are asking you so you can solve it correctly and if you only read it once you may have missed something along the way for omit the extra word get rid of those extra words
p problem solving no that is not what that p stands for confused this is where you will choose your problem solving strategy
explain your thinking this is where you will solve your problem but you want to do it efficiently day study your answer good
here are your problem solving strategies look you will not right now because you have not had the problem yet you thank you ms sorry you will not need it
together you all are working together own go have a seat
no we do not sharpen pencils in the middle of math class morning we sharpen 3 pencils so we don t have that problem you know that i like to read this problem out loud to you the 1st time it reading along laura came to school today
along i love m m cookies you just saw the picture and i think most of you love them as well by your reaction batch i put a bag of m ms 45 in all okay into my batter and i baked a dozen cookies 12 you might need to know that
if the m ms are dispersed that means shared as evenly as possible in the cookies how many m ms should each cookie have we know when we are dividing we are creating equal groups
cookies you are going to think about your m ms and try to figure out how many m ms each cookie should have can one cookie have 5 and one cookie have none no can one cookie have 3 and one cookie have 6 no they need to have the same amount
just imagine that you and your siblings were sharing these cookies and your little 4 year old brother comes up to you and says my cookie only has 2 m ms and is cookie has 6 m ms that is not fair so you have got to make it fair
right you and your partner need to take turns rereading this so you make sure you understand the problem then you need to follow ropes and get started go yes madam as much as they need
i want you to think about how much each cookie will have
happens that was just a random picture i got from google
turn around please get busy do not forget that i would love for you to write your strategy
the strategy i used was it needs to be one of these here what is this called bingo your sentence needs to say my strategy was to draw a diagram easy peasy
yes madam what is the strategy guess and check that means you guess how many are on each cookie then you check it
amount this is not appropriate for this problem paper you have got to follow ropes
your next thing that you need to do is figure out which one of these strategies you are going to use to solve your problem
guys if you have a strategy that you have chosen so far from our list of problem solving strategies what strategy have you chosen chosen what have you just done on your paper i did circles we are going to call that a diagram
i would think that a diagram would be the most efficient strategy for this problem diagram i am noticing circles on some friend is papers yes i see circles over here over there
good job now tell me why you did what you did circles because we want to make sure we have an even amount i understand but what do those 12 circles represent
the 12 groups now before you go any further do not leave me hanging sentence the strategy i used was and what was your strategy sentence where it says a dozen cookies i put 12
and i want you to put on your problem solving since you already made that mathematical connection later on when you are ready to finish this problem up i want it to say i know that 12 equals one dozen that is your mathematical connection done you have just got to write it in a sentence that is the key
there may be there may not be but remember alexis is baby brother cannot have more m ms on his cookie
mind yes madam i do not get it how i don t understand i am just curious why all of these have 4 but all of these have 3
when you were putting your little dots which i am assuming represent m ms when you were doing that did you go one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 until you got to 45 then how did 4 stop right here and 3 right here dots i want you to count them one cookie at a time
i do not want you to give them all 4 then 3 you see what i am saying equally remember when we were making the blocks and we put the blocks into groups one block at a time
time what is this right here
okay so you are thinking that each cookie is going to get 3 m ms
leftover you have 36 m ms right 25 so figure out how many are leftover how are you
divide this is why i suggested that drawing a diagram might be the best most efficient strategy for this problem because have we mastered this yet no can we draw a diagram long so why do not you try that and see if that is more helpful for you
that how are you guys doing good we decided to divide 1st then to check our answers we made a diagram with the cookies i like how you are checking your work up here now you have to add your remainder and that should give you 45
can me and get the learning blocks why on all right
do i did 4 groups of 45 and 12 groups i want you start marking and i am going to count for you
have you have 45 total right do you have enough to put one more m m on each cookie enough so what are you going to do see if it is leftover a nice little snack of m ms right
get how many are going to be leftover down how many did we end up adding to the cookies times 12
36 so let us subtract that and see what our remainder ends up being
i hope you are done because we are going to be checking in just a few minutes how did you get 11
regroup you are doing 45 -36 make it a 15 what is 15 -6
6 so now do you have an answer for this algorithm what is your question how many are in each cookie 3 9 all right can you try it another way
9 that is how many m ms are leftover job yes sir this is why i suggested that drawing a diagram was the best way to go because have we mastered this strategy
division my suggestion was to draw 12 cookies or 12 circles or squares hurry you did that and then did you go and just put m ms on each cookie cookie that can not happen
alexis is brother is going to cry that it is not fair we are going to have remainders we are going to have some remainders of m ms amount help him you have got to come over here honey
i might be calling on your group to share and since you are having such a good time i am assuming you are ready to share you are having too much fun to not have an answer yet answer i do not see a sentence that says there are blank m ms on each cookie yet we were trying to do a chart that might not be the best way
this is the most efficient strategy and this is another strategy good is that enough ways are you good you do not need to do that good i think you need to start with this because we have not gotten into long division yet
okay we are lost right here that is not an efficient strategy for this problem is we are going to spend some times sharing in just a 2nd like right now go i am ready to see the answers that you came up with
the 1st thing i want to know i am going to ask that you stop working for just a minute and begin listening the 1st thin i want to know is the strategy you used 1st strategy used a t chart at 1st and then it did not work too good so then we did a diagram i love that
l our 1st strategy was a t chart it was not good then we started our diagram we are so used to jumping into t charts t charts can solve many problems in the world i am convinced but they can not solve all the problems in the world this particular problem that was not the most efficient strategy so you dumped it and got a new strategy
absolutely so her strategy was to draw a diagram that was probably the most efficient strategy for this particular problem like we had the 12 cookies does this have to be art class
no but we made a key though i like the way you think diagram this took me how many seconds sufficient how many cookies did you have i had 12
can someone read me the sentence with the m ms l i put a bag of m ms 45 in all into the batter and baked a dozen cookies
dozen because i saw a period what does a dozen mean it means 12 so everybody has 12 cookies is that right that is your mathematical connection remember when we get to this box it says con for mathematical connection wondering i love m m cookies is not a mathematical connection
my mom makes the best m m cookies is not a mathematical connection knowing that 12 equals a dozen is a mathematical connection that is why and i hop everybody else put 12 cookies l what was your next step after you have drawn this diagram
he did this 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 then maybe some of you kept going until you got to 45 but what ended up happening 9 leftover if you kept going you were going to get 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 then these 3 cookies did not get that extra m m that no it is not fair
so what i suggest is that you stop at 36 far that is what we did over here we had to be careful i suggest you stop at 36 and then just have some m ms leftover you can eat those later or maybe mom can eat those since she worked so hard baking the cookies
could you use another strategy at this point yes
i wanted a chart because i was thinking about how i was thinking about my math if i go around one time that would be 12 because i know one times 12 is 12
48 it is higher than 45 45 so each cookie is going to have 3 yes and how many m ms are going to be leftover
9 9 what m ms q i did that and then after i tried to check it because the s in ropes means study and check you results
good okay can i write down on the board what i did please by all means
sir i knew that i had 12 cookies so then i did 12 times 3 which was my answer and it gave me 36 then i added 36 +9 and it gave me 45
cookies i am going to go ahead and label it for you okay 3 m ms per cookie gives you a total of 36 m ms remember you have 9 leftover which gives you 45 beginning i put 3 with 9 leftover that is perfect
now in an exemplar what we would want you to do is to write a sentence with your answer in it each what cookie
has how many leftover 9
leftover what do we call that in division when something is leftover vocabulary yes
if you realize over the if you did when you are done if you wanted to you could do the division sign and i did it and it came up with that okay a lot of people wanted to do this
you got stuck because we have not mastered this strategy yet right week that is fine if you are strong in this but not everybody is so this is why i did not want you to start with the algorithm
i wanted you to start with something you understood which was drawing a diagram but if you are loving this we already figured out it is 3
36 36 and when you subtract that you are going to get 9
be all right i would like for you to wrap up any little things you want to add really quick to your exemplar i know a few people are still working it are you surprised did you get it right that is a good surprise
i am going to teach you a strategy to help you with that but not yet yet all right if you will make sure your name is on your paper before you hand it to me we are going to take them up in order
okay that is not going to work i am closed in h thank you dear
is over here i am still working that is okay
m may i have your paper please
you put your name on your paper dear okay i would like for everyone to come back to their seats looking for that level 4 transition
the shape is yellow so it s difficult to see forward raise your hand to tell me anyway you can think of to name this shape polygon it s got straight sides more than 2 of them and they are all closed it how else you can describe this shape
a rhombus or a diamond it is not a rhombus of you look close diamond it s not a rhombus because it s not a square stretched out parallel in order for it to be a rhombus the sides have to be parallel and they are not d a parallelogram listen
parallel see this side and this side if i stretch this side out and i stretch this side will they cross each other
mean it means you could it s got 90 degrees it s 90 degrees thank you and c
good 1st thing we re going to do is round a number i d like you to write on your white board the number 23 and 15 hundredths 23 and 15 hundredths round to the nearest whole number
do me a favor can you get over there a white board and a marker for him very good job
place there is a one next to it so you kept the number 23 good so 23 is the correct answer number i ll give you the digits and the places and you have to put them together so and they are going to be out of order so you need to figure out how many places you need
it i am not going to fit the th digits is there a decimal no yes look at it carefully
a 3 tenths 510s 600s and 2 hundredths let me see i see some people with the correct answer
watch i have what is my highest place value my biggest place value 600s 5 tenths the 6 which is in which place 100s 100s so if i have 100s how many digits are in the whole number multiple students 33123 do i have a decimal yes how do you know g cause there s tenths and hundredths very good i have those ths decimal if i have tenths and hundredths how many places after the decimal 2
2 so your answer needs to have 5 digits once you ve come up with your 5 places then put in the numbers how many 100s 100s how many
6 how many 100s 66 how many 10s 5 how many ones 00 you need to remember to put in those zeroes for place values you don t have tenths 33 how many hundredths 2 so your answer should have looked like this
a lot of you put 65 and 32 hundredths it has to be 650 and 32 hundredths let s do an expanded i ll give you a number you have to give it to me 2 other ways
comma yes yes because every 3 digits every period is separated with a comma
you should ve written 9526 and then you wrote 9000 +500 +20 +6 and i think just about everybody had it right
thing last night for homework you did workbook page 65 i checked it as you came up to me today geometry you had to draw and label different things i would like you to draw for me on your whiteboard point c
c it does not have to be connected to a line no no as long as i have labeled it somewhere it should not be connected to anything a point is one spot in space
space now i d like you to take point c and turn it into line segment cd take your point c and turn it into line segment cd
points the arrows mean it goes on and on forever segment because it keeps going no not because it keeps going a because it doesn t keep going it starts at what number
01 through 1012 it starts with 0 inches 111212 so that s why it would ve been a line segment now i want you to take line segment cd and i want you to turn it into ray cd
cd it s a ray how many endpoints on a ray multiple students one do i know which one s the endpoint no cd do i know which one s the endpoint no a ray has one endpoint remember we talked about this yesterday you name it by its 1st letter
it starts at c and goes through d and goes on and on forever turn ray cd into line cd
who can tell me how do i tell the difference between a line and a line segment s very good but how can i tell that that s what happened what looks different when i draw a line and when i draw a line segment right a line segment stops at starts somewhere and stops somewhere
c a line has an arrow very good so your straight path with 2 arrows it s got a point on either side
no they are just 2 places on the line that that straight path follows
do you have her marker no that s my marker she thinks it s hers it s mine do you have a marker do you have a marker solved today we re going to talk about angles
right as we did our calendar we talked about the angles of the triangle already all right who can tell me what do you think the definition for angle is
i isn t it like the right angle obtuse angle and the like the part of the direction well you are right but you are telling me an angle is a right angle an obtuse angle but i don t know what angle means is they are types of angles but i want to know what is an angle r the corner of something it s like a corner
good and like an angle is something that goes in different directions like a bent line it s kind of like a line that s bent like a corner like said when we re going to talk about angles we re going to talk about 2 rays that have one endpoint watch when i draw a picture of an angle here s my endpoint
this angle point b point a ray has one endpoint and then what
direction so watch i am going to draw one here and i am going to put a point on it not because a line is a ray is it doesn t go backwards
it has one staring point so i can only name a ray one way now i am going to make another ray and that s ray bc bc yeah right here in between what do i call that
angle the space between 2 rays that are connected at one point that s the angle we re going to practice measuring angles today we re going to practice naming them and measuring them
if i were to name this angle i would do i could name it angle abc or angle cba or just angle b
it those are the only 3 ways that i am going to name this angle pattern i could name it abc angle cba or just angle b
v while the a and c are switching the b is still in the right still in the same place the b is always in the middle
it i call this point the point where those 2 rays meet is called a vertex i have heard that you ve heard of it before it you might have heard of it in 3rd grade when you did geometry the vertex is the point that forms the angle
meet when i am naming an angle it always has to be in the middle or if i am only using one letter it has to be the vertex
and i would say this name angle abc angle cba or just angle b make sense now we talked about right angles
angle how do i know it s right angle angle cause when you have a right hand well i could do it on my left hand or my right hand it s a right angle either way because it forms a square
angle this is a right angle angle it could be in any direction but it s still called a right angle me it has to have 90% and not 90% 90
90 degrees degrees does that mean if i touch this i am going to burn my finger hot he s right it is 90 degrees because i measure angles in degrees but it s not temperature circle i am going to give you a tool today and we re going to practice measuring and naming angles
is it s that little thing that goes it s a protractor it looks like a rainbow protractor we re going to use this to measure angles 2 i am giving you one like this that you can t keep forever
one i am giving you one like this and we re going to look at it because it s similar to the one i have and i am also giving you one that you get to take home and you get to keep in your desk that i put on an overhead thing this and this are the same
protractors we re going to start today with this 11 you have a real big protractor it i do not know you don t do anything with it make sure one of these stays on s desk will you give one to
that is an excellent thing to look up i am sorry if you are talking can you hear what he s saying
j is it circumference it and you are right radius and all that has to do with measures in a circle angles 1st thing i want you to do is look at your protractor
chart because it s very important that you hold it the right way lights take a look at your protractor
in order to make sure that you are using your protractor the right way you have to be able to read the 90 if it looks like this oop you can t see it if it looks like this is that 90 no no that tells me it s backwards
over make sure you can read the number 90 it yes has to be this way neighbor make sure there s looks like mine and that you see a 90
it notice if i were to trace the 90 degree line i would start well let me show you this way when i am measuring angles it depends on where the angle is if i am using the bottom set of numbers or if i am using the top set of numbers
different look at your protractor if you can t see mine what s different about the numbers that go across the top and the numbers on the bottom different opposite they are opposite the bottom number start at 0 and move to the left and the top numbers have 0 over here and get bigger as we move to the right
when i measure and angle the vertex that point right in the middle i always have to make sure that the very center of my protractor is on the vertex
correctly after i have done that i have to make sure that one of the rays follows the line that goes to 0 minute so one of them has to follow this line let s say i am measuring an angle that measures 90 degrees look what the angle is going to look like
if i put it on a pitch of a 90 degree angle look at 90 degrees does that form your square angle
yes yes and that s why it s 90 degrees i am going to give you a page that looks like let s do this one
this it s double sided so you are going to have to flip and find the side that says angles and identify each type of angle shown and we re going to practice together measuring angles using the protractor
are we going to have to like measure and see if we are going to measure it and we re going to name them i am going to teach you names for different angles which most of you already know
make sure one of these stays on s desk and one of these needs to go to special this is directions for how to measure angles there s a picture of a protractor and an explanation of what i just showed you on the board
so in case you forget you have it here again and again one of these has to stay on s desk and this is going to be neat for you
math 0 cool did i give you one of these give one of those to
together together are we ready disruptive i got one extra did you leave one on s desk so you have an extra one too i got one extra anybody missing one
one all right so if you forget as you are doing your work here s extra directions for you for using the protractor look at the 1st example on the board on your paper the directions says identify each type of angle shown and estimate the angle s measurement one before you do that show me your right angle with your hand
a right angle measures how many degrees 9090 that s a right angle now if i make it like this is that bigger or smaller than a right angle smaller it s smaller do you remember what we said yesterday we call a small angle
little so an acute angle is less than 90 degrees what if i told you to spread your hand out like this and make a real wide
obtuse obtuse is bigger than 90 degrees what if i gave you an angle and this one you might not know what if i gave you an angle that looked like this
that this is an angle abc what kind of angle is that it obtuse well it is obtuse but it has a special name because it s actually a straight line
it multiple students line not a line but it is one of those 2 words a line segment straight line a straight angle
if you look at your protractor if you look at your protractor if i were to go straight across the bottom how many degrees is a straight angle a straight line
0 no i start at 0 a 180 it s 180 degrees it s 2 90 degree angles 180 degrees so i have and we ll add these to our chart a little later
than 60 less than multiple students 9090 and what did we say about obtuse
more than 90 degrees now back to our page looking at the 1st angle how can i look at this and know it s acute without measuring it
know because it s smaller than a right angle because it s not straight up and down it s smaller than a right angle acute now how did the how were they able to estimate 45 degrees why didn t they pick 90 degrees or 120 degrees they said it was acute
a cause an acute has smaller degrees than 90 good and doesn t this look like it s about halfway between a square corner and a straight line and then they named the angle why did they name it def and not efd
e i also could ve named it fed as long as this point what did i say we called that vertex straight line the vertex is in the middle angle raise your hand and tell me what do you think it is do you think it s acute obtuse or right
why because it s straight it makes that square corner so we re going to start by circling right
19090 and then how are we going to name it
this you make the angle shape 1st xyz it get your protractor make sure that 90 is facing up
okay if you are not reading 90 if it looks backwards your protractor is the wrong way
vertex i want you to line up this point in the very center of your protractor put that right on top so you can look through and see point y i can look right through my protractor and see point y
so you are going to put this point right there in the corner can you go through it can you do what can you go do what we re doing this one says i am teaching you how to measure angles too because on the back you are going to have to actually measure them
so once you ve put your protractor so that you can look through and see point y the next thing i need to do is make this line across the bottom even with this line ray yz
to you see how now my ray follows that bottom line sense if i am measuring this angle now am i using the bottom numbers starting at 0 or should i use the top numbers
top should i start at 0 or start at a big number 0 because the bottom ray is going this way i know i need to use the bottom numbers i am going to follow these numbers till i reach my ray my other ray and it lines up with 90 degrees so you can see it s a 90 degree angle
sense go to the next one would you say that this angle is acute obtuse or right obtuse explain why you are saying obtuse
obtuse look at our definitions corner an acute is smaller than 900 it s obtuse because it s big because it s big
back all right before we circle anything take your protractor make sure 90 is facing up and lineup that point in the center with vertex q
that got to move this point here so that goes right over q
point you are going to have to keep it there and move your protractor so that the bottom line the 0 line matches up with ray qr but the vertex has to stay covered see you got it
h once you ve done that now you want to turn it so that this bottom line is lined up with that ray what if i go on ahead a little bit we re still practicing the angles it show me how to measure this angle
you guys if you are going ahead and doing the other ones i don t have a problem with you going ahead however you need to be able to measure angles you see this point right here in the center that has to go on q and then this line across the bottom has to line up with 0
it see this point right here q and then this line that goes across the bottom has to follow this ray that did you get it
me 0 yes show me now if i follow this line this ray ray qr for those of you going ahead please stop and look if i follow ray qr am i using the bottom numbers or the top ones top bottom why
why bottom cause you have to start there i have to start at 0 so i am following the bottom numbers until i reach ray qp
here i am using the bottom numbers which tells me this angle is how many degrees 12120 how else besides knowing that i have to start at 0 and use the bottom numbers how else would i know i was wrong if i said the answer was 60 degrees how else would i know that that would be wrong
e because when it s straight and then points at 0 not 180 there s another reason though there s another reason you are using the bottom because i am using the bottom numbers but there s another way i d know obtuse if it measures 60 degrees is that obtuse no so it has to be more than 90 which is the 120 on the bottom
so you ve circled obtuse it pqr or good so i can call this angle rqp
correct before you finish flip it over to the back estimates 1st one they tell you is 58 degrees when i look at that angle can you see that it s acute
yes yes because it s smaller than 9090 degrees it s smaller than a right angle it here s where it gets a little tricky is this like the other ones where the line is going straight across one take your protractor again make sure that you can read the 90
over the point some of you are confused with this part the point right here t yeah this dot right in the middle this point right in the middle should go right on top of the vertex the corner point
it do i have it right on top of the vertex no no i need to turn the protractor the protractor this line that goes across the bottom has to be lined up with one of these 2 rays
it let s see i ll turn it this way before you see my protractor where i have the point right here
yes al i did was turn the whole protractor so that this long line was met up with my ray
do take your whole paper and turn it so that this is straight instead now all i need to do is put my protractor right on top
so i can either turn my paper or i can turn the protractor it is your bottom line lined up with 0 protractor put the point right there
now once you ve done that turn it so that the line is matched up here what little lines what little lines this one like how do you know if like it s like coming from like 0 i ll show you i ll show you
when i measure this angle i am going to use what time i need to figure out where my angle ends so i am going to follow follow follow follow follow follow follow follow follow follow all the way up to here
no how do i know it has to be between 50 and 60 though how do i know that this is between 50 and 60 degrees it s not between 120 and 130 i ecause it s not touching the lines yeah but it s not touching the line even if it s between 50 and 60
because it has to be less than 90 here so if i am starting at 50 this is the question you asked it s 51 52 53 54 55 56 about how many degrees
577 degrees 0 they said 58 58 if i had said it s like 75 degrees i am way off if you are within a couple of degrees you are okay because these lines are a little short 57 all right i d like you to try on your own to measure this angle
is it going to be more or less than 90 degrees less less which makes it acute as soon as you have a measurement for this raise your hand for number 6 show me this is number 6 not 62
it you got to turn it now so this line touches this i can t measure like that because you see my line that goes to 0
rays i have to line up the 0 line to touch a ray it so that one of those rays follows that bottom line
a did i get it right we re doing this one we re doing this one if you see the person next to you is struggling if you can help them show them how to hold the protractor that would be perfect
you are fine did you get it you don t have a pencil you are welcome show me
like just show me like this and like that a right angle looks like this
is this a lot smaller or a little smaller than 90 degrees a lot smaller a lot smaller right it i was going like this if you ve gotten the 2nd one you can go on and try another one
right you ve got to put that on the 1st but you have to turn it so that this line lines up with one of these thing like the bottom number now measure it
50 let me see what you got right here show me see let me see what you got for number 2
what did you get for number 2 and then follow it out 0 okay so you are using which numbers
160 i am confused you got it is this right i am on number 3 missus h do it try 3 the same way you did this one mine has a smudge it s 2 numbers it should be between 2 numbers get show me
all right most of you had around the same answer 1st what some of you said 18 22 some of you said 23 24
vertex i have lined up the 0 line with this ray if i follow the bottom numbers my answer has to be between 20 and 30 it s about here which would make my answer somewhere between
2323 and 24 so i would accept 22 23 24 maybe even 25 the important thing to remember is to line up the bottom number work turn the lights back on
want you guys missus h i don t understand yes are these supposed to be equivalent or something yes well no they are not equivalent 50 if i am measuring this way it would be a big angle going this way
okay missus h i get it now good you are going to work at your desk to finish this page me this me you guys are working at your seat to measure the angles
you may work with someone up to 3 people to measure the angles agree let me get my paper you can work up to 3 with up to 3 people
all right you guys so i saw you having a hard time measuring angles
take a look at number 3 do you see number 3 now when i think about a right angle it s a square point like this angle if i take that angle and i make it smaller it s going to measure below 90 degrees you understand that part
is this going to be more or less than 90 degrees less less and i know that because it s not like this and it s not laying back between so take your protractor i already know just from looking at this angle it s going to be less than 90 degrees take your protractor you see this point in the center
i want you to put it right in the point where those 2 line segments meet in number 3 and it doesn t matter what direction your paper s in that yes now if you haven t done this you need to see you see this line across the bottom you see it
mistake this line across the bottom has to line up with either this ray or this ray so if i put it like this is my line touching either one of these rays no so i am going to need to turn the whole thing and i am going to keep turning until this line and this line are right on top of each other
it now follow the line where it s matched up stop you touch 0 that means i am using the bottom numbers because i want to use 0 yours is upside down you got to flip it
ray the 2nd part of the angle it follow that all the way up it s but we re not using 130 because we re starting with the bottom numbers
numbers now we re starting with the bottom numbers hand we re going to follow this ray now all the way up when i follow that ray all the way out it s between what 2 numbers 140 show me
where i do not know look this one this other ray up follow this one all the way up your protractor s upside down ine yeah which is going to make it very hard
90 it s between 50 out go like this it 0 60 when i follow this all the way out it s between 50 and 60
so what is this angle measuring 50 it s not 50 because it s a little bit see it s a little bit above 5060 is it that high above 59 watch 51 if i follow this line and you are welcome to do this if you need to
paper that measure angle that angle measures about 59 teacher is it that far up 52 put it back on and see if you can see that it s 51 or 52 when you follow this all the way up to the bottom numbers it s about 52
see it s above 50s would it have made sense for me to say that it s like 132 no no because i said it s acute right 132 so that angle is about 50 between 50 and 52
this all right look at the next angle one look at number 4 is that angle acute or obtuse because it s wide it s a wide angle minutes so take your protractor
line up your point with the vertex to 0 and then line you got it 0 you got it lined up
155 about how much does this angle measure 155 make sre your lining up one of these 2 rays 145150 you think 150
what do you think do you have this line that lined up is 160 or 150 turn your paper like this now remember this line has to line up with one of those rays say a 151 what do you think
a 150 follow it all the way up do 53 a 153 what do you think write it down try it again
up a 153 nothing s easy the 1st time you try it 153 you got 152 153 a 151 a 151 what do you think
it s 150 smaller the answer 155 would be correct correct a little less than 160 could be correct
153 is correct and you said 153 is correct correct the thing you need to remember is to line this up across one of those 2 rays more you and i will practice it some more later but look at me put your hands away from your head you need to come with a positive attitude if you are coming and you ve already given up then i am not going to be able to help you
okay so we ll work again later and you will come with a positive attitude right yes okay all right my friends bring these back to your seats we ll work again later
yours all right tomorrow you guys we re going to do more practice with measuring angles now come on back to your seats and give me 5
i have to say i am impressed with the way the people who were working here were working together some of you i can see you are still struggling and we ll talk about it again tomorrow tonight for homework i am going to give you an angle sheet and you can take your protractor home and try to measure however the worksheet itself doesn t say measure it just says tell whether it s acute obtuse or right but i would like you on that worksheet to still tell me what the measure is
that way when i check it tomorrow i ll have a better idea of who really doesn t get it and who figured it out and will almost guarantee if you go home and you are stil confused and your parents help you you will probably understand it better tomorrow than you did today what practice practice practice practice and i ll tell you i didn t know how to use a protractor the 1st time i tried it
it what if your dad is like sleeping a lot and your mom doesn t know then you will do your best and we ll talk about it more tomorrow right yeah i did too tonight keep your rules for using a protractor your protractor and this worksheet that you have right now in your math folder and i ll pass out the one you are doing for homework in a few minutes
excuse me 12
here over here way excuse me here move from here
no move to another space you see the yes
1231st warning for you
now everybody received a slate and we re going to use the lesson is about we re going to do shorter partner partner everybody here you are to a few shorter partner shorter partner shorter and a few you work together
now you should have your composition book by you and everybody by this time should have gotten your pencil ready
it s amazing why we re not having our composition books with us us it s amazing that s one for you
now the lesson we have today comes from the standard we have on the board everybody should understand what the standard is by now and that is what the school system wants every student to know
what we do we take a little bit of it we break it up and because you can t teach everything at the same time from this so today i took from there so makes what numbers with 90% at that is almost everybody in the classroom or everyone should be able to do
if i give you for example 5 questions you should not get less than one wrong everybody should almost get the questions right now i have vocabulary words here in proper order
i m going to add in proper order fraction an improper fraction is a fraction that has a numerator greater than the denominator for example 7 over what 2 it is also you also have an improper fraction where n is equal to what
d that is you have the numerator equal to the denominator for example 4 over what 4 over 4 so in this case when you divide the numerator by the denominator your answer is always going to be equal to one or greater than what one in those 2 cases you have what is called an improper fraction
a proper fraction on the other hand is when you have the numerator smaller than the what the denominator so for example 2 over 52 over 5 is an example of a proper fraction what fraction in this case where you divide the numerator and the denominator your answer will always be less than what
something to reduce some of us know that from your 4th grade and 3rd grade to reduce means that you have to make sure that your 2 factors your fraction does not have a common factor factor a number that can divide the numerator and a number that can divide the denominator
in this case there s a common factor of what 22 can be divided by 2 and 6 can also be divided by what 2 if you see this one it s because one is a what a 3rd 3 now one 3 can only be divided with one number one when you get to that level then you stop
fraction we call it if you look at it it says lowest m what simplifying so basically those are the things that we have to remember
so the number to the right hand side when you subtract is called the and the number to the left when you subtract is called the what the most of the time it is best if this number on the left is greater than what
right if not you re going to have a minus what answer for example 2 -42 -4 because 2 is much smaller your answer is going to be what
2 so i m going to leave all this information on improper fractions and we re going to need the information it s very important what i failed to put there mixed what numbers a mixed number is a number that has a whole number and it also has what
fraction for example 2 and one half is a mixed number 2 is the what number and you have the fraction these are some of the things you were supposed to know from 4th grade also so we re going to use all of this to do what we re supposed to do today
if you can do what we re supposed to do today a lot of your problems with fractions will have been solved because this is one area where some students have some challenges steps i ll show you what good mathematicians do when they subtract what mixed numbers the 1st thing they do they subtract the whole what
numbers they subtract the whole numbers 1st when they subtract the whole number they must make sure that like when i told you for example 2 2 4 -3 one 4
let s put the 2 4 on this side and one 4 on this side you can see that this is not feasible to do what do i mean by feasible you can see that the 2 is smaller than the what 3 it is smaller than the 3 you cannot do this so you know that you cannot subtract in that case because if you do subtract your answer is going to be what
negative that is why i put it here if visible visible so always look at your whole numbers your whole numbers of the mixed number if the one on the left is greater than the one on the right then you what subtract after that you ll be left with the fraction so let s take the questions one by one
we have for example let s look at the question i m going to do this from this is my time right now
after you subtract the whole numbers then check the left hand fraction is greater than the if it is greater than the one on the right what you do you re going to cross what multiply cross multiply this is one of the easiest ways to subtract ways the only problem that you re going to have is that you may have to reduce
yes don t you do the while you just add and subtract adding and subtracting and comparing of fractions fractions so now 1st we re going to subtract the whole numbers 2 we re going to check if the fraction on the left is greater than the fraction on the what on the right
if it is so then we re going to take we re going to subtract by cross what multiplying then after we cross multiply we re going to multiply the what the denominators the denominators after you multiply the denominators you re going to solve now for your what for your answer as you are solving for your answer your final answer must not be in the form of what
your final answer must not be in the form of improper what fraction if you have an improper fraction you must reduce it to what number and how you do that you divide your 7 by 22 you have what 3 this would be 6 and you have a remainder of what
number you write the quotient what 1st we re going to use q to stand for the quotient we re going to use remainder and we re going to use d to stand for the what the divisor
here you have your q which is 322 it become 31 half we don t have to go into to check into changing lesson we re going to do a lesson where you re going to be changing mixed numbers into what
fractions so that is for the final what step if you had an answer for example like 4 over 12 you can not leave your answer as 4 over 12 because there s a common factor between 4 and what 12 you can 4 is a common factor because 4 can divide what
3 so these are some of the things that you must now do as you try to add mixed what numbers let s take an example the 1st example let s look at the 1st example the 1st example is excuse me
3 4 that s not a very good question because if we do that we might not be able to get the answer the way i want to get it 7 one 2 -3 one 3 steps let s follow the steps the 1st step a good mathematician would take is to look at the whole numbers and what
subtract so we re going to take 7 and look at 3 subtract yes because 7 is greater than what 3 so we re going to take 7 and we re taking what 34 now so we ve taken away the 7 and we ve taken away the what 3 what do we have left
half we have one 2 and we have what 13rd now you re going to look at 2 fractions to see if the fraction on the left is greater than the fraction on the what on the right
how do you do that you compare the 2 of them you take one half and you have 13rd you cross multiply and 3 is what 32 so you know that one half is greater than what 13rd so you can go now and cross what multiply so now you re going to take one times 3 is 3
sign 2 times one is 2 what multiply the what the denominator the denominators what are the denominators 6 you re going to subtract now numerators 2 from 3 is what
denominator what is is one 6 the answer now 4 so our final answer is 4 and what 16th 4 and one 6
now let s try one more question then let s do one question together let s do one question together let s take question let s do one question here let s say 4 one 2 -one and what
2 3 this question we can solve it but it s going to give us a little bit of a problem and i m going to try to the problem why because i can cross check and i see that 2 is greater than what one half in this case it s going to give us a problem so let s try to see
to when you have the right fraction greater than the left fraction what do you do you have to what follow and do some multiplication so that you can solve the problem so let s try another one with the left side is greater than the what
1434 -6 one 2 do subtract the whole numbers we subtract the what the whole numbers what are the whole numbers here
the 14 and the 6 the 14 and the 6 so we re going to take the 6 from what 14 when we take 6 from 14 what is the answer 8 okay now 6 from 14 becomes what
one 2 now we re going to what cross multiply before we cross multiply let s check if the left fraction is greater than the what the right fraction 64 times what is what 4 so we know that 3 4 is greater than what one half
multiply so let s cross multiply 3 times 2 is 6 we keep our what minus sign 4 times one is 4 and we go to the 3rd what the 3rd point that good mathematicians would take do what would they do at the 3rd point
they d multiply the denominator they d multiply the denominators what are the denominators here 4 and 24 and 2 what 8 now we re going to take and this is a very good question
question let s see why i said it s going to be a very good question because it s going to challenge what we re supposed to do in the 4th what in the 4th step 2 and we keep our denominator which is 2 over what 8 is that the answer no you have to reduce we have to reduce we have to reduce
reduce 2 divided by 2 it s 14th and the answer is 8 so we divide 2 by 21 we divide again 8 by what 2
no it s 814814814 very good 814 because excuse me everybody everyone everyone going to get a marker now the next 3 questions you re going to do with your what
partner i m going to tell you the question you re going to do so what is the the guiding line is you must follow the what you must follow the steps
you must follow the steps as you work with your partner steps i want everybody i want you to turn to your partner and excuse me one and 2
you turn to your partner right now and you share the good steps partner a everybody take a letter a or b
okay partner b you will share with partner a the 1st 2 steps that good mathematicians take in solving problems with subtracting mixed numbers
steps excuse me
share b was supposed to share the 1st 2 steps that good mathematicians take in solving that is in subtracting mixed numbers now a will share with b the last 2 steps that good mathematicians take in the same procedure
b who is b a you re supposed to share with her right now the last 2 steps
mark one more time you re going to take a time out of the class we re going to do question number 16
14 and we re going to also do question let s see another good question there that you can do that would not give you any problem
i think question number 6 so let s see let me try question number 61st
1614 and 16 together with your partner
one excuse me please don t call my name
hand call my name you won t get any marker any more if you do it one more time
me everybody should be following the steps steps step one i should hear you discuss that with your partner for step one
then step 23 and 4 excuse me me you do the questions that i put there for you to do
now i m on 2 have a seat right here get one of these which page are you on
16 get your composition book any more what kind of is that so what should really be your answer you re putting 0 for 16 what should really be your answer your answer should just be what
your answer should be what 3 just 3 okay if you have this one here right so all of this would be 0 so your answer would just be what 33 this would just become 3
what was your what was this one here 16 subtract the whole numbers what is the 1st question for what is the 1st step that you re going to take problem okay you got the 6 right now you re left with what
2 thirds and what so you have what after you subtract it you have 5 over 12 so what is your final answer correct which problem is this 114 what is the 1st thing that you did
i i mean you took what from what left 3 what did you do after that i multiplied 4 times 7 let me see the question question 14
4 i don t know how you got 8 here 0 i i don t know how you got 8 okay this way you have what
32 excuse me please her you follow the steps over there i don t know if you are following the steps
what is the 1st step here what is the 1st step there subtract the whole numbers and what are the whole numbers the whole numbers are 4 and one okay so what fraction do you have left 3 fourths and where is that 7 coming from
7 you take this one and what the 3 you have to 3 which question is this 114 okay what is your 1st step that you took
1st i did 0 yeah 1st i subtract the whole numbers and i got 3 huh and then i multiplied 3 times 4 and then 4 times how did you get 24 over 16 i did because where did 24 come from
sign is that a subtraction sign or addition sign added 12
now in group 4 everybody listen i was amazed at i deliberately put question 14 there hoping that somebody going to discover something in question 14 and in the whole class nobody discovered it
14 you have after you subtracted your mixed your whole numbers what kind of fraction did you have left me 3 you don t some of you don t group 4 group 4 i think we should respect ourselves when someone is talking everyone else should listen
you have you have the following problem for question 14 and nobody was i was walking around you got an answer right i m not saying that your answers were not right but you re going the long what the long way
question it says question 14 says what it says 7 what is it 34434 minus what 13 what 34 let me pick on somebody
let me use my popsicle stick to pick on someone to serve it that was and it was technically a part of question number you will solve that problem on the board and everybody be everyone pays attention including
i m going to take every even if that one belongs to you i m going to take it away from you in a minute if you don t pay attention in the class okay solve that problem over there excuse me please solve the problem
okay 4 take away one is 3 and then i copied it back down go ahead it would be nice if we d just be quiet
you re going to get i m going to call the office answer 0 over 2 i mean 0 over 16
how did you get okay 0 over so the basic concept of math this one should be what what 3 your answer should only be 3 now almost everyone in the classroom did the cross multiplication and that is not what math is all about
math is being able to determine and use your sometimes when you have a mathematical problem you have to use your previous what experiences to see how you can solve the problem in a better way
you had the problem 3 over 33 over 4 -3 over 4 what does 3 over 4 -3 over 4 mean to you yes is 3 over 4 equal to 3 over 4 so you take 3 over 4 from 3 over 4 what do you have left
0 so you did not have to what cross you did not have to cross what multiply what kind of fraction do you have here fractions that s what you have there the like fractions are what what are like fractions
same excuse me take an easy time out from the class now when the denominators are the same you have you have what you call like what here and when you have a common when you have the same that is like fractions you only deal with the what
top so for example if you have 3 like in that problem there 3 over 4 minus what 3 over 4 you did 3 over 3 you have what 0 it s common sense common sense you have an apple that is split into what 4 parts 3 will fit there and you came and you took 3 of them out nothing left any more
so everybody go to question number what 16 and you and your partner again you do question number 16
if you have already finished if you and your partner have already finished the question number 16 i m coming to give you another page
16 yeah everybody here finished question 16
i don t hear you following the steps that you are supposed to take in each of the problems steps excuse me
me did you finish question one
now everybody you forget about the paper that i gave to you
board table 5 you forget about the paper i gave to you and do the 3 questions i m going to put on the board 173 fourths -218 question one i know someone s going to ask me the question what are we doing right now
i have just told you that you disregard the paper that i just gave to you and you do the questions that are on the board
step excuse me me can you move over to group one
times go over to group 11 excuse me can somebody come and take devon from my class
university excuse me can you follow the 1st step
what is the 1st step that is there subtract the whole numbers what are the whole numbers 7 then take what from what 7 from 2 not 7 from 2 it s 2 from 7 left 5 so what is the fraction that you have left now
5 no 3 fourths and 18th and then you multiply 8 times 3 it s 24 step you re supposed to what
what cross multiply what are you cross multiplying what fractions are you cross multiplying 3 fourths can you write that down is talking about you write the 2 fractions you write them down don t worry very soon you will be doing independent work
it excuse me class one more time who you talking to teacher l is this how we do the 1st one okay we reduce it to 20 and then and we got 5 eighths very good very good very good 20 and 32
are you on question 2 no question one you re still on one you told me we got to reduce what question are you on i m on question 2 i thought what did you do there that is not the answer because you did not complete the steps
you re supposed to reduce you have 20 over 32 it s 55 and one half
that s the answer what number are you doing here what is this
32 divided by 232 divided by 2 is 6
doing number one what is this here what is 12 20 23 can 12 be divided by 2 yes can 20 be divided by 2
yes then why did you say the answer should be that and the answer is not 6 over 10 either because there s still a common factor between 6 and 10 i wonder why the 2 of you cannot detect that common factor between 20 and 32
together the answer is not 20 over 32
know you have to reduce okay 12
all pencils down i want to call on the students to share their answers the next 3 questions you re going to solve them by yourself excuse me i want to call on a student to come to the board and solve question one on the board i m using my popsicle sticks and the person is board excuse me there should be silence in the classroom
you use a marker over there i don t know what group 4 is doing do you did not tell us your 1st step that you took
okay when you divided 20 by 4 what did you get when i divided 20 by 4 i got 5 and when you divided 32 by 4 what did you get 8 so why am i seeing 280 i messed it up
good now everybody your markers should be closely neatly covered right now this is not the time you re going to be doing this is your individual practice right now
now we going to individual practice and it goes into your composition book your math composition book question everybody you go into your math composition book on a fresh page a fresh page
you re writing subtraction of mixed numbers with the date and you re doing the following problems own what did i just say
the 1st question individual practice no more sharing at this time
steps step one you do that 1st before you go to step 2 before 3 and your final step
the questions that you are doing are on the board the questions that you are doing are on the board there s a reason why i m emphasizing that
step 18 -5 okay you got 13 right yes what next i have to cross multiply 3 times 7 is 218 times one is 8 what kind of a fraction is that i had to divide what kind of a fraction is this fraction a fraction where you have the numerator greater than the denominator what kind of fraction is that
a proper fraction so why do you have to reduce when you have a proper fraction
excuse me over there what is this
where did this 5 come from where did this 5 come from don t all of you go to the office if you don t want to go over there go to the office
is that for your cross multiply okay when you cross multiply that and that what did you get 20 equals 32
what 18 what is the 1st step what are we supposed to do with the 1st step you have to subtract the whole numbers okay and when you did that when you took 5 from 18 what did you get 3 you took 5 from 18 and you got 3 up okay now what fraction do you have left
what you have 78s and 7 out of 8 you have 13rd okay so you cross multiply and you ve got what you ve got 21 subtract 8 when you take it from 21 what do you get
12 when you take 8 from 21 what is your answer for 21 -8 i got 12
what good job
job okay when you cross multiply you cross multiply right you took 5 from 18 and you got 13 right then you cross multiplied 3 times 7 is what 21 and 8 times one is what 8 when you take 8 from 21 it s not 11
8 from 21 is not 11 thing i think one of the problem is we just like to take things so easy simple if you follow the steps there s no way you re going to miss it
left what is your final answer you have 13 over 24 proper proper so why do you have to divide 24 by 13
what yes right okay 13 over 24 why did you have to divide it
can 13 be divided by 3 okay so how did you get 4 what your answer should have been 13 and what what 24 that should have been your answer
here the whole numbers you what i subtracted the excuse me me this is individual practice one
me if you finish question one through 3 that i have there go to the assignment that you have that says question 62 and do all the questions that you have there keep on doing the questions for 62
62 you go over there and continue start from question one and continue if i get to you individually excuse me i don t think you understand individually that means you don t talk in the classroom
you are doing everything by yourself the time for we do redo is over now
know okay the question was 19 -414 right yes so you took 4 from 9
get 5 okay so what did you have for this 2 thirds and what when you cross multiply what did you get not okay you took 4 from 9 the 1st step is to subtract the whole numbers so you took 4 from 9 and what you have left you have to the what and what do you have left
2 thirds and what 14th and 14th so you are not supposed to what what multiply so when you cross multiplied to what is this what did you get
yes so why did you follow the step there i thought i put it
outside you see the lady that brought this she s right there can you tell her to come in and switch off the tape excuse me mind your business can you help me to collect the erasers erasers 1st
me mind your business
all right what did you say monday yes
get a book
yeah that s fine desk turn all the way around in your chair
you do need to follow directions that is not 3 equal parts
interesting excuse me nah no
put it back and finish your math it needs to be turned in if you re done and didn t i tell you to do your own work
that pull your seat in and do your own work this we have a test on this in another week you re not going to be able to take your pieces of paper with you
this is not your group have a seat
why is it you still don t have your stuff out from yesterday
remember we started out yesterday with finding what our unit was and how many equal parts made up our whole remember i compared it to the one where we had our pictures here we found out there were 14 little lines from the 0 to the one down we were finding sevenths
so we needed to know how to divide these 14 lines which are our wholes into 7 equal parts parts we knew that every 2nd line represented a 7 our question wanted us to find 4 sevenths so then we just counted to the next
does that sound familiar from yesterday yes then we continued to not having the unit we knew what the fraction was what that part was and we needed to find the whole
get out the probability paper on your desk then we found 5 fifths then we treated this part like the previous problems right where we used our denominator
we went from using just the denominator to half the whole and we wanted to know how to divide the whole into equal parts then we had the part that we had to divide into parts so we had to use the numerator that s telling us how many parts we have
all right so i want to go back and do a little review
this one here we have a part you do not have the unit and they want us to figure out what the x is so slightly different from where we started
12 so every 6 is going to be a 3rd right so one 2 3 4 5 6
6 this ends up being 3 thirds also as we know 18 eighteenths there s 20 lines on each bar
change now you have 18 eighteenths and we need to find out what x is
one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 i ll just put an 8 under there so we remember what number that has
what do let me think suddenly i lost my train of thought i lost my train of thought
0 i know when you are looking at bless you thank you
when you are looking at this okay when we are looking at this this wasn t as clear as i thought it was
i thought i had it figured out and then i went blank when we are trying to find x and obviously it does not line up on one of the black lines we have listed that we labeled we need to find kind of equivalent pieces
so if i look at just this section here i can divide this section right equally if i do that and i can continue that this way and have all the even pieces
too how many pieces does that give us with red
9 that bet comes a ninth on yes
divided i just looked at the section the x was in and that i can divide into 3 equal parts and then divide it all the way out to where i had the one to find my fraction here does everybody have this
that this one is 2 fifths so we know there s a 15th in here somewhere
in here this is 345 fifths so we have one 2 3 4 5 this is 6 lines to here right since it is a part of a part or dividing it by a 2 the numerator 3 times 2 is 6
so every 3rd again one 2 3 one 2 3 one 2 3 one 2 3 4 one 2 3 this one here comes up 5 fifths everybody does see where we re getting that right
yes that part is pretty basic
then we need to figure out what the x is how else could we divide and figure out what that fraction would be still ending up with a whole
is any ideas yes
one you can t divide it in half because you have an odd number so that makes all of these we just end up with a different kind of fraction
i don t know if that s what we could have done even better if you already have this done do that in a different color thinking we know 15 is divisible by 5 here i also know that 15 can be divided by 3 or divisible by 3
what s 15 divided by 3 5 that didn t work
green you could have divided it into 3s but the option you had to do the 1st time is figuring out how to divide one part and doing the same thing across all of that
your only option is the 13 fifteenths option all right fraction we talked about what kind it was yesterday yes
it s an improper fraction which means it s gone beyond a whole we had 4 fourths last one and what do you add to 4 to get to 9 5 so we have 4 fourths plus another 5 fourths to get to 9 fourths
i ll wait for you to finish talking i m glad you understand this so perfectly that you don t have to bother listening how many we know this is our line 18 right
lines somebody has to count them all we re still dealing with parts of fractions it s not 2 right so we re still going to deal with our parts
2 so every 2 then one 2 one 2 one 2 right so this here is 14th
we have our improper fractions and our mixed numbers so you can see that i was not kidding i know i probably should have done the 5 fourths 6 fourths across the top then do the mixed numbers across the bottom our one is here right our one is on what
8 i ll put that there so we can add it we have this which is better all by itself the only way to divide that is to divide every line
remember 18th picture this as being your bar we start with our fourths and then if we wanted eighths we divided everything in half 18th 2 eighths 3 eighths 4 eighths right 2 fourths 5 tenths those are all equal to half right
this one is 5 eighths 6 eighths 7 eighths then our fractions are working 3 eighths it does indeed come between 14th and 2 fourths halfway between to be exact
remember our focus is always the whole and this time all you re having to do is figure out how to divide the bars as opposed to them telling you how it s divided r is that 4 eighths under 2 fourths yes
my 8 got a little sideways
other than using this to find our whole you didn t need to be concerned with anything else at this stage here down yes no
me i don t want to hear from anybody that has a no i ll wait
if you are able to while i wait for people to copy this find the whole you can go ahead and start
away as a matter of fact put the glue on my table and whatever you were gluing throw it away put the glue on my table you don t have to wipe off the lid close the lid
away don t make me come back there and get it
okay i ll put it back if you re not done copying back so how did we get to those of you that were working on this how did we get to 5 sixths what is the 1st thing you had to start with
yes to get to 5 sixths how many lines is that talking those of you that came in you need to just listen i told you i would put it back up later
10 since we re working with parts of fractions we re using just the numerator at this and remember i told you yesterday i m not going to give you stuff that s not going to match you wouldn t have 4 sixths and then end up with 10 right so that s always a good indication when you re counting
say you have 11 and you re counting by 5 you re not going to have a fraction of a fraction all right so what s 10 divided by 5
2 so every 2 all right that s 5 sixths we need to get to 6 sixths so we know where our unit is it doesn t ask for it but you know where our unit is
so how should we divide it to find out what fraction the x is lines there s only one way i can divide it and how is that guess we just divide this one section
is this making a little bit of sense
not made the last 3 and i must have miscounted figures yeah
this one i want to make it a put the 12 where it belongs remember i told you it wouldn t make it
one hopefully you can solve it with the x going the wrong way okay so what s 12 divided by 3
3 so every 4th one 2 3 4 this is my 4 fourths or a whole
works is there any easy way to divide that x
chair i asked you to stop away divide everything in half 2 so when does that have its 2 4 6 8 10 12
it s not 3 sixteenths i counted the wrong one you all need to be paying attention so i m not sixteenths is what we would have had if we left the x where it was
with sixteenths is 2 times 8 the green is 8 eighths i counted the wrong lines
8 we divided it into halfway between fourths is eighths see that
that one i thought when i stood back here that all right last one we have 13rd
up put that sheet away how many lines are between 0 and 13rd yes 6 since this is 13rd we don t have to do any division because that s 6 divided by one which is 6
6 we re on line 18 just in case you care later in here a slightly different one 2 one 2 one 2
i can divide our sixteenths or our thirds i should say into 3 equal parts right based on where my box is mean i put one between each one so it s every 2
2 this was 3 thirds
then we have one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 99 ninths one 2 34 ninths just remember when we ve done this before parts 3 times 3 is 9
ninths just took a little playing
fit all right while we are you put the math and copy down these 1st couple it s very simple
seat none of this is any of your concern
have a seat you moved your bag
what did i say you were supposed to do if you happened to be done with your math
later when you have written the date at the top of the page don t close the book
put your pencil in it and then close it so you can find your place easily then come to the floor i need everybody so you can all see me and i can see you except for the people that are going to stay
i want you to move up here so you can be closer no you re going to move there so you can see what we re doing you re going to move away from the table okay here actually there are some magnets geometric shapes but we re not using them on the whiteboard right now
i m going to pass them around and what i want you to do is each of you take a shape take one shape up it doesn t matter what color doesn t matter what shape so take one and pass them over
one keep it passing you should pass that back to then we can get one side of the room and then the other
when you get your shape i want you to look at it and think about it but don t say anything think about if you were to have to write about that shape what you would say about it but don t say anything out loud
head when everybody has a shape we can just put the buckets over here
look deep into your shape look at it from all sides
yes these aren t really strong magnets we re not going to be sticking it to anything so that s okay shape raise your hand if you don t have one yet good let s put the boxes up there on the desk beside
okay we ve got one 2 3 4 5 tables in here correct
yes everybody knows that s table number 12345 okay i want you to stand up with your shape and i want you to go over there and sit down at that chair that s farthest away from me but facing me at table number one
yeah then hold up your shape but don t say a word okay everybody turn your head and look at up i want you to look at the shape that you are holding and i want you to decide if you should go over there and sit at the table with or if you should go to table 2
keep your fingers off my shapes there hold up your shape so you can see this is a thinking activity not speaking just thinking you see what has and did not feel that he belonged with so he went to table 2
look at your shape if you feel like you belong with go sit at that table if you feel like you belong with go sit at that table but if you feel like you belong at a different table go sit by yourself remember this is all about your shape you ve got to keep holding it up so you can see it
up stand up up if you decide you should be with them go there if you think you should go with him go there
if you think you should be at a table by yourself please go to table 3 when you go to a table keep holding your shape up thinking stand up
thing you think you belong with them go there here if you think you should be at a table by yourself go here right if you think you have something in common with them you know somebody go to their table
if you have something new go to table number 4 okay z okay
up hold your shape up so everybody can see what you added to the group
b okay what do you have m okay
is there anybody that thinks we have 4 groups going here is there anybody that thinks that they should start a new group anybody believes they should be at table 5 does everybody think they kind of know where they belong right now
yes quietly move to where you believe you belong okay go back further okay do not bring the chairs
stand i need your attention in 5 4 look at me 3 2 one
in a soft soft voice and i mean softer than the voice i m talking in i m going to give you one minute to talk to the people in your group about why you belong together look at your shapes and not ready yet
shapes think about everything that those shapes have in common that you can talk to your people in your group about softly
okay you re going to have a chance to talk to each other again in a minute i m going to point to each group and i want you to tell me what the 1st thing is your group noticed that you have in common
group number 4 okay we all have parallelograms we re having trouble listening
they said something profound i didn t expect to hear this from the 1st group would you repeat it please we have 2 pairs of parallel lines what do you mean by that
because 2 of the sides are equal and the same sides on 2 sides and these 2 are the same sides same size as the rectangle okay i hope you heard what he said over there because i m coming to you too
you used a word some people may not be familiar with mean talk louder so i can hear you
2 sides or lines are the same the parallel equal size thumbs up if you agree that parallel means equal sides thumbs down if you think there s something else to it
can you help can anybody explain parallel word
there are 2 lines that go like not together but one is on top like that like this yes e she says the parallel is like this so what else could you say about parallel
crossing if they cross intersect okay so one thing that they noticed this group noticed about this shape they said they had 2 pairs of parallel lines hold that thought because there may be more
this group does your shape have 2 sets of parallel lines
what is one thing you noticed about your shape they have kind of like parallel sides but they re so they did intersect each other
add if you put them together okay let me see those for a minute shape so actually put 2 of her shapes together and then it did look very similar to your shape
how many sides did each of everybody have a 3 sided shape here word table number 2 what s something your shapes had in common 90 degree angles just a minute
let s wait until everybody s listening said i said that they had 90 degree angles in their shapes what is a 90 degree angle what like when you have an angle it s straight and it can fit another shape inside it
square i hope you heard what he was saying over here i am rather amazed you didn t have anything to measure that angle with and you can just look at it and tell it was a 90 degree angle
he said it was like the corner of a piece of paper a brick a post it note this group what did you notice about your shape that brought you together
a that they all have 6 sides and it s a hexagon and it s 180 degrees they all have 6 sides and they re hexagons and those are 80 degrees and obtuse open angles backup let me see
minute she said that she had all of the angles were more than 90 degrees
people at i only have 2 people at table number 5 you and why did you go off over there by yourself turn your eyes so you re looking at them
shapes this table i believe you said you had 2 pairs of parallel lines does their shape have 2 pairs of parallel lines 11 this group you said that we don t have everybody s attention
sit this group said that yours had 3 sides and they would intersect can you say that about hers or his parallel these 2 if they continued would intersect
sides this group you said that 4 right angles right no obtuse angles do they have any right angles
no okay table number one here i am yeah baby you said that your shapes all had 6 sides
no okay so you did a very good i m having to stop more than i d like you re doing a very good job of grouping yourself yourself you re standing
marker i want you to write really big and go back to your own seat take your shape with you and open your math journal to that page
okay that s very good thinking okay write this nice and big on the board
it b u you okay
attributes we use the word attributes in language arts and science and social studies and we use it in math so can you give me some synonyms for attributes or explain to me what an attribute is
okay if we were talking about language arts we would say character traits characteristics would you go back up there and write characteristics underneath that
m all right waiting you said some great things put the word describe
yes i want you to write this in your journal i want you to stop talking to the people at your table and get this written down characteristics if we were talking about people we would say character traits
d e attributes are characteristics that describe think about your own sentence using those 3 words you can use my sentence or you can write it the way that you would like to say it to write a word for attributes everybody right now
don t put character traits up there because we re talking about shapes today not people that okay
attributes are characteristics used to describe a shape it attribute means to describe the characteristics of shapes
okay attributes are characteristics that describe some forms or shapes that i thought of a synonym for shape i d like to add to the board
sometimes we hear shapes called figures figures okay right so everybody should have a sentence do you have a sentence written down you have the words but you don t have the sentence i want you to think again are you going somewhere
i want you to think what attributes we considered when you were grouping yourselves what were the characteristics of the shapes we were looking at j they were different kinds of shapes but what characteristics did we observe
they were like the same shapes or same sizes or polygons go write size on the board then everybody add size please skip a line and we re going to list some attributes now that we thought about when we were grouping there you looked at the whole shape
that board angles we did we did
d we looked for the parallelograms parallel sides go write that down okay what would you like to add i d like to add what your temperature was
no like how much the angle was you looked at the measure of the angles board but we were yes we had a conversation about the size of the angles or the measurement of the angles
okay anything else to form if you add 2 of the same shapes it could cause another shape so we looked at how we could put some together to make some shapes together to make other shapes
did okay degrees beside size of angles why don t you write degrees so we know you re not talking about temperature
everybody be sure you get this list down because these are the attributes we use and these are the attributes you re going to use when you re grouping other angles
me let me get back here if i can find it me okay you want me to write them bigger okay i will 0 you have some prior knowledge of this don t you
okay all right i m going to write some of these words bigger size we looked at the whole shape it you looked at not the angels but the angles everybody gets that mixed up
we looked you know there s something wonderful about the word parallel ls they re parallel that will what was that word you used
mean all right so parallel size of angles and we used the word degrees okay you also i heard you say right angle
i heard obtuse acute thank you you re welcome we ll just splash these words up here use there s another word kind of a synonym for equivalent going quadrilateral if it s the same size and same shape congruent
okay so when you are grouping you could perhaps use equivalent equilateral congruent vocabulary not everybody may know what a vertex is
so okay okay would you come here please and would you hold this for me
vertex she s going to tell you so where s the corner okay now how would what makes that a corner
corner meet now this is something that i always have to stop and think about you are we dealing with lines here or line segments okay i need to hear ms
c what is the definition of a line it it s a broken piece of a shape is a line a broken piece of a shape no there s something very special about a line
what were you going to say be you need to listen to each other a line could be straight or curved we re talking about straight lines here because we re working with polygons
a line keeps on going to infinity keeps on going like numbers in both directions right now if we all talk at once it s just noise
you said something about a broken piece of a shape line we call it a line segment do these sides go on and on and on forever
no so this triangle is made up of 3 line segments rays this shape uses rays
rays we are really getting into it now so i m going to give you this piece of paper the shape we worked with before were really simple shapes and i see some of those shapes on this piece of paper but i also see a lot of different shapes that we re not used to looking at
so i m going to give well i m about to tell you as soon as i have everybody s attention i m going to give each of you a sheet of paper and it has 25 shapes on it okay do you know how we were doing make words this morning
we were sorting our words thinking of categories and sorting our words okay when you just a few minutes ago we did this activity with the shapes yourself you went where you thought you belonged the shapes are numbered one 25 you can use the bottom of the page or or you can also turn over on the back of the page
i want you to take about 5 or 10 minutes on your own before we work together as a group to try to make some groupings out of these shapes
about you might group them by looking at the whole shape by looking at the sides the angles looking to see if any of the lines are parallel or right angles or obtuse angles or acute angles
whatever attribute you decide to use see how you can group the shapes so you have shapes that go together question they do some of them look how would you describe colorado
shape it looks a lot like a square or perhaps a rectangle it now we re not going to cut them apart so what could you do to group them g write down a number you can maybe draw a circle and write down the numbers inside the circle and make columns
to all right i want you to work on your own for a while before you work with your group please write your name okay here you go

sometimes sometimes it keeps going here you go
so can you tell me what you drew there i drew a square and so you drew a triangle here and put a square in that angle of the triangle so what would you say about that
good thinking now look at these and see what you can do with that raise your hand if okay let s say if you can tell me if you re supposed to be working with a friend or alone right now alone so i won t be hearing you if you re working alone
you just a minute 5 or 10 minutes you re looking for ways you can group those angles
one is there anything else that has something in common with number one that you can put in a group with it how many sides does number one have what kind of angles does number one have acute are they
yes are there any other shapes that have 4 sides and 4 right angles look take an attribute and look and see how many shapes have that in common
just a minute what can a shape go in more than one category asked a great question he said can a shape go in more than one category yes so think about it
possible so you need to open up your mind and think flexibly because a shape could sometimes go in more than one category those are no those 2 line segments they do not have to be congruent to be parallel
those 2 line segments are different lengths but they are parallel put it up here okay
well if you took the corner of this piece of paper and put it in that angle would the angle be greater than or less than 90 degrees less so is it obtuse yes
okay you put one 2 and 3 together because they were all quadrilaterals okay
i ll be there in a 2nd okay now you re going to have to look all over your paper to find them so somewhere could you have a place you could list the numbers with all the ones that keep working until i get there
them how many sides angles so do all hexagons look alike do all pentagons look alike sides you wrote all of this stuff so get some good categories down here
shapes use the word quadrilateral because you know it i noticed something what did you notice that every one of them wait a minute this conversation is not about geometry
geometry that every one of them every line meets except the circle because the circle has no angles at all because it s round and the more sides you have on some of them the more chances you have to have a circle or curved line
because a circle as no sides and goes all the way around doing 180 degrees actually more than that circle okay every one of them what s the definition of polygon
a polygon that s what is does a circle have sides no
these are closed and every one of the lines even if it is a different shape all the lines intersect all the lines you see intersect in the line segment okay yes if they were lines and they continued on they would be a line segment you said something very amazing a minute ago
the more sides a shape has the closer it is to a circle thinking okay own you ve had some time to work on your own
so you have some grouping on your paper i want you to take the next let s see one 2 3 4 minutes until 12 40 to talk with the people in your group and see if you came up with the same groupings or some different ones okay let s see
and you can go to the back table and compare yours them okay
why did you group 4 and 8 together okay that works
okay how did you group yours i like this one that he made a category out of all of the shapes that have right angles
he also has octagons has hexagons and also just looking at shapes that have one obtuse angle lots of ways to do it
okay all right
floor i asked you to bring your paper with you please okay all right we need to be at the floor in 10 9 you re embarrassing yourself is this your paper
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and one
okay what s one way that you grouped shapes corners what do you mean by that so you said that number 4 had this is where we really need to listen to each other
okay says that number 4 has an extremely acute angle now would you hand me a post it note off my desk
find here let me get it 2 your attention needs to be on the board
right and i were both wondering if perhaps in addition to having that very acute angle that it might have a right angle so i m going to take this paper and slip it into that okay now i have to line up excuse me
i have to line up one side of my shape with the piece of paper is this angle more or less than 90 degrees less i thought the same thing you did when i 1st looked at it what other shape did you group with this
all of the triangles because you saw acute angles in all of the triangles see does 17 have an acute angle yes yes okay
okay come on point s criteria was that it had was your criteria that it had to have all acute angles or just an acute angle
angle so would 22 fit that criteria yes now if your criteria if you re looking for all acute angles would 22 fit that no no it wouldn t so put listen to the word all
he put all of the triangles into this category because all of the triangles had at least one acute angle did anybody group number 19 okay what on earth did you come up with for an attribute for number 19
i can t hear him working what did you use here what attribute
an obtuse right and an acute angle you said you saw all 3 types of angles there okay okay
try this to see if that is in fact a right angle
okay wait a minute okay okay just a minute there is something really important going on up here talking okay
please look i want to hear all of you you all step back so they can all look everybody look carefully at this angle
okay if you move it this way it doesn t line up on the bottom and if you move it that way it s very close isn t it see okay is that a right angle okay
so if you sometimes it will appear to be a right angle but you really can t tell for sure unless you measure it tonight you ve got these same shapes here
there it s got to be exactly do you see that little sliver it s very close that s an 89 degree angle if we got a protractor and measured it do you did this very quickly at your groups
i want you to take this paper home tonight and with your parents i want you to come up with 5 ways that you can group these shapes have 5 how many ways do i want you to come up with 5
okay so okay so i want you to take this home with your math journal and come up with 5 ways 5 different attributes and group those shapes what we have like 50 of them
sit down waiting for everybody to get in their seats can remind me after specials i ll give you a protractor looking for the table i m going to dismiss 1st is writing your homework down
your instructions were to go back to your seat and write your math assignment down
down yes ma am why don t you get a piece of paper and when we come back from specials i ll leave it up and you can come up here
all right ms l people may line up at the door me all right
put that paper inside of your math journal and we re going to go to pe today
speak up sometimes say what you need to speak up sometimes yeah i have the answers so i m going to check em right here try you got to try sometimes and i know that you try and that you try on the test i don t want the 1st time to be your test i don t speak up i just keep my answers to myself you re speaking up now
still waiting 1st i m looking for a group that s you are by yourself but i still have a few that are not quite ready d you need to hang your book bag up
track get rid of the gum still waiting here for that group back there waiting waiting hang the book bags
who could tell me what we went over yesterday so we can prepare for the sols division what was the important part i was trying to get everybody to do yesterday something i needed to see something you needed to see so that it show we get the right answer write your answer out the steps writing your answers out
way something in particular i kept saying i need to see k the steps steps show the step for what type of math for division division okay i m going to put these letters on the board and you re going to tell me what they stand for
you how d you know she spelled that thank you good good all right what is it for division multiplication subtraction and verification all right you know what i saw yesterday this 2 go into 28 28 and somebody automatically said 0 i got it
up they just like that but was that a wrong answer see the steps the steps i need to actually see how you got the one there one times 2 is 2 i need to see the subtraction i need to see the bring down 4 and the 4 and the 8 exactly so i had some people doing that and they would get through their work real fast but then they were coming up
it 0 you got to a 0 and said i don t understand so today what i m going to do is i m going to take it up a notch i m going to divide us into 3 groups i m going to have one group that group that just was flying through the ones that had the answers me 0 i have some bigger problems for you so you got to do the steps i can one thing i ll wait
wait don t be scared one thing i m happy about is that those people that we re doing it and they were putting the answers up there and they got em right they were doing the math in their head and that s a good thing good and even with these problems that i got that are pretty long you re going to go 0 man all those numbers example be quiet and let s put your hand up if you get an answer
i don t have something can i put the problem up 1st ooh yes ah that don t want to hear anything i just want you to look at it
it i m looking at a 4 digit dividend a 4 digit dividend some of you as soon as you see it 0 i can t get that but then i m thinking if you stop for a minute think in your mind you already got the answer you haven t done not one step but you ve already gotten the answer i m going to give a few people another moment
see ooh i doing my 1st place okay i think i got it it now i m looking for a quiet let me see again okay i got it i needed i had to double check myself cause i did it all in my mind i didn t use one sheet of paper but i m looking for a quiet hand with the answer
for are you with me today dag i wish he huh i think it s wrong i think you said well tell me what you think the answer might be on starting out with 6 i don t that s a little scary all right tell me what you think it is
316 that s what i whoa anybody else got something different 366 366 hold on to that 31 31 boy if you take it another step in your mind you d be there what do you got 31 remainder 4
got 300 and 300 and something 300 well you know what me nope i don t 32 not bad 316 300 that s 2 316s
316 and one more 304 now what can i do to figure it out steps good and some people took a minute and said hey i got this and did it in their brain
brain but what i want to ensure is that when you take that sol that you could sit there and do what they were telling us in the meeting this morning that they wanted names on your scratch papers because in case you don t mark the answer in your book they can always look back at your scratch paper and see that you actually did the work do i want you to just take the test put the answer up there just cause you see it in your mind
work show your work all right you want to come up here and show you got the right answer you the 1st one with the correct answer do yeah you didn t give me the right answer but i know how to do it it you said i was wrong no i didn t i said wow i didn t say you was wrong do it man go try come on man be i got you
you all right thank you like pulling teeth come on i m not going to let you fail you re going to look good on i like the the 1st thing he said could 6 go into what 18 wait you hear did see your eyes and your mouth closed 1st big 6 go into one
no so you say 6 go into what 86 go into what say 3 shh 33 put your 3 right there over the top of the 8 what sign you going to put here
6 i love the way he s counting that s right i love that do you have 18 18 very good put your 18 right up under that 18
step you divided you multiplied what do you do now do sssub subtract subtract there you go
on draw your line 01 from one is 08 from 8 is what 0 good what number did he bring down really
steps bring it down put your arrow and show me that you bring it down and put the 91 nope 0
hold up 9 fingers how many 6s do you have how many 6 did you get out of 9 sweetie somebody help him out here one times 6 is
steps draw your line and subtract hold up 9 fingers take away 6 how many you got left 3 draw your line 9 take away 63 i see a long arrow come here cause we got to bring down that and how many times does 6 put your 6 here what s your new dividend 36
6 go into 36 how many times what times 6 will give you 366 why you say it
0 yeah didn t i say 6 put your 6 there remainder draw your line and subtract 36 from 36 gives you what
0 it was wrong i know it s 00 3 from 3 is 0 and 6 from 6 is 0 do you have a remainder hand all right let s see one more before we i can t take me teacher d
see what i recognize is a quiet hand notch i feel like messing with people today because i know you could do the math but i m worried about the steps
huh ooh look look look at it
it 0 teacher s in competition woo woo teacher d i know it pretend i don t know we ll see none of you ladies back here one out of 3 that s not good come on now
i see too much paper and pencil and asked you to do it in your mind i know sshh 0 i know let me see it don t tell him don t tell him don t tell him okay i got it s 500 and i got it
yeah i wasn t getting it 510 who says you re just yelling out which i really don t like i like the way that you re thinking tell me what you re thinking 541 500 what 41 j i didn t tell him
r i had it written some way what do you got 5411 same thing go up there and this time i m going to leave you by yourself okay hand come on go for it
matter of fact let me go ahead and give you what i supposed to give you now before i get upset cause you just don t get it at all 0 my god go for it you cracked the do your thing do your thing up this is one be quiet 0 i like the way he s thinking over there
that s okay he s got the other i got to stop now 0 you back after you stopped omg come on man
dividend this is why i m this is why we re going over you guys can do it but then you get stuck in your steps point to your new dividend
sir and 5 times 4 is good by 5 no what do you have to do before you bring down away and what do you bring down my 5 i want to put it right here huh
and what is your new dividend 55 and what do you ask yourself how many times 5 go in 5 how many go excellent what do you say 5 take away 55 times 4 times 11 is
5 but that s doing it over excellent 541 take away i mean remainder 0 do give me one minute give me one minute good job
do i need to do one more but this time i want it totally quiet because sometimes people are hearing and that s how they giving the answer i m expecting my answer to come from somewhere in that area so turn the brain on back there because you re sitting there i know but i want to mess with you today
it i ll mess with a couple of people so it s quiet ha let me see
what okay can i do a easy one teacher d what s the number 19 yeah that ll work that was a good year 1989
1989 ah i m waiting for a quiet hand is what i m looking for okay
for i think i ve had 2 boys to the board i don t want you telling me what anybody else want to do teacher d i know it d i know it wow i want to call you but you going to go up there and fly through it you promise me you will go up there and you will take your time
me all right let s see tell me what you thinking what are you thinking well what the answer is 221 all right let me look at it go okay
221 teacher d it s 281 remainder 8 80 man so close 220 woo 220 remainder of 3
thinking you don t know too you re going to try today another one too do you got any thoughts i got 221 221 come on please quickly teacher d can i go up
it it s the ones that aren t calling me that i am calling we didn t figure that out yet see she always tell me why you put the 2 there because 2 goes into 19 2 times cause 2 goes into 19 2 times whoa whoa tell me why did you put the 2 there 2 goes into 19 2 goes into 19 2 times you say it one more time cause you re not saying it the right way
2 times 9 equals 18
do if you are with teacher a you are at the back table i have some gentlemen over here and what i m going to do is i m going to give you your clear communicator go up on my desk table can i pass out can you pass out the erasers clap once do you hear me
yes clap once clap twice we re still talking do anybody still hear a voice yes
still waiting if you work with teacher a go to the back table group 3 i want you over here
okay we re going to do it good can i have the okay she didn t give me you said okay this is for your group
get over there with them you stay right here talking we re still talking that s amazing teacher d i need a do you want me right here or do you want to sit here
you can group 3 come over here so you have space no i like being whatever he s going to have a harder sheet
i thought you would see it my way what did you say to do with this you want to work
i didn t do that i did i m supposed to have all long division correct 0 no you re not supposed to have that yeah
up where are the other papers here this teacher d i made a mistake i was hoping that you could work with group 3 today because you got this i would hope that i want your paper to be my key why it so cold in here i m good i m not cold 0 gotcha come over here with me
i need a marker teacher d it you should have a or excuse me pull up another chair please i don t get it
10 piece of paper right there here put it in here i ll just wait i was sitting on she is going to get some help
and then when i see that you got it i want you to move back into the classroom because it doesn t take a rocket scientist huh okay
yes all right guys the test is in less than 8 days so now is the time for you to get the information it write the 1st problem down you have your clear communicator in front of you
where s yours i don t got one and this is the person who teacher d look in that plastic container and get the communicator she s at the can i do this sure there ain t no more in here there s no more in there did i have any empty communicators
this here you go and you know you need one too i said thank you you got 3 times that i can always all right let s get the 1st problem down on your board please it i don t let s go
352 i got an answer good but you wasn t in the answer so far but you re putting you re putting numbers up there steps 0 yes okay why are you doing this
cause you should be working over there with teacher s you have this math but you wanted to act like you don t come on and get over here in this group nothing you don t need help didn t you get an a on your report card in math and you re sitting here like you don t get it and you got it
d i want to do it by myself okay you could do it by yourself but why can t you do the big problems that s fine what do you do ask how many times does 3 go into 3 how many 3 times really no one i m sorry what does that mean what do you do
exactly good bring down excellent yes so hold up 5 fingers how many times 3 get in there 12321 i mean one times 3 ah ah one times 3 is 11 times 3 is 33 from 5 hold up 5 fingers
35 take away 322 bring that all the way down what s your new dividend say 2 plus now where are your timetable charts
i got one where are yours let s get it it because the 1st thing you do when you get your test is i want you to make your very own timetable charts just like the ones we made in class it s going to take a long time no it s not would you rather it take a long time and get the right answers or a short time and get the wrong answers i don t know i still don t see your steps
teacher d this is what i had at 1st 13 subtract bring down one number yes no 0 right here yes yes i got mine no that 2 goes beside the other 2
no no your arrow is too long this yes yea why isn t it underneath the line do this huh comes to 35
35 teacher d like this 0 22 we re asking ourselves how many times does 3 go into 22
7 don t sit there running your mouth i got it s all right here okay
77 is correct one more down at the bottom you have it but you keep getting stuck yes ma am that s it it should you don t even have the right answer show me your work
it i like the way is writing her answer on the paper but i did mine i can t write the answers on this well teacher d just did it you can write on the paper 0
one you see what i m saying we re getting ready to i didn t have yeah i know so let s go to the next one where i can make sure you got it 857 you do it teacher d you write gentlemen over there i need to see you work
i wouldn t know i haven t worked it out yet i just need you all to i need to see your steps it can t so we say how many times does 9 go into 85 use the there you go
what if you don t got and how could not look at the 9s 9 times 8 it go in 45 times you still you re sitting there with the wrong answer again
no steps all answer the next time you do em i asked you to just move because you re not trying the whole you can t even make it to the 5th grade without being able to do this where s your timetable charts i think it s in my desk i don t well you want to get it nah i m going to teacher d it s 9 teacher d it s 9 yes
is it s 99 is correct yeah no the 9 doesn t go over the 8 where does the 9 go it goes with the 5 it goes with the 5 because we re saying 9 and 85 is what 9 times 9 81
40 somebody tore it up too didn t they x okay all right no let s look at how many times can 9 go into 47 without going over 9 and 47
81 do the math bring down show me teacher d and bring down the 7 you re closer teacher d now bring down the 7 yes no 27 and you passed the line put our names on so your new dividend is 47 right
now 0 it s 55 is correct 5 up top before had the wrong number you re right you did say it made it too wait a minute what s 9 times 59 45 on subtract it s 2 yeah it s reminder 2 and what s 9 times 5 you need to put it
27 no it wasn t 275 can go into 60 no big deal good put the answer on your paper it s 3 so i don t get it
no so your remainder is what else if you write your numbers neater you wouldn t have all that 0 thank you 692 divided by 5 692 divided by 5
5 i m going to write an angle with this 692 divided by 50 what was the answer 95 remainder 2 how are you guys doing over there remainder 2
4 come on steps but they re doing the same problem doing this one no they re doing something else yeah that s the same problem no they re doing something else
right can i go over and see it looks like it but it s something else okay i know hold up 6 fingers can we get 5 into there yeah yeah no hold up 6 fingers hold up 6 fingers can you get 5 in there huh how many times one thank you and that s 5 teacher d i got it
okay good keep going do you see what i m saying you got it but you want to say like you don t have it 9 only bring down one number at a time
15 how did you get that you put 15 there so fast with no number up there you working it i need to see the number up there sweetie no i m working on huh no one s got the so how many times does 5 go into 19 that s your new dividend 433 is correct 3 times 5 is
that s what i okay right there one it s 33 is it what s what huh down is this the one here s the 1st one 5 into 42 on it s 8 i know 8 from 82
42 come on now as you re looking at it and you know how to do it what are you looking at it for is 88 woohoo can you help me
you so we re not allowed to do it on that wait a minute yes 7 into 264 138 132 remainder 130 8 thank you you didn t get no more answers i need to see your work
huh i don t know all boys clear no you do it because because i need help no how many times does 2 go into 71 no erase all of it except the problem i mean 2 goes into 73 times i need to see it
yet times 7 25 is in it s 3 times 264 divided by 7 and we asked our self how many times does 7 go into 26 what 9 times 3 times 7 is
is from what 21 take away from 2655 is 5 what number do we bring down 4 i need to see it i did that no you didn t you just wrote it 85 yes how many times does 7 go into 546 why are you taking that 0 no no no
that that s the actual lines 77 is correct 7 times 7 is 49 no what is it no so we borrow 0 that 4 9 from 4
hold up 4 fingers no you can t at 1st you said no 14 it s 55 is correct 5 is correct that s 5 and that is our remainder
37 i ain t doing all right let s clear the boards we have 0 more you want to stay okay
673 where you at up i want each of you guys to do one more before we try to wrap it we re going to keep working on this but we re going to bring the tape to a close
teacher d probably go to the has already said 2 goes into 6 how many times 201 really 2 stop guess 2 really 3 i mean it s 33 times 2 is
66 from 6 brings what 0 what number do we bring down 77 hold up 7 fingers and figure it out what how many 2s sets of 2s you got here 31233 times 2 is
3 times 2 is is 66 from 766 hold up i mean hold up 7 fingers 61 it s one
one wrong finger i put the wrong finger up 13 so ah ah i m just putting that there how many times does 2 go into 13
12 12 is there take away it very good moment we are going to continue to work with this me tell me something that you see that s helping you do better with your division
tell me something that you re doing that s helping you to do a better job with your division i need to see a hand please you the steps she s working the steps success what about you guys that are doing bigger problems with larger dividends worser i got it easy math is worse it s worse
why i don t know what do you see yourself doing more of
action we ve haven t had fraction action since probably about a month now all right what have you learned about what someone tell me something you ve learned about fractions that makes it different than whole numbers
completely different yes groups and whole numbers they re just one whole divided into groups it all fractions are between one and 0 fantastic i was just about to ask if anyone remembered that
one fractions and decimals as we re going to get to later in the year and more towards 5th grade fractions all right we talked about adding them and subtracting them and that has been tricky why has that been tricky and why does that really make us think n because the number the bottom number which is the
denominator they re 2 different numbers right when they re not the same that is causing us problems and that is when we have to find the common denominator when they are the same we got pretty good at that where you would just multiply the numerator and not the denominator right okay so we re going to talk about multiplying fractions
i actually really like multiplying fractions because well i think it s a little easier okay the algorithm is the pencil and paper way that you know can be a little boring sometimes but we re also going to explore ways to do it visually and to draw pictures and represent things okay
here all right what are you what have you decided about this that it s easier easier okay all right so multiply n times n and d times d for numerator and denominator all right and that s what you do when you multiply fractions
6 that seems almost a little too easy at times now it will get more difficult but that s a pretty basic example all right so if you know you re what do i always say times if you know your times tables inside and out backwards and forwards it will be a lot easier
yes are you going to teach us how to do like how to do multiply a mixed number by a mixed number 0 yes
different it s different because this time you do . the . on . the denominator yeah this time you get to add them well which one the . all right you said add or multiply what do you mean multiply multiply okay so you don t have to stop and think what the numbers have in common
sometimes you know 5 and 15 or 3 and 9 you know you just have to know your times tables and multiply all right well now that you know that think about this okay all right what does this model represent to you
it you re going to see kind of like when we do inferences versus facts what do you see that is really hear in front of you a going up there s 3 sixths and then like going up please thank you
okay going up or what s a better mathematical term vertical vertical yes okay 3 sixths 3 like little triangles they intersect on with the last okay one in the corner all right good you re on to something good all right and i wanted to for me i m calling these waves and mountains okay blue and green waves and for some reason i decided to make purple mountains
why all right waves and mountains because that ties science too so i m going to get you thinking about science as well all right the waves represent something and the mountains represent something and then where the waves and the mountains come together that represents something eyes on me please thinking i need you all thinking
i think the mountains are whole and the like the wavy lines are one half you re right about part of it the wavy lines do represent one half but do you think the mountains are you sure the mountains represent one whole 0 the whole is the entire grid okay
grid do you want to try again the mountains represent 13rd okay what do the mountains and the ocean when they come together represent over the waves application okay you re onto something yes rain okay teacher e would love that
s a 3rd 2 thirds okay i m glad you re thinking 4 sixths 4 sixths okay all right no one has seen it yet grid 6 okay how many are how many actually show just waves
mountains 22 of the 6 but we learned in equivalent fractions that 2 sixths is the same as 13rd represent 116th 3 and one half and one half and 13rd okay this is the model
this this model shows the algorithm doesn t it it shows 13rd times one half right 013rd times one half you have to look at the whole picture 000 wow that s the that s the one that was weird okay so you have to look at the whole picture
later before we get to that point i want you to do more thinking because i you know this is the 1st time you ve probably seen a model like this this before we do that one i want to do a little more thinking all right so you re going to go back to your seats and work in your groups
moment and you re going to take the brownie challenge time to think arts i ll need you to turn around please all right so this is getting your brain thinking about fractions thinking about maybe multiplying them and even dividing them in the future
happy so don t eat the paper brownies
b the brownie challenge how do we split wait number one how do we split 3 brownies equally for 4 people how do we split 4 brownies equally for 3 people okay so you re going to that is going to be a challenge at your desk
to go back with your partner this is the same person you ve been making your solar systems models with and you re going to try and think great you re going to have to talk with your now on one of your pieces of paper you re going to draw 3 big circles representing 3 plates right on your other big one you re going to draw 4 big circles representing 4 plates and then you re going to glue down the brownies to show each person has an exact amount
you cannot blue them down until each until you have figured out a way to split these up exactly and that s where you need to think and discuss okay okay right if you re to avoid a lot of commotion and knocking the camera over if you re a girl stand up and go to where you ve been sitting
yes ah said 4 fourths excuse me
already if you figured it out you re not going to be too loud and yell it out because you re going to want the other groups to think about it as well now put it under because that is going to be to make models later once you ve solved the brownie challenge
so i would work with my group by . i don t care if your plates are perfectly round as a matter of fact you can make your plates any shape you want can we do the brownie challenge then the can we do the brownie challenge then the the brownie challenge comes 1st
you are not to do models until you figure out the brownie challenge models and this is for the brownie challenge okay erase doesn t eraser feel like it does but what does that have to do with the brownie challenge you might have more than 10 brownies
okay i only got one you re only really going to need 7 brownies why 3 plates 4 you re going to split 3 or you re going to split 4 i m not giving you any instructions that and yelling that out
own that s something you need to discuss with your partner to see if that will work for splitting them equally the 1st thing i would do is start spreading them out and seeing what can be equal teacher m this is going to be our plate and this one okay make your plates quickly because it s not about the art work
it s about the math okay and you re not . you re not really following directions
brownies teacher m okay you re going to start thinking you re going to start thinking okay you might want to put a title on your paper as to what you re doing breaking brownies don t spend forever drawing pretty pictures
okay so . this is good
it i okay you need to do math so teacher m plates 4 plates on one paper 3 plates on the other too big okay that s one plate with 4 brownies on it
plates 4 plates with 3 brownies split equally or 3 plates with 4 brownies split equally
yet have you started at least opened up your paper and made your . okay you re spending more time being concerned about the places than the math
making 3 okay then make 3 triangles
did 1st 4 brownies and 3 people and to give each one and since there was one left and there s 3 plates i divided by 3 and then we got 13rd did you help them this also okay all right so you need to label and explain what you did and glue those down
you can write on the brownies you can write on the paper instructions you need to listen
right now take 3 brownies and figure out how you re going to split them equally on 4 plates okay well that s not fair to this person right so how are you going to do that you have to think about how you re going to split those brownies up equally okay lots of thinking
room teacher m no brownie so you re doing 3 brownies on 4 plates okay okay explain what you did
we cut the brownies in half and each person gets half of a brownie and put it into fourths and then each person gets okay so this represents what
what one half okay can you add one half +14th you better listen because if you cut this in half you 2 are going to work together and not argue also well no
half so then that would be 3 fourths okay okay so i would continue cutting my halves too so then it clearly shows 3 fourths for each because one half is the same as 2 . as one half is the same as 2 fourths right okay okay so you guys can go on and do the next one once you ve solved that one
okay so you ve got 4 people eating here halves 2 and one don t lose half a brownie 3 okay you re working what s doing
glue all right explain to me what you did girls we re doing the you re going to have to wait one into half 2 . 2 . 2 brownies into both of them in half so that equals 4 so half each one got half and what is half also equal to again 14th one half is equal to a 4th no it s equal to 2 fourths okay so
so then we so what is a half plus a 4th is what i m asking you ah . 3 because one half is equal to 2 fourths so then you have another half ah 2 fourths +14th 2 fourths +103 fourths yes very good
brownie so you have one more brownie what are you going to do with it brownies how are you going to give this person a you re on to something how half maybe you should cut them all in half and then see what you can do
yeah and then we ll have extras no cut them perfectly girls okay you ve got 4 brownies on 4 plates and 3 brownies on 3 plates but that s not i want you to do this plates i want 4 brownies on 3 plates okay that s where you have to think the rest of the brownies you don t need anymore okay 0 yeah so it would be how are you going to do it
brownies okay great
yes is this correct i m starting to see . how many brownies is this 3 yeah we cut it in . we cut it . we cut the other one in half so now what are you showing me it it s half of the . the bigger one represents what
represent this . if this was a whole brownie you just cut into what is this going to represent one half okay if this is half of this what s this represent 14th +14th is the same as what 14th +14th is the same as right okay so you ve got one half here and 14th here
too have 2 fourths 2 fourths +14th you ll be able to figure out exactly what the fraction is okay we had . we have 7 and we gave 2 to each then we started to forgot that we kept on getting not even wait i have to stop you instructions one plus that s what i was going to tell him but you didn t want to listen to me
bossy the instructions were 4 plates only the other one was 3 plates but 4 brownies only i did not ask you to put 7 brownies up among but this is correct good even though you didn t follow directions you did it right so that is good that okay okay you split 7 brownies among 4 plates you kind of made up your own problem i kind of like that but you also need to follow directions right
okay so now see if you can do 3 brownies on 4 plates take everything away except 3 and see if you can do that okay but you were right about that you did do that correctly but you didn t do what i asked you to do okay so now take 3 now how are you going to do 3 start by get rid of that one this 123 we have to divide this one into 2 you probably should do the same to all of them okay
okay divide them into so actually you know what you re doing but you made up your own problem that would have been good if you would have finished the 1st 2 already but you need to do the 2 i assigned you 1st equals 6 and 333 try it
what 11 not 11 i mean . one out of what 4 good 14th okay now can you tell me this because then we d have one big what s the total amount of brownie each person gets 4th one half +14th what if you split your half
crazy what if you split your half like this and then into 2 fourths then you ll have each person then can clearly see how much brownie each person s getting 3 yeah 3 fourths okay glue them down then you got it right here where s the 1st one the 1st one you have to glue it down
it s confusing it s hard no it s not where s your brownies okay i want you to do 3 brownies on this plate 123 how s this person going to get some brownies
here cut yes okay maybe cut them in halves and fourths and move the pieces around and see what s see if you can fit each plate equally
it half fourths cut them in halves 1st and then if that doesn t work if you still can t split them evenly then possibly cut them in fourths okay did you cut how did you cut them
i cut hem into thirds how many brownies is this how many total brownies is this this looks like 4 is it 4 or is it good so what is . how is that 3 brownies that looks way more than 3 brownies
explain we folded it in halves show me with that what you did did because you re how much are you saying is in each brownie halves because if these are halves that would be one.5 +one.5 that would be 3 brownies already
represent halves or fourths or don t you know the 1st one fourths they would have to represent fourths why good so that s a brownie 0 that s a brownie one whole and that s a brownie so you ve got 3 brownies split on 4 plates you re correct
okay so it s 3 fourths on each plate right 0 can we use no you have to use regular glue yes okay so write your . write your thoughts start gluing them down and write about it
i grabbed 3 brownies and then i cut them i cutted them in half and to everyone and one and then we just cut them good
you okay what in the world did you do to your brownies plate then how much more of the other brownie well no this would represent one brownie that would represent a brownie that would represent a brownie and then you have how much more of each
this represents a brownie this represents one brownie but you ve had to split this one into 3 parts so that everyone would get an equal amount so this is how much of a brownie 01 . half one out of not half one out of one out of 3 yeah one out of 3 good all right what we re going to do
more we re going to come back to the carpet for a minute and we re all going to discuss this brownie thing and then you can come back and finish them up and then maybe attempt to make a model to the other way i showed you far we re not done yet but we re going to take a little break and share our thoughts and then we re going to go back here 0 we re trying to figure out this one okay and how are you going to do that you think you ve got to move on from halves and fourths and think of a different fraction
it good okay we made faces out of 3 fourths good come to the carpet you don t have to bring your stuff
talking at 1st you had make room so people can come sit down s okay we re kind of tight on the carpet with 28 of you good you all at 1st you had no idea what to do
okay for these 4 plates i wanted to put 3 brownies equally and i wanted it to be fair it s not fair if i get if i m the 4th person and i don t get one is it
this this isn t fair either because here if you didn t . if you didn t split it up each person would get one but then is it fair that this person gets 2 brownies and person each get one about think about how which one do you want to talk about
one how did you and your friends you and and maybe were together having a party or whatever and how did you decide who got the extra brownie do we either way okay
that there s a there s if there s 3 if there s only 4 brownies this one is if there s only 3 brownies you can split all of them up
cut them in half and then each of them would have one . each of them would have 2 so we ll have to split them in half again okay so you can literally split them into fourths and then start putting pieces back up on the plates each get 33 little parts which represent what
bless you the brownie pieces of the brownie yeah but mathematically fractions 3 out of how many the whole . this is your whole with 4 little parts now right you did oops that person wanted more but there wasn t there okay so if this is your whole how much does each person get
face look at the 2nd one it s like a how much does each person get 3 fourths 3 fourths 3 fourths do you think 3 fourths +3 fourths +3 fourths +3 fourths equals 3 yes yeah yeah it does okay so how about this one so what you had to do was you had to get out your scissors and cut and think and split it up
well there was like . there was more brownies than how many people so we gave each of them one whole everybody got a whole so i d almost rather be at this party huh more all right and then there s one left and what are you going to do with that one you can divide it into 3 parts 3 parts that s where some of you good thirds now a lot of you got so used to halves and fourths in the 1st problem you weren t thinking that you could do thirds as ell
divide it into 3 parts and then you got one piece for each now how much brownie does each person get at this party
21 and 11 and 14th one and 13rd do you think one and 13rd +one and on 3rd +one and 13rd equals 4 yeah yes okay i have the reason why they why why because there s 3 people and it wouldn t be 4 people divided by 4 because then there d still be left or cut in half because then there wouldn t be enough right and some good
and some of you had a problem with some of you couldn t tell me a lot of you had it like this no that s where we have the denominators well maybe you couldn t think of that right away but once you split that apart and realized that that half was also 2 fourths it was easy to do
there one more thing real quick and then i m going to let you go back to your seats is i was talking with and and they had another problem that actually at 1st i told them they weren t following directions but i m glad they did it because it worked they re problem worked too right how d you do that 7 brownies on 4 plates right is that what it was
yeah way more brownies them all i would go to that party you would go to that party that well you got to make your you got to make your well so you can do this the same way right
yeah we divided in at 1st we gave each of them 2 split it up into 4 okay i think you had those . you had those . yeah you had them split up already but so if you did it this way you had it in halves but i m doing it in wholes okay
fair over here all of them together we put them cutted them into fourths 6 squares you cut them into fourths probably is what you did i m thinking okay and then you did it the same thing again how much does each person get here
one and 3 fourths one and 3 fourths one and 3 fourths you can do this problem with all kinds of numbers and i challenge some of you to try it with harder numbers plates 127 brownies on 62 plates why not it yeah all right it looks like good job
we have about 5 more minutes you can go back to your desk and get those brownies glued down and then after specials we ll talk about making the models we didn t get to the models yet but that s okay it looks like there s so much thinking going on already it looks like a face the head s been teacher m
yes when you came to our group did you tell us to just do 4 and 3 plates or i did 4 you can do i wanted you to do 4 on 3 and i wanted you to do 3 on 4 are we past time all right well if you want to keep it for a few more minutes that s fine where are we cutting fourths on another sheet of paper i gave you 2 pieces of paper where s your other piece of paper or do it on have you glued those down yet down those aren t where s your other sheet of paper
huh your other sheet of paper s right there yeah done name s are on everything yeah wait if you re done you can start thinking about making a model like i made earlier yay i m going to put that down too for those of you that are done
before we go to specials your goal is to get your body pieces glued down and all your names on your papers if you re ready to start a model i will put this back up for some of you to look at
remember i did a half times a 3rd but you can do anything when you do a model this paper will represent your grid right okay and we ll we ll do that more after music
you need to get glued get glued all right yeah yeah you re not literally gluing yourself
okay okay goes who s getting good at math who s getting good at math her me yes you too both of you you are yeah you always liked math but you girls did a good job too out now 3 fourths on each one and a 3rd on each okay
how did this how come you have so many pieces on this one did you cut that into ninths no fourths no you have to cut . you have to cut it into thirds you didn t i just explained all that right this one has to be cut into thirds so just pretend like these are thirds okay
all right kind of like don t you have another one take another one and cut it into thirds okay 2 leftover how are you going to all right this is your grid right
yes so how would you do something like now how i did one half +13rd i did some folding right why don t you guys try one half times 14th that would be 18th yes one half then make another 4th you re good at math
too so do these guys eighths now would that help you show one half and then this is where you could work on this model you can start making some sort of pattern like i made waves and we mountains we it s 14th and 14th and if we add it it will make 18th right but how would you draw that on your you would have to like have to make some sort of a decoration that s all over half the page
something then you make another decoration that s different all over a 4th of the page
it you are putting that right there it is just so that when they are fast forwarding through all of these videos they can see who is who
you know when they have a movie and they have that little thing that is like action cut
back i hope you enjoyed your lesson was there many differences between the book i am just interested fact you will probably find out when you see movies and books you probably already knew that but they are both very different there is usually more detail and back story in books
okay it is now math class we are going to get started started you are working in the student reference book i am also recording this for a study on effective math teaching
behavior today we are going to be investigating properties of geometric solids does anybody know what a geometric solid is or what it looks like or anything about it hand 3 dimensional it is a 3 dimensional shape 3 dimensional figure important do you ever see them in the world around us b let me think about it
i thought i knew pyramids one really popular example of a 3 dimensional solid is those great pyramids in egypt actually many other can you think of any other places you see geometric solids
yeah some of you saw the examples of cylinders from yesterday containers where do you see a cone yes the pentagon that is right u s defense department got their name from
pentagon how many sides would a pentagon have this it looks like it is going to be a hexagon sorry
what shape would this be considered just looking at it it doesn t seem to fit into some of the categories we have talked about familiar and let us get focused please
okay we started discussing 5 general groups of geometric solids cylinder what is this an example of cone a cone what is this an example of pyramid depending on the bottom it will determine what kind of pyramid
i think the pyramids of giza have a square bottom so we can call that a square pyramid we also this is a special example of what cube
attention i would really like you to be able to stay here together this is a cube a cube is what kind of geometric solid
pyramid it is not a cone it is a special kind of rectangular prism prism squares are really secret rectangles in disguise sphere so today i am going to be breaking you into 3 groups
the 1st group is group 3 is going to include and group 4 is going to include and okay
i am going to have when we start group 4 you guys are going to start in the back of the room working on some pages that are posted right there on the wall by okay i am going to start up here with group 3 group 2 is going to be in the back of the room and i am going to show you what you are going to be working on right now
ms b let me borrow some of her geometric solid nets the net is sort of a solid that has been flattened out broken i really appreciate the people who are listening or not talking and sitting still
much you will notice that there is sort of 2 sides to these please one side has ridges in it and the other side see these little dots in the middle of each panel the side with the dots on it is going to end up on the inside of the shape if you fold it the other way these little hinges can break
fragile so really make sure when you are using these make sure the dots end up in the center sense any idea what shape this can make
okay thank you do you know what shhh means
all right so you guys all know i checked what shape is this on the bottom hexagon so as i fold it it creates a pyramid
pyramid because the base of it is a hexagon pyramid what do you think why would we call this a pyramid
it has a point it has a point at the top it looks like what we know of as famous pyramids one what do we call this point part of it
it is an apex because it is at the top of the pyramid but the general word for it is a vertex which is just kind of like a pointy part of the shape all right for some of these shapes it might be hard for you to hold it together and write about it at the same time so that is when you might partner up with somebody in your group
if i was is partner might hold the shape or i might hold the shape and then you have some questions to answer about each shape you make okay so hexagonal pyramid is right here have so you and the person you are working with can figure out how many faces it has
is it has the one at the bottom and if it is a hexagon it is going to have one 2 3 4 5 6 stop i would really like you to think about what you are doing and if you thought about it you would think that is kind of distracting
that is rude that is not really helping me pay attention or you pay attention or the people around you pay attention is the bottom when you go to egypt you do not see the pyramids sitting here like this right do the base we can think of it as the part they are going to be resting on
there is a more mathematical definition but just the part it is resting on n a hexagon thank you the next question you are going to have to ask is how many edges does this shape have
have i would really appreciate it if you would raise your hand and we are not all talking over each other it is sort of basic courtesy how can you find out
solid if you have 2 faces coming together right where they meet that is going to form an edge right there okay another question you are going to have to ask is how many vertices are on each of the shapes confused i asked you to define vertex which we just talked about is a point right
but when you see the word vertices i do not want you to get too worried b it is going to be vertexes but it is going to be more than one exactly
vertices now the next question is an example of this in the real world now you might not find an example of every single shape the way it is in the real world this look at this shape imagination
maybe on the decoration of an old fashioned building like ornamentation on a building c a christmas tree i want you to be more specific than that k an interesting ice cream cone
yes a christmas tree it sort of looks christmas tree ish like a model christmas tree please okay tower pyramid a pyramid say that again
it looks like an egyptian pyramid a little bit right pyramid they are both called pyramids but the pyramid has a square base probably these have a square base
a hershey kiss maybe more of a teepee than a hershey kiss cover you are going to have a chance to write down these ideas so hold on to them you will have a chance to record them the next question i want you to do is sketch what the net looks like
about flatten it out and show me what this looks like flattened out it you don t have enough room to trace it so you are just going to have to look at it and figure out how all the pieces fit together if you think this is too small and want to work on a separate sheet of paper you will have to staple it on to this one the last thing you have to do is practice your sketching skills by sketching what it looks like as a solid as well
like that is what you are going to be doing in the back of that room please i only have 5 sets of these there is like 6 or 7 people in a group so you are going to have to share with the people in your group
as i said please do not fold these back and forth over and over again okay as i said do not fold it where the dots are on the outside
break you are going to start with about 10 minutes per station and then we will have some time after that to catch up room group 4 room who is going to be back here working with the geometric solids the worksheets for this activity are in the box on the yellow table
who is in that group that can take these with them let us get started
are you with that group you said 3 is here i asked 4 to start back there please i am going to talk to group 3 up here
okay i think i switched them up a little bit 4 hey guys
what group are you in
3 please you are supposed to be back there
know come back to your seats please can you put those back in the bags please
time i am still waiting for 5 people to sit down so we can get moving on this the way i planned it box i need to take care of them because ms
b bought them let us just clarify here yesterday group 2 includes all of these people here in this circle and
here group 4 you guys are going to be working on the workbook pages in the back of that room listen that includes and you are going to be in the back of that room that area i am pointing to and the workbook pages are posted okay
move the ziploc bags and the plastic bags and nets are all going to stay in that area down raise your hand if you are going to be starting in the back of that room
you excuse me here 3 what group is going to be with me one can you all quickly get where you need to be and start working
going you are right for some reason i did 234 and that was a really dumb move on my part out are you guys up here with me yes i am sorry about that confusion all right
bit what i want to do with you is compare sets of different kinds of shapes i want you to think of a rectangular prism versus a pyramid you with the people who are near you here is a pyramid and here is a prism
matter okay you guys get your math spirals out page we can organize ideas with this called a venn diagram you have got it a venn diagram i want you to make a venn diagram of prisms and pyramids
i want you to think about what do they have in common and what is different
apex we can say a prism does not have an apex i am going to ask you to work with us and copy down the things that are on the board
some of them have more bases i like that that is a good idea this just has one base on the bottom but a rectangular prism kind of has 2 bases its face can be a base sometimes can i borrow that
if it is 6 faces then it is 6 bases because each face can be a base that is right on a cube we maybe consider each side can be a base just remember that a prism can also be a triangular prism right
shape just the 2 sides that are triangular in shape
base hey guys
book see at the top of the page they kind of illustrated which ones are the bases in this is one base and this is the other base at the bottom give why do they just consider these the bases and not the sides
do you have a student reference book me it seems strange to me you with all these bases there is only 2 right it seems like there can not be more so a prism has how many bases
2 it just has 2 if it had more than 2 bases it would just be bases okay these are considered bases for the reasons that are listed here okay these bases have the same shape and size and they are parallel to each other
on a triangular prism the sides are not parallel i know a similarity they both have they both have more than one edge they will always have more than one edge what does both that is a similarity they will always have at least more than one edge i am trying to think
most shapes have more than one edge even 2 dimensional shapes that is a similarity i also noticed the bases are connected to each other so there is an edge that connects one base to the other every edge has a parallel or a buddy that it is connected with
parallel okay these how come this is not a base
no so some part of this face is closer to this than the other but on the bases every part of the 2 bases is equally far apart one side is not closer than the other you guys have 2 pages here about prisms an pyramids
anything else in looking at them that you can think of that they are similar or different
prism a pyramid the base is not the same size and shape okay how are they alike
them they have edges they both have edges
they all have a base okay
them and when you compare a pyramid to a prism they both have triangles this is a triangular prism so it does but we could also have a rectangular prism that doesn t have any triangles
shapes they both are shapes right if you look at any one side what do you see polygons so all the faces are polygons you could not really say that about a sphere because a sphere does not have one face
how many edges are coming together there is there every a place where please sit down is there ever a place in a rectangular prism where there is 4 no what we say about prisms is every vertex is made of 3 edges oops all right i am going to let you go if you have copied this down you are going to have to stay here one more time please rotate if you were back there come up here with me if you are using the nets can you work with the workbook pages in the back of the room i do not like that negativity what is the matter do you know what a pyramid is versus a rectangular prism do you want to make some of these you were not here yesterday you did not get to do that do you want to cut one up and glue it together is there really a yeah or are you making that up
no why do not you make one of those shapes you cut on the dark lines and fold on the dotted lines and put it together into a triangular prism all right you should be where you are supposed to be you guys all up here we missing anybody you guys are group 4 right can you open up your math spiral you know what this sort of organizational thing is called we are going to come up with them together i want you to make a venn diagram and we are going to be comparing pyramids to prisms they sort of help each other right yesterday you guys made examples of prisms so here is a couple examples of prisms if you can also open up your student reference book to page 140 it has some good background information in page 140 and 141 in your srb okay we are going to be comparing and contrasting rectangular prisms to pyramids in this case i have some examples of pyramids over here checking with the people at your table can you think of anything that is similar about a pyramid here is a pyramid versus a prism things that are similar things that are different does that work with this one sit down let us work this out
what have you guys talked about so far i would appreciate it if you would say that out loud they both have only flat faces we decided both of them have vertexes and edges they both have one base they both have flat faces i like some of what you said some things i have questions about okay i want you to focus on not what we call them although sometimes a little bit about what we call them but the sort of shape and characteristics of the shape itself their names their bases sometimes like an octagonal pyramid then like both of their bases are named after their bases you have got it
okay so this is what kind of prism would we call this triangular triangular prism and what kind of prism is this rectangular what kind of pyramid is this square and what kind of pyramid is this 3 d did you write this down because this applies to both of them i am going to put that in the center in your math spiral i want you to have a venn diagram okay someone has mentioned bases if you look at page 140 there is sort of a description of a base how many bases does a pyramid have one it just has one
these guys here but if they went the other way then they they both have shapes inside of them so let us about prisms prisms have how many bases 122 prisms have 2 and how many do pyramids have one i already put that down good i call this a super pyramid a super pyramid someone said something about the shapes in both of these yeah both shapes yeah what kind of shapes okay what kind like triangles yeah here is a triangle here is a rectangle and and the more triangles in general we call those polygons okay so both of them have polygons what part of the shape is a polygon it is like a what do we call these parts of the shape faces yeah so the faces are polygons okay what else could we say a similarity or difference how are these different than spheres and cones
well neither of them have round edges all right so neither of them has curved surfaces or we could say both of them have what kind of surfaces edged flat flat well you also could say edged because they have edges and cones don t do you need tape removed for that there is some on my desk you can start taking the tabs down take the tabs down now the faces are flat what about the edges are the edges curved or flat they are straight or straight straight yeah the edges are straight both of them are just long or neither or
some of them can have both both are they curved or straight straight yep so both have straight edges have flat surfaces and i am just going to add straight edges can we talk about the vertices of these shapes what do you notice about every vertex on a prism there is more than one okay is that true about pyramids well the pyramid can have more it can have like 4 yeah where would that happen cause of for a square because a square has for like corners so 4 come up
so 4 go up and meet at the top at the apex so on a prism all vertexes i am sorry vertices have please stop have 3 edges is that the way we say that all vertices have 3 edges and then on pyramids some vertices vertices have 3 or more edges may have more than some vertices may have more than 3 edges meet and prisms all vertices have 3 edges meeting okay did you fit all that in there if it is tight you can maybe just draw an arrow or something so you can get it all in on did you all have a chance to talk about prisms and pyramids yet some vertices have more than 3 edges meet so at the point of a pyramid there is 1234 on this particular pyramid it is a square pyramid 4 edges are coming together that would never happen in a prism all right have you guys had a chance to be back here yet nope no we have back there look where i am pointing i haven t look where i am pointing 0 no
all right let us switch please if you are working on the workbook come on up here oops oops if you are playing with the nets come on and work on the workbook pages should you bring your math spiral you don t need to hm what are we working on teacher are we working in here over there yeah on the workbook page 0 in the math room let us switch please come on waiting on you it is written right there by the window okay group 3 if you could move towards the front of the room what group are you in
i will save that for the whole week what are you doing i am not saying i am not interested in that but what are you supposed to be doing 0 i finished my math music where is your group here then come on up please all right boys and girls can you please open up your math spiral yeah i need students c b k r and s to open up your math spirals where are they where would they go i just saw them a minute ago can you go to the office i don t appreciate your attitude you ve already been once i would ve thought you would learned your lesson what page in our math spiral next page please next page please new page hurry up we are going to be comparing prisms and pyramids if you don t have some examples of prisms and pyramids i can give you some where is your math spiral in my bag
3 i should have 3 more people you up here with us no where are you supposed to be i didn t get the last thing do i need to take a minute i have most of it 6 really are you here yeah just a minute can you move up to the front of the room please okay also open up your student reference book to page 140 and 141
with the people that you are sitting near i want you to try and think about what is similar about a prism compared to a pyramid and what is different when we compare prisms and pyramids you each have some examples of these solids at your tables well the thing is you want to sit here so you can talk to these guys i am really frustrated that i have talked to you about that and you are still doing it
it can there be 6 spaces because you will have to talk with teacher c cause i am working with these folks right now so with prisms you have 2 bases instead of an apex so one base takes the place of the apex while the other takes the place of the other base and what is similar about them is that they both originally have at least one like since they both have a base that is the same shape the base always has that same shape that tells the kind of pyramid slash pyramid okay i hear you guys having some good conversations let us share what we got in your math spiral i want you have a venn diagram remember a venn diagram compares things that are similar about 2 groups as well as things that are different about both of them okay did anybody notice a similarity or a difference between pyramids and prisms
3 d okay they are both geometric solids okay anything else about them that is similar that they both have bases and vertices and edges and faces okay how are you started by saying they are both 3 d how are these 3 d shapes different than like a cone or a sphere a cone and a sphere a cone and a sphere are both 3 d
you keep saying 3 always 3 always 3 can we find a point on a rectangular prism or any prism where there is more edges that come together more than 3 edges coming together yeah yeah where n an octagonal prism on the apex i mean no the pyramid 0 but i am talking about i am just talking about prisms 0 then no it is not
okay so prisms come together in the same vertex how many forms the vertex yeah what is the most edges that come to make a vertex so prisms always have 3 edges making each vertex but pyramids like on the apex they can have more than that so they can have more than 3 always have 3 edges making each one anything else that they have in common or are different what kind of pyramid is this what kind of pyramid is this
it is a square pyramid it is a square pyramid okay what kind of pyramid is this triangular triangular pyramid what kind of prism is this triangular what kind of prism is this triangle it is triangular a triangular prism and what kind of prism is this rectangular so do these shapes have anything in common with how we refer to them yeah the face is the same shape as what you call it
yeah they are both named after their base except for a cone then we just call it a circle well we ll get into cones later i am just focusing on prisms and pyramids and also a cube you don t call it like the face you would call it a square that is why we call it a cube that is a special kind so both of these are named after their base okay now i have a question for you how do we know what the base is we call this a triangular prism but it has a rectangle right here could this be its base why is not this its base
those are not parallel to the other one and usually there is so one thing about bases is that they are parallel to each other so if i put my hands it could be the base but it is not the 1st base prisms the bases have to be parallel because this they are not parallel so bases if i hold this like this how do i know that these 2 sides are not parallel because your hands are like this yeah my hands are going towards each other right yeah your hands are intersecting and parallel can not if i hold it like this are my hands ever going to converge no
parallel that is why we know these are the bases not these sides here you can also think about how the bases are connected to each other by like the edges yeah they are connected to each other by an edge whereas the sides are connected to some of the other sides by an edge but not to all of them anything we can write up here about that yeah really okay bases are parallel okay and how many pyramids only so how many bases have one a pyramid has how many bases
okay all righty thank you all right ladies and gentlemen raise your fingers for the number of minutes you think you need to finish your morning work 4 i see one
let s do 4 minutes doing we re doing okay but did you show me any of your work answers i see is showing me his work on his paper
i love it excellent that s a very good strategy
did you double check your work
did you make sure you had work for all the answers and you d be able to explain it to your group when you get there
okay remember you need to be able to show or explain how you got your answer because you re going to have to defend your answer when you re in group
is allowed a question yes show me some work how are you going to prove that to your teammates good
now finish that up okay how are you doing show me what you re thinking on paper all right i saw you doing some work and i need to know what you were thinking
seconds how would you use that to show change in temperature
pictures how do we tell what the temperature is do we tell it by pictures or by numbers by numbers would you see numbers on a pictograph no you can underline information but we re not solving that one
class cause we have to each figure out what the criteria is to answer that question correctly gentlemen please don t worry if you haven t finished all discussion so everybody pencils are down
please forward your papers to the beginning and i will wait to see that everybody is sitting like this whole side of the room is sitting in the way i need them to be so that i know i have their full attention so we have been doing mcas work for before school work and breaking into small groups right and talking about how we got our answer choices
so we re going to take all of that that we normally do and now we re going to play a game call mcas wars i m going to explain to you the general way that it works and then we re going to come up with a list of rules that we think we should have in place in order for it to do the job that we re supposed to do so 1st what happens is you guys are going to break up into small teams
6 you re going to discuss your answer choices like you would normally do when we do mcas for before school work groups in your 2 bigger groups you re also going to have a discussion and hopefully all your answers will be the same
however as a team if one of your teammates did not get the correct answer and cannot explain the answer your job is to teach them your thinking
so that if i pick their name from the stick they should then be able to come up not only should they be able to get the right answer but because you did such a good job as a team they should be able to explain how your team came up with the answer does anybody want to give me . go ahead instrument why don t you go tell teacher m you don t have your instrument and teacher h would rather have you in class
so is there anybody who doesn t understand what we re going to do so far for the morning team teacher h is going to put the mcas question on the board time so there are 9 questions sometimes if one team does not get the answer the 2nd team gets a chance to solve for the correct answer
you get extra points for being able to explain to the group how you got your answer that so the purpose is not to have winners or losers cause you re all winners right the purpose is to have fun enjoy yourselves and learn something in the process so we re pretty good about not having bad feelings if our team doesn t win and we don t want to have any sore sports
some people can t get up and talk in front of a group so they might be a little nervous and might not be able to spit it out and say what they have to say sometimes like teacher h does super competitive however there s a little competition and we want to be the team that wins the most points establish 1st we ll look at our objective and we ll see what rules we might need to have
i will be able . i will be able to with work shown deal i have already made your groups according to our star map
all the groups is everybody of different ranges and i will adjust accordingly to who s here and who s not paper so we re going to have our discussions about the answer choices minutes if everybody agrees on the answer you can move on
answer so all set i m going to have and i m going to have and over here
and you can go work in that corner and you can work at the hexagon table
once you get to your groups i want everybody to stop because i want to make sure we re all clear on what we re supposed to be doing seat now that we re in our groups who can explain to me what you re going to do in the group i would like somebody to repeat to me what the directions are for working in a group
a we will all discuss the question and we will show our work why we . go ahead i m sorry if we who agrees with that i think she s got that fabulously how can we turn some of that into rules
do anybody remember the 1st thing she said so there has to be a discussion right
mcas rules you must discuss your answer choices well this is what we re going to do small group this is what you re going to do whole group what else
word you need to show or explain thank you t anybody else remember some things that she said k when you disagree you have to tell why you disagree excellent we can t just say no you re wrong
discussion if you disagree you have to explain why
that what s a word i m going to look for the way your manner that you should have when you re having this disagreement minute say it politely politely if you disagree you must explain why
you re all going to try and get me on my spelling now else 01 of the most important things all of your teammates must be able to do what when they get to the board j well yes we have that
so it s your job to do what if your teammate does not know the answer
only speak when it is your turn or when you ve having discussion when somebody is up here at the board the teammates can t say anything
simple they re most of the rules that we follow with the small group so we re going to try it in the big group okay teacher h is going to give you about 5 minutes we ll see how far along we get everybody gets to say their choice that they chose if there s a disagreement there s a discussion about why the right answer is the right answer or why you think your answer is the right answer
it is your job to help someone understand how to get the correct answer timer all right go ahead so let s hear it
number one is d d everybody has an explanation i see that almost everybody showed how they got their answer we have information written next to it
so if i pick your name for that question you re going to be able to explain to me how you got your answer right 2 you guys all go around again give your answer choices if you agree that s fabulous did you say have a discussion yes on number 2 are we having an agreement or any disagreements
i don t know how to explain what i got so this is good said she doesn t know how to explain it so somebody well can you tell me what you did for your work
this in the one space and these 2 in the other and then i got 117
them she has the right answer yes can somebody possibly look at her paper and help her explain cause she needs to be able to do that at the board or maybe you could show her a different way she could explain the answer quickly though cause we have a few minutes
did we all have the same answer or did we have different answers
had a different answer so are we now explaining to how we got our different answer
him i was saying that she has 11 $10 bills and i said if you count by 10s then you get 110 7 so that s what i added very good
me i didn t know that we had to multiply the numbers so explain to me now how to get the answer you times 10 times that s 10 times 11
okay so why are we doing 10 times 11 cause she has 11 $10 bills okay 110 and she has 7 one bills so is going to be 117 excellent good job explaining and good job restating
problem are we having a polite disagreement or are we shouting out of turn
n with number 4 it says tomika made a model of a house as shown below by gluing together a cube and a square prism
how many faces does the model of the house have can you tell me why you put 9
counting no can you show me on the pyramid and on the square how you did it said he counted all 4 sides of the top of the pyramid and then he counted the 5 sides on the cube
that you seem to disagree
disagreement i thought it would be 8 why did you think it was going to be 88 why did you think it was going to be 81234 and 1234 so did you not count the bottom of the cube
is that what happened can i never mind i m not even going to ask that question because i m afraid i m going to confuse you ahead get your eraser 54321
hands on heads hands on heads please thank you i m going to ask each group where they are in their discussion what number you re on or what number you re going to next d 5745 okay
5 more minutes yes group you re going to take your mcas paper that you were working on and you re going to go sit with can you guys catch up to speed
he did one and we need to explain to him how to get these answers a there s a pencil on the floor is that yours all right how did you do in your discussions
we had a little disagreement okay good one for n 2 for b 3 for c and 4 for d i picked 3 he picked 4 he picked 2 and so has d has d
have i m rereading the say it again b so we have 2 have b we have a b a c and a g all right let me explain how i got my answer okay s going to explain how she got her answer wait a minute and then you guys are going to explain how you got your answers and see which one makes more sense go ahead i want to hear okay i did 5 divided by and i got 8
so it says equal so i didn t copy that then i went to b -5 equals 40 i didn t think it was none of those you didn t think it was addition or subtraction
subtraction because 5 you have more than you ll have like a lot okay it s subtraction of what it equals okay
bigger smaller what number s getting smaller all where s the number getting smaller so would it be subtraction or division
it would be multiplication right because 5 times 8 will equal 40 d you re changing your answer now so tell me how you understand
why did you change your mind
now why d okay so now it s your job to explain to him why the answer is d
that so can you explain you can t just say because 5 times 8 is 40 because he but he doesn t know why 5 times 8 is 40 him s group are you guys done
ready can you show him in numbers how for each book he earns . how do we know he read 8 books
besides the fact that 5 times 8 equals 40 how do we know he read 8 books one will you grab that for me please he skipped one tell him that
you must have 5 people in a group
will you hang onto these for me please 54321
done 999955 we re going a little . we re going to 6 you re going to 6 war so you know what you guys can do
while you re waiting why don t you take a look at the pan balance open response question don t write anything down but perhaps you could read it and have a little discussion about what you think the criteria might be for getting a 4
can you hang onto these for me
thanks what happened okay i m just going to ask you to hang onto those sticks for me please okay
sorry honey group i didn t understand the question until explained it to me
round yeah i told him that for number 9 okay i told him that you know it s 8 rows and 28 over this to make each row so it says which one is the closest amount moved to the raymond school sweetie you so you know like if you did 8 times 20 it would be 8 more 8 so
if you did 8 times 30 it would be 2 more than that so 28 so that s how i explained it to him that s the best that i can do sweetheart i tried to well i know honey cause my pencil isn t sharp enough would you give her one please
fabulous where are you getting the 36 from can i ask you
so you re starting from the bottom and working your way down me now do you see what your teammates are doing okay because if i call you up to the board for this answer you need to be able to show how you got your answer
no that s okay honey because everybody s having such good conversation i would rather not . is your group finished yes okay do you understand where they re getting their numbers from
don t write any answers but you can start to have a discussion about how you might find your answers but i don t want you to write anything down information are you boys participating in the discussion please because listen to me you re going to have to be able to explain your thinking or your team s thinking when you get to the board
offer so why don t you skoosh up with the class with your group are you helping up did you explain to how to get the answers or did you just give him the answers
5 okay cause it was saying like 40 stickers and 5 stickers so then he said 8 and i didn t even know he knew that so i asked him did you think that was easy and then he said yes okay very good stuff how about you take a peek at this
up they re having good discussion so i want them to keep their discussion going j i don t want you to write any answers but i want you to have a discussion about how you might go about solving but i don t want you to use your pencils cause this is going to be something we do individually
well can you explain to cause he has that right j so miss roderick she has 8 books itself then she has 28 of ribbon to make each bow
which of the following selection has the value as closest to the amount of ribbon in inches 28 is closest to 30 and we re rounding to the nearest 10 so it would be 30 right and that would leave the 8 by itself
here 54321 hands on heads
i m going to ask that s row and s row quietly as possible s row 1st s row 1st come up push your desks back and then go sit back with your group here then go back to your group
back i will have s row is going to move their desks back please are you in s row group your team is waiting for the next direction please
please now teacher h is going to take your small groups and i m going to make 2 teams so we re going to put you together in 2 teams
i m going to have s team join this team please i m going to have s team i hope i m not hearing any negative comments things you people need to come over here and you need to make a circle
team teams get together in tight circles to discuss their strategies right just like a football huddle up let in he needs to be in the huddle circle i will sharpen your pencil
circle you re going to have to borrow somebody s pencil
later this is all we re going to do we re going to go around the circle we re going to all say our answer choice for all 9 multiple choice questions
right if there s a disagreement i want you to immediately raise your hand so that i know that 2 groups disagree cause that s half your team is going to have a problem explaining stuff one go around the group say your answer choice and make sure everybody is in agreement
correct be respectful please
i hear some noises that i don t think are appropriate for just going around and saying a letter choices yes
we have a disagreement what do you disagree on ah so i see that you and were on separate teams can you explain to how you got your answer and then s going to explain to you how he got his answer ahead explain it out loud honey
did and then i did 6 and then i multiplied it by then multiplication and then i got 30
r so we started with 5 so then we said we d count by 5s the next rows we counted by 6 do you see that
that they re counting by 5s in the 1st row and they re counting by 6s in the 2nd row is what she s telling you then on the bottom we started counting until we got to 66 then on the 1st row then we did stop at 25 and then we kept going and we got 55 on the bottom and that s how we did it
where did you get the number 66 from because we were counting by 6 okay but why did you stop at 66 cause there were no numbers after 66 except number 72 then we knew 72 couldn t be in this row what number did you stop at
i stopped at 65 and then when we discussed it with our group they told me it was all k 56 i don t know why
d we did it because i was thinking that because like it was 30 the highest 30 is half of an hour and if you stayed for an hour ¢25 is half of ¢50 so it would be ¢50 do you understand her reasoning cause she says 30 minutes is half an hour right ¢25 for each half an hour
60 wow i see the light dawning in s head so now do you know how you got your answer could you explain it when you get to the board i can t give you any more help cause you were supposed to have a discussion
i can say that s team does not have the correct answer when we go to the board you may or may not have this answer i will give you a minute to discuss why the correct answer is the correct answer start some people are losing their self control
so we re going to have team one and team 2 have you will have about 30 seconds to debate and make sure everybody has the same answer
i believe this is the only group that has a disagreement with one of the answers if they choose that question i m going to give them a minute for discussion as we already a discussion but we re still not sure i think
page is that okay now nervous here we go one we can see the bottom answer choice right
so i am going to start with team one i m going to pick their stick and they re going to come answer the question and they need to either show on the board or explain with words how they got their answer up use your black marker and show or explain
everybody all which of the following squares has 3 fifths shaded so what was the answer choice your group chose d do you have work on your paper
paper it says that 3 change fifths and these are 38s so i crossed these out one why did you not choose that answer
cause if this box was bigger it could have kept going okay can somebody else tell me why from this group why you wouldn t have picked that x we wouldn t have picked that because they aren t all the same shape because 2 are triangles and one is a big strip who agrees with that okay so they re not equal amounts right and that s what fractions are equal parts
good so d has okay the same size equal parts what fraction would you put with that 3 fifths 3 fifths good all right so team 2 it s team 2 s turn
you have your own question number 2 this has a little bit more of an explanation to go with it a i m just going to make it a little bit bigger honey go let s all read the question before starts please
she made the table below to show how much money she has so what s the title of the graph multiple students money what are the 2 columns in the chart type of bill one bill so type of bill numbers of bills
have $10 bills and one bills how many does she have of the $10 bills question table how much money does karen have now is going to either show us with math or explain how she got her answer
dear that s all right you don t need to erase anything
it why because . you re correct it because they were but how did you know to multiply them
much so you knew the number was going to get times okay 11 then i got 10 and i did with the ones and i got 100
i took this number and plussed it with 7 and i got this number where did you get the number 7 from do i plussed it with 100 and . okay did you multiply the 7 with anything no not because it doesn t say so
if we times the 7 with another number we wouldn t get any of these well if you multiplied 7 times one would that still be 7 okay so she multiplied 10 times 11 because she has 11 $10 bills 7 times one because she has 7 one bills so she multiplied 10 times 11 cause that was a little harder got 110
she knows that 7 times one is 7 so she didn t have to put that down on paper 2 team one you re back up for question number 3 i m going to ask the next person from team one to erase the board while you re waiting for teacher h
can you erase okay we re moving onto question number 3 and 4 thank you honey you guys are doing a fabulous job by the way
i have to say you re sitting patiently and politely and i think that s wonderful i hope you re listening to people s explanations and getting some information for yourselves as well graph how do we know that a line graph is best to show change of temperature over time question which of the following is the best way for mister
gomez to show the change in the average temperature each day chose a line graph other choices are a tally chart a pictograph and a circle chart choice cause you can put the temperatures on the bottom can you show me how you would do it
correct he s saying you can put the temperatures on the bottom that is a line graph
bottom what would you put on the bottom time what time 0 what day day right i m going to just abbreviate and now do your numbers
don t worry okay time how would you use a tally chart to show change in temperature over time
you could do that with the weather every day you could do it with the weather but temperature we use what do we use sunny faces and cloudy faces
things for temperature we use would i say it s a smiley faced sun outside today no what does it use numbers numbers right pictures whoops i ll get that honey thank you
job team 2 question number 4 this was some discussion for some people on team 2 so hopefully i picked the right one what i m sorry team one needs their point man everybody let s read the question please
2nd put your pencil down pick your paper up and read with your classmates please the question everybody last summer 0 i m so sorry
sorry so you re going to circle your answer choice and then you re going to explain to us either in words or with some math what you re thinking was and eyes up cause you want to see what he s doing
it might be a little bit different than what you re doing and maybe you ll find his strategy was easier than yours 8 d did you mean you mean d b how did you know you were supposed to put an 8 there
d is the answer but how did you know that the letter b should be the number 8 i still counted to 40 and then i counted my fingers and it was 8 strategy that s a pretty easy strategy don t you think 30 i m sorry i m taking over your job
8 pretty simple strategy by this is what he ended with and it took him 8 times to do that
point you guys are fabulous so far nobody s made any serious errors if you think teacher h is taking over too much on your turn please let me know
myself teacher h you should do a count in order to just do this i think that s what i m going to do cause i do it anyway so we might as well do it this way question number 4 and question number 6
b 0 let s read the question before gets up here tomika made a model of a house as shown below by gluing together a cube and a square prism how many faces does the model of the house have so pick your answer choice
marker then i want you to show me or explain to me how you got your answer i counted the sides can you show me what you did attention okay do you see what he did
he marked each side so he has 12345 i m not sure where he got that one from
this one s from the bottom okay all right then 1234 this is the one we can t see information i counted he counted it up that who put either numbers or lines to mark each face
n all i did was count and put the numbers so as you were counting you put the number yes so you used the number 12345 no
you its sides but she wasn t using the top one so i started and i know that 5 and then 4 at the top because did you hear what she said
normally she knew it had 6 faces but she wasn t counting the top because she was putting the top of the square pyramid and the top of the cube together right so she wasn t using those 6 she took one away cause we weren t using the top and she knew the square pyramid had 5 but she took one away because we weren t using the bottom
you number 6 team 2 gets a point was it team 2 or team one team one team one i m sorry point team 6 multiple students team 6
question 6 team 2 yes i m going to get to that student n please all of the numbers cindy wrote in the box shown below are even numbers and multiple of 3
which of the following is also an even number and a multiple of 3 well let s read the choices in the box 24 do we agree they are even numbers n you can always tell it s an even number by the one space if it s 246 or 8 and what other number
0 excellent explanation you look at the number in the one space and if it s 2468 or 0 we know it s an even number are they multiples of 3 yes how do you know j cause if you count by 3s you ll land on those numbers 0 wonderful
numbers okay now it s your turn so i knew that 10 times 3 equals 30 and before i used to think that the answer was 26 but then told me that it s not really 26 cause if you count by 3s then you end up 24 and the going to be on 27
okay so now i know that 10 -3 equals 30 although very good so i would say that gave a very good explanation of why 26 was not the correct answer right 0 wants you to circle the letter so we know we re all getting the right answer
explanation didn t understand so explained it to him that if 24 is a multiple of 3 and you add 3 to that you wouldn t get on 26 you would skip that and get to the number what s 24 +3 27 so you would be skipping over 26 so if you continue to skip count you would not land on any of these numbers except for 30
then he proved it by doing multiplication with the number 3 teammate thank you it s not an even multiple of 3 thank you
ball well that s okay because we have a tie breaker i ll tell you about the tie breaker we have very few moments left m is answering number 7 show or explain how you got your work
up number 8 s going to be the tie breaker i ll explain that to you in a minute
because it said how many more and when i was in 3rd grade my teacher put keys like addition and subtraction and i saw how many more of the subtraction keys so is remembering from fabulous teacher from last year she had the key chart and for each function you guys had to find the key words right
so remembered key words are how many more which means you have to find the difference by subtracting good so that was team one team 2 you re doing question number 9 then if we can we ll get the tie breaker in before we go to specialist
polite if you have to raise your hand to tell me something please do so along number 9 you need to know who s going to answer them number 9
i apologize if not everybody got a turn but i think you guys are doing this is the most fabulous respectful mcas war i ve ever had i see everybody s paying attention everybody s listening to their group mates
can we do it again soon we will absolutely do this again i usually try to do this on a friday if we get all our regular math work done 28 so i rounded it and so then i got 30
but i did are you listening 28 equals times 240 said so she rounded 28 to 30 30 because it says to the closest okay closest which means you had to get close
what you didn t have to get the exact number but how did you know that 28 was rounded to 30
why cause when we round we re supposed to start at the ones column 1st if you re rounding to the next . 10th okay good and you know that . 28 is closest to 30 that cause i rounded how did you round it
10 cause 8 is a bigger number so if 8 is bigger than 5 then i round the 10s column to the nearest 10
tie breaker each team comes up at the same time they have to do the work on the board to show or explain how they got their answer pencils down
people i m not going to show you i m going to get the tie breaker up
i wish i could move this over but i don t think that i can i m going to shrink it a little bit so that one person is going to work on that side of the problem so team 2 is going to work here team one s going to work here are we ready and come on up
down all right yes you re going to work over here woman here i will give you magnet to hold you paper so you can see la all right take the caps off your pens on your mark get set go
0 i think you re answering the wrong question one
number 8 that s all right you re not supposed to shout out turn they both have the right answer do we agree
differently yes cause used the minutes and used the cents but they both knew that 30 minutes +30 minutes equals 60 minutes so 25 +25 would be 50 nice job give them both a round of applause you are all winners today
this we re going to work on the open response problem tomorrow because we may have to establish new criteria for that back did you destroy s thing i did
please just go place your please place your paper and your pencil on your desk and walk to line quietly that i don t like the one you don t like the one or you do
morning good morning we are going to continue our lesson on conversion of units
system well is something we use but that s not the name of the system close customary the customary system and we have units of what s one of them of you can do capacity
remember if i gave you 12 inches how many feet 12 inches how many feet good if i give you 100 centimeters how many meters questions £2000 equals what
gallons how many quarts 2 gallons how many quarts 88 32 fluid ounces good 3 yards feet 12
do 3 times 4 why did you do 3 times 4 i thought that 4 feet were in a yard okay there s a mistake 4 feet are there 4 feet in a yard no shhh how many feet are in one yard
feet a yard huh he said there are 3 feet in every yard go let s see what you remember one metric cup is how many milliliters one metric cup how many milliliters good what does 1000 milliliters equal
1000 milliliters one liter equals one liter or how many metric cups m what did you say think said that 250 milliliters is one metric cup
what s 1000 milliliters 3 we re not playing a guessing game 45 now we re just guessing m 250 milliliters is one metric cup
how many metric cups is 1000 milliliters 4 how did you get 44 times no . 0 she doesn t know 4 250 times 4 is what
4 in the 1st but you can do guess and check do 50 times 4 is 1000 but since we didn t know 4 and we don t want to guess and check how could i have used what i knew already to figure out it was 4 n you could have used 250 divided by 1000 1000 250 divided by 1000
0 1000 1000 divided by 250 equals 4 equals 4 okay
right yes ma am what s guess and check guess and check is a strategy we use if we don t know okay how would you guess and check what we just did if you were doing 250 times 4
yourself how come you can check your multiplication by division what s the difference the number is what s the difference between multiplication and division
in division it s in multiplication the sum is 4 times 4 equals 16 division is just 16 divided by 4 so give me one word to describe them
good so is addition and subtraction are they the opposite of multiplication and division no so can you use addition or subtraction to check your multiplication no
yes if you use addition you can use addition to check your multiplication no can but is it going to be efficient no
efficient all right we were working on our partner assignments with units of measurement partners i would like you to come work with and
get back to your area i would look at number 6 again if i were you
again let me see what we ve got so far no that s not right i might look again at number 6 again if i were you guys okay
i know you weren t here and you weren t here so i might look at number 6 again just to let you know are you paying attention or are you playing with your pencil come on
on i need you with me system okay they are measure but which of the 2 systems
system what are they like that s in the customary system what are kilometers like tons measure length no
tons measure weight right okay are kilometers short or long that s where we re having trouble so what are they like from the customary system had you were giving me weight now you re giving me capacity
length length length feet feet feet like more like miles then yes
if kilometers are like miles they re long right miles because isn t that the distance well all of them are distance and length right but what s wrong with trying to measure your swimming pool using miles they re too long what s too long the miles
big and if kilometers are like miles then what would be the problem trying to measure your swimming pool in kilometers it would be too long kilometers are too big to measure your swimming pool okay you would need to use a larger unit or a smaller unit smaller unit you would need to use a smaller unit okay so as you re double checking your work keep that in mind okay
doing 0 we re doing a wonderful job of sharpening our pencil so let s do a good job of working on these questions all right let s look at what we ve got
i m going to allow this group to work a little bit longer and then i ll come back and when i come back i expect a lot more progress than what i see right now okay sure yes sir 0 okay because yesterday we was looking at my notes and that s how we okay i ll be right back
i m going to dispose of this did we use our notes when we completed this okay i m going to make sure let me see your notes that you used
and the other set of notes are here at we can re do it and we would get a different grade this is for practice
mister this back page
job and i see we eliminated wrong answers so that was good what would be wrong trying to measure your swimming pool in centimeters that it would take a long time because centimeters aren t that big they re like that yeah and like you need a bigger unit
that kilometers is close to a mile and so if you have a mile pool you ll drown unless you have some scuba gear but that s too 0 so you re saying miles is that s too much the unit is too large okay so you couldn t use it because well feet wasn t a choice meters are yeah meters are closest to feet okay what unit are meters what s the system
metric okay because if you every time you go to the pool it says feet but meters are closer to feet okay i ll take that good what i want you to do is to look over numbers 24 and 7 because i m not sure i agree with those
so i want you to double check them and see if you can find a better choice for those questions okay
5 16 times 5 2 so it can t be that i said 4 times 16
incorrect because it says one is 16 ounces so if we do £2 it would be 2 ounces so it cannot be a sentence it says £2 equals 33 ounces 0
okay so i agree with i know what i m doing because i m thinking it all say equals that s where okay back i m going to let you re work that problem and i ll be back
did work all the time i think that s a good idea
okay i like most of your responses on this page except i have a question about that one and i have a question about this one
this 17 meters is 170 centimeters because there s 10 centimeters in one meter really no
me no she s doing all right checking her notes it you want to know how many you re comparing centimeters to meters right
yes so how many centimeters does it take to make a meter
other all right wait wait wait and i also want to look at number 9 because it says one and 5 tenths kiloliters is equal to how many liters you the wrong one how many liters this is number 9 i m talking about this one how many liters does it take to make a kiloliter how many liters 1000
okay so if you have one and 5 tenths or one.5 kiloliters i don t know if i agree with that 15000 liters 500 okay and i m going to look at the rest of these here and see how we did i think we did better on the back i agree with a lot of these answers
not so much with 4 and 7 so i want you guys to try to rework those problems okay make sure especially on number 7 you use this information that you re given okay use that and make sure you look at the symbols in between the comparisons 0 it s the other way how many centimeters are in one meter
centimeters in one meter remember when we had the big meter stick okay so use that for number 14 please as you re doing that one okay i want to look at the rest of 0 you haven t even tried the other ones
page i would like you to revisit also number 4 and number 7 make sure number 7 you use this information
okay how many centimeters long is the stage okay if the stage is 17 meters long how many centimeters is the stage so how many 17 meters is how many centimeters yeah you show me
back i want you to revisit number 9 also
okay no all right now i m going to tell you and i can t tell you which because i don t want to give it away
work i want you to find the one problem out of the 3 that you had to correct the one that s still not quite right are so i want you guys that s not right there s one that s still not quite right there s 2 that you fixed properly
one s not quite right but i m not going to tell you which one you guys got to go and figure out which 2 are correct there was 4 that was wrong there were 4 wrong no there were 3 yeah the back page was fine so one is not right you you have to figure it out so this forces you to double check all of your work from those 3 to see which one is not right
i like your answer for number 7 we re having trouble with number 6 yes cause isn t this a fraction yes it is
it slow down it s the same thing it s the same thing unit inches so what a big unit to a small unit yes but wait down we re trying to rush
trouble but i don t get those 4 that means you need to slow down so you can understand don t just rush through it you re going from which type of what is the name of the 2 units that you re converting between yards yards and inches what is ultimately what do you need to know how many yards are in an inch ahh inches are in a yard you need to know how many inches are in one yard
you need to know how many feet are in one yard well you can use that yard that s what i want you to get to right now 36 cause i did 12 times 3
3 because 3 feet go into a yard and 12 inches go into a foot okay now what i would like you to do is quit trying to beat each other with the answer that s when you start making mistakes because you start fumbling over the words
okay it s not a competition between you 2 are working together here yard and the question is simply asking if you have 3 fourths of a yard how many inches would that be fractions whenever you have a fraction of a number what is that of telling you to
divide multiply multiply so what should you multiply if you want to know 3 fourths of a yard is how many inches 36 multiply what by 363 fourths by 36 come on that it s a fraction times a whole number i don t know how to do that
i don t know how to divide or times you should know how to multiply fractions yes you do take out your notes and find it cause it s there go back to your old notes and find multiplying fractions you guys need to finish this we don t have a whole lot of time left
fraction times a whole number is in your notes go back to your desk desk get your old math notes from toward the beginning of the year quarter but my old journal s at home well get your textbook also you re next
next we don t get number 6 and also we have a because i think we re doing a room the height of a room i think it would be inches but he thinks it s going to be in feet or kilometers well look at kilometers are like what
system i m coming you guys just make sure it s right
had so if you put 1000 of those a meter activity 1000 meters 1000 meters far so what in the customary system was far
notes no wonder we can t find it cause you got in here that odometer miles what are kilometers like miles miles so let s go back to what you were looking at
no so then would you measure your bedroom in kilometers right now most bedrooms are maybe just a tad bit smaller than this maybe they go to here okay inches there might be a better choice than that
feet that s what i said now let me check on my other group and then i ll come back remember fraction of a whole number okay what yards to inches so we need to know how many inches to get one yard then you can use that to figure out the rest
did can you tell me how you got 2 quarts of she needs to buy 9 cups of ice cream or 9 cups of cream to make ice cream 4 cups in all of what in one quart in one quart hold on because you re partner s not ready
she s going to miss something i m just trying to understand how we got 2 quarts because there s 4 cups in one quart okay 4 cups in one quart she needs to buy 9 cups of cream to make her ice cream buy me there s 4 cups to each quart right okay so if she buys 2 quarts how many cups would that be
8 she has to buy 3 okay don t get confused with questions like this because this doesn t ask you to exactly convert the exact number of cups in quarts and i think you were trying to get as close as possible if she s going to make this and she needs she needs at least 9 cups more yes cause you ll have like extra yeah but can you buy less one more yeah
because is she going to be able to make her ice cream with no she won t be able to make it because she doesn t have enough the only one i disagree with besides number one i want you guys to make sure you change it is number 6 number what are you converting here what inches inches to . yards okay so that would be .
how many . yards to inches how many yards in an inch how many inches in a yard how many inches are in one yard 12 36 okay so if there are 36 inches in one yard yard okay wait wait wait while i m here i want to look at the rest of them
i marked it so that you would know to come back to it okay look at 14 again how many centimeters are there in one meter 100 teacher so if you have 17 i m not sure that there s going to be 170 centimeters if you got 17 meters all right did you use your notes
right here on every problem did you use your notes or are they sitting on the desk open and we re just ignoring them okay i want to make sure you refer to them 11 which of the following would most likely be used to measure the length of a swimming pool like miles so do you want to measure your swimming pool in miles
meters i m just asking a simple question i m just trying to you you guys can look at the remaining choices and see which one makes the most sense okay all right neither one of you got your notes or your books to see how to multiply a fraction times a whole number
and i told you it was in your notebook and it s in your textbook guys you got to help yourself
we talked about kilometers kilometers are like something though what are kilometers like miles look at number 11 and see if that makes sense then 0 we didn t do that but you were suppose to double check it before you brought it to me i would like for you guys i would like for you to work with you re not giving them answers
answers right now they re trying to remember how to multiply a fraction times a whole number okay help i would like for you to help the group in front and
i m coming all right i ll have something to do for you in just one minute okay miss which ones are we going to look back over
4 and 7 i ll have something for you in just a minute okay i ll be there in just a moment me all eyes on you it s beginning to get a little loud
if i mark this by circling it or something like that i want you to go back and look at it that what answer are we choosing for number 4 c that so it looks like there s just 3 i have a concern about
markings not number 6 number 70 we crossed that out me all eyes on . most groups are having a reasonable noise level there s a couple of groups i m trying not to call out names
to okay to kilometers kilometers and kilometers are in the metric system
system wait kilometers . kilometers measure what capacity weight or length
now may i use your pencil my eraser broke off i would like you i don t need it to revisit number one i would like you to revisit . okay look at number 6
what yards to inches yards to inches so what do you need to know 1st how many inches are in how many inches are in one yard okay so if there are 36 in one yard and this it 3 fourths of a yard is 3 fourths more or less than one whole more or less less 3 fourths is it more or less less
less so that means 3 fourths of a yard has to be more or less than 36 inches less less so that eliminates 2 right there okay
did you use your notes my notes are at my house i grabbed the wrong notebook 0 boy
attention which one do you need help with 8 which one do you need help on know 12 divided by . how many inches are in feet and there are 12 inches in a foot very good so if there are 12 inches in one foot what are you re going to multiply
multiply what 12 times . 12 times 3 . 12 times . why 12 times 3 what no 3.5 why 3 and 5 tenths cause that s the number that you have you have 3 and 5 tenths feet and you need to multiply that by 12 3 but that would be 42
that would be 42 because you put the decimal right there yeah all right yes you are that but you don t want to listen to me
it all right everybody has paper it all right doing what are we doing today
build 3 d buildings out of cubes good and what also are we going to do once we build our 3 d buildings j from from perspectives perspectives good
so we are going to build 3 d buildings out of cubes and then we are going to address lots of those 3 d buildings from different perspectives is
see if i am drawing the silhouette of a building from different perspectives think about what we did this morning looking at our 3 d shapes
j different shapes not a different shape a different way a different way right okay so the 1st thing we are going to do i want everybody to look at their paper it says make the buildings i am going to get some cubes too
let us look at number one everybody make that building with your cubes
i do not want to hear talking though you have it right next to you too
how all right let us see what you have got counted you had 123 here and then if you count the same one you had 1234 you had one underneath right
from this side that is what we would see right body what do we see from the top shape what do you see from the top of your shape
right yes right here right here is our right angle right we see a right angle
sure let me it is an l right so each of these are different perspectives okay together make number 2 better yet make number 2 using number one
2 what is going on
else because these are not the same it is the same thing from a different what is the p word we just learned perspective perspective 0 interesting right hold your shape so that it looks like number one
a take 2 on this side yeah put one more to make 4 then add another one on the bottom all right so moved his cubes places what else could you have done to get number 2
it you can just turn it right amazing it is still the same shape but does not it look so much different wow that is what a different perspective is
hey it looks like except this is going the wrong way
shh me looks good make sure you count carefully
yours there you go good all right here is number 3 what do we see from the top of number 3 look at the top of your number 3 what do you see be more specific 3 i do not see a number 3 on the top of that
specific i am looking for a hand n a straight line you see a straight line of how many cubes i see a straight line of 3 cubes beautiful what if i look at it from the front front hold it like this so that it faces you and you can look at it
perspective what do you see from this perspective a right angle a right angle j 4 edges you see 4 edges mine one here
11 here and one here you mean together 1234566
s l upside down an l upside down good else all right look at number 4 what do you have to do to make number 4 change a cube you change a cube
s take the cube that was here take the cube that was there and what do i do take it off take it off and put it where on the e right on the right good job
or you can like this like if you went right here you could just go like that wait let me go back to the original so i can see what you mean all right a turn it like that like this 0 i turn the bottom one stuff we have got number 4 right
yes now what do you see from the front of number 4 a right angle sure else what do you see from the front of this one
see what does it kind of look like to you see right angle
see turn it to the side so that it is facing you so that it is facing you l i see dots you see dots from the cubes
i feel like turning i do not see anything turning do you see a z no we have got it in our brains that there is an l right because we know that this piece sticks out but do we see that when we look right from here
no what do you see from this perspective angle what do you see right here me squares
cubes cubes yeah was that a rectangle it is just a straight line it is just a straight line of cubes is not it which is funny because we know that this one is sticking out but from this perspective we can not really tell that there is one sticking out can we
here it looks like a chair if we are looking at it from the side but i am literally looking at it right here down you should be staying with us thank you
t that has 4 edges 4 edges okay it the smaller then the lower but do you see an l here
see 4 vertices 0 nice work 4 vertices 4 corners great we kind of see the same thing we just saw right line we know that this one is far away but it is just straight up and down right
good how about if we look at it like this you what do you see looking a chair what do you see
a chair do you see a chair though we are only looking right here just looking at this part right here
see i will come back to
amazing okay you are fixing it
good let us see number 5 let us make number 5 how can you make number 5 turn everything how did you make number 5 twist it
again did anybody else just take it apart so now what are some of the things you see me when i hold it this way i see what do you see
hands you should be looking at it from different perspectives you the so held it like this but you are holding on to this
it what do you see when you look at it that way
see a straight line
okay she flipped it and you faced she is holding it this way angle we understand that different shapes look different depending on how you look at them
it has right here she has 40 yeah she does just take one cube out not there in the middle here in this one the one that is going up
j looks like a duck looks like a duck yeah
over let us see you make number 6 you can take all the pieces out or you can make it with new ones whichever one you want
okay excuse me talk i did not ask you to talk
ms yeah is there a straight line on the other side you have to tell me
if i have to ask you to stop talking again i am going to have to take the cubes away from you interesting looking good good job
you should not be worrying about putting them all in to one straight line you need to build this shape which does not involve putting them all back together
all right everybody hold your shape like this facing you so that you see this see what do you see j looks like a little house without a roof like a little house without a roof
front let us see if you can tell me what it looks like from the right one what does it look like from the right
if this is the front i want you guys to think about which way is the right right come point to the right that you are looking at
me it is okay t so the 1st thing is to decide what is right
right that is the right so this part is the right left izquierda y derecha right derecha derecha okay
right what do you see job how about from the back so i am going to say it one more time
playing what do you see from the back what do you see from the back right what have you already called this part ladies and gentlemen front look at it from the back what do you see from the back
square sure yeah a square missing what j looks like a right angle just one right angle yeah what else do you see
what can you see from the back that you could not see from the front
try what do you see when you look at the back j comprende la pregunta
l an l job what can you see from the back that you could not see from the front no but from the back it is right there right
s stop worrying about your cubes being in straight lines and get your shapes made okay
hold it the way it is showing you once you are done making it
us hold it the way it shows us in the picture what is right you tell me picture yes good
you have 123123 good and 2 you have 2 there one there where does this guy go though
it done try sticking it in to this one instead it is at the same place but stick it in to this hole instead does that look a little bit better maybe
right we are looking at our shape holding it the same way we are holding it the same way as our picture
hello what are we holding
it what do you see from the front what do you see
71 it is is turn 234566 are you counting this one also aqui tambien
okay so from the front we can not see it right right we see 7 okay what else do you see from the front what do you see from the front see here is one here is one here is one
nice job 123456 good job right all right turn it to the left side the left side here we had front and this was the right
left you need to sit up the right way picture there is not very much to be saying i do not get it about this one so turn it to the left yes this is what i am seeing if i turn it to the left
left let me see it one more time from you you need to look at the picture and match yours to the picture you can not just say i do not get it we are basically playing we have talked about the party and the sitting and doing nothing so if you want to sit and do nothing you will have to go to the office to do it right
blocks i started you out with 1231231212 go what do you see when you look at it from the left see i am holding it this way
what with okay this one is tripping people up so here is what we are going to do let us real quick make sure we all have the right one we have made it the right way
i am going to start from the beginning so everybody is looking up here so that we can figure out how to make these what i am going to count what need 1234567 okay
i only get 71234567 there is my 7 right then i am going to start at one side to make it easier okay
need 33123 stop talking please this if you were confused as to what you were doing you should be doing this with me picture how many do i attach here
here 2 right here top then what do i do if i go down to this one do add 2 i add 2 to the middle one okay
put 2 together i am going to put it right in to the middle one far good how am i doing so far good good right
go on the other side right there we go shape you can see from the back it looks just like the picture right
now then i said i am going to take my shape i looked at it from the front like this and now i want to turn it to the left left i take it and i turn it so that i see the left side did yes all right so you should be holding your shape in your hand and having it face you to the left
good now tell me what do you see from the left when you look at your building from the left what do you see see it kind of looks like a camera huh 0 it looks like a camera
see what do you see yours that is the problem dear you are playing you keep taking it apart and you can not remember how it goes back together so here
see just look at mine what kind of design are the cubes making or shape see you can not say i do not know to that look at it
see what is this it it is not going to be an i do not know
see you can not be wrong and you can not not know because i know you can see it see what are these cubes in formation
square is this a square it a straight line a straight line with a cube yeah with one added on top of it right hard i do not think so
right we had a deal that we were not going to be doing this anymore j what do you see from the left l yeah this makes it look a little bit like an l especially if i flipped it upside down right
good how about we go back to the front sit up please what do you see from the right
squares yes we know we see cubes and squares but what shape do the cubes and squares make
sure what else do you see from the right right an l l what do you see a right angle a right angle time now we have to practice what is the 2nd objective that we have
closest did we build 3 d buildings out of cubes check we can check it right off what do we need to do now word sil silhouette silhouette of 3 d
from from different per perspectives yes from different perspectives
f now we need to draw some silhouettes from different perspectives okay these are the buildings we just made
ago what it asked you to draw the silhouettes you are going to draw the silhouette from the front from the top and from the right and if you look up here it reminds you what the front is what the top is and where the right is so i do not want anybody saying i did not know what to draw it is right there for you okay
yeah look at building number one
that i see 123 boxes over and one box down in everybody see that
okay from the top what do we see from the top 63 over 123 and how many up 4123477 all together
l i am going to go back to the beginning so i know where to start from 22 going down and how many going across
441234 and i am going to color it in this i want everybody to draw by themselves if you want to make each building you can that is why you still have the cubes or you can just make the pictures and try to figure it out
you go ahead and get started
work okay
work draw a line draw a line and then color it in you do not need to make the 1st one because we already did it up there so now copy that and go on to the 2nd one
i need another pencil why is another pencil sense is this one yours where is yours where is all the stuff that you just got from ms week how are all your pencils and leads gone i forgot my lead at my house because my mom put it somewhere borrow somebody else is pencil okay
this mine why are your initials off of it already difficult that was not number 7 i do not know what to tell you
is the lead i gave you
square why do not you try making this bigger i see that okay now wait wait wait
go on to the back let us check this the right side
shape for homework you are going to finish this my voice is on so i should see all eyes up here
for homework you are going to finish this paper then we have got something that is very simple this one just asks how many cubes does it take to build this easy you do not have to draw anything you just have to say how many cubes it takes
this one you are matching the silhouette with front right left or back of this building over here and and don t say tomorrow that i didn t know what to do with my homework really easy
me eyes on the elmo screen for a minute you need to give me about less than 5 minutes of your attention and then you ll be doing an activity with the blocks right but give me your attention up on the screen for 5 minutes and then it ll be your time to work with the blocks and do an activity
if you look on your page i want to just be on the definition side 1st and then this is your side for the activities it s a real simple fun lesson that we re going to just kind of be working with the pattern blocks and if we re working with the pattern blocks what that does is it just makes us more familiar with the different shapes
right so everyone has their bag of pattern blocks let s do on the definition page let s kind of do some classroom quick definitions definition it doesn t have to be like a dictionary definition what s your definition of or let s come up with it together a classroom definition of a square
a 4 equal sides definitely 4 equal sides 4 what are some other math vocabulary words that we can get into our definition it s an equilateral no you re thinking of triangles when we talk about equilateral right let s do i m thinking of a word that begins it s a closed figure p 0 is it a polygon polygon
how about a 4 sided polygon angles 4 right angles 4 right angles is it s just a special kind of correct it s a quadrilateral it s a special kind of rectangle it s a rectangle that has all 4 sides the same length
yeah so it is also a quadrilateral polygon so there s a lot of different math vocabulary words let s call a square a rectangle with 4 equal sides
a rectangle with 4 equal sides and then obviously it has 4 right angles
be and 4 right angles parallelogram which one is the parallelogram
parallelogram i should see this one up blue blue let s come up with a definition of a parallelogram how many pairs listen to the words i use how many pairs of parallel sides are in this blue parallelogram pairs of parallel sides
2 i have this side is parallel to this side definition what s the definition of a parallelogram and this is a special this blue one is a special kind of parallelogram yet 2 hands that s it there s only 2 people that are willing to take a chance on the definition of a parallelogram
j it s just like a square but sideways a square that s sideways i understand what you re saying but that s not good math vocabulary a it s like 2 triangles stuck together yeah but we want to talk about i understanding what you re saying but yes could i put my 2 triangles on top
parallelogram i don t want to know that it s 2 triangles w symmetrical how about this
polygon it s a 4 sided polygon with each pair of opposite sides what
word each pair of opposite sides so this side to this side and this side to this side j opposite sides parallel okay a 4 sided polygon with each pair of opposite sides parallel
now this is a special parallelogram because all 4 sides are of equal length and a special one with 4 equal sides in length is called a rhombus the blue one that we re working with today is a rhombus it s a special kind of parallelogram just like a square is a special kind of rectangle
right get the definition down and then go into your bag and get out the trapezoid please thumbs up or thumbs down a trapezoid is a quadrilateral thumbs up or thumbs down on that
i should see all thumbs up here let s come up with a classroom definition so why don t we say it s a quadrilateral having how many pairs of parallel sides block 211 only one pair this time right
cause look at these 2 sides right this left and this right side are not parallel but the top is parallel to the bottom so it s a quadrilateral wait how is this top parallel to the bottom that top right there is not parallel to that
touch if i continue that line forever i continue that line forever they re not going to touch down careful on the spelling of quadrilateral
spell i can make that bigger along i m just kind of stacking mine
out now this triangle this isn t just any ordinary triangle triangle that means all angles all 3 angles all 3 sides same but let s just make a definition for any triangle right 3 sides all right
sides how about a 3 sided polygon with 3 angles does anybody kind of a bonus question here know the largest angle that you could have inside of a triangle
what s the largest angle that you could have inside a triangle up obtuse could i have an obtuse actually i could i could i actually could couldn t i you could because look it if i draw it on a piece of hold on let me get you could have an obtuse angle
watch cause that angle right there that s an obtuse angle right here yeah and then these 2 angles would be acute and acute this if i add up the 3 angles in a triangle it should always equal what know wait if i add this angle to this angle to this it doesn t matter what the triangle looks like
even if this is a right triangle right here we know that s 90 degrees 2 but if i add up the 3 angles it always comes to the same number in a triangle know if you add up the 3 any 3 angles in a triangle add them altogether equals 180
0 that s and our last pattern block out hexagon hexagon so what s a hexagon then hexagon it has 6 sides 6 sides so that has to be in our definition
else well let s not use the word shape i think it would be better if we used the word polygon polygon how about we just say a polygon with 6 sides and 6 angles is the top and the bottom parallel to each other good question just said is the top side of this hexagon parallel to the yes
bottom all the opposite sides are parallel
this so in this particular hexagon there are opposite faces parallel but it s not always the case a polygon with 6 sides and 6 angles what okay
get those definitions down and then we get to do kind of the activity bit i know that when you have your definitions down i should see you flip the paper i m going to move these over and i should see you flip over to this side
okay shh just preview it for a 2nd while people are finishing up do the reading part to yourself quietly for a 2nd i ll flip back
go 0 i ll blow it up just a little bit so you can see it in the back just i didn t say play with the pattern blocks i said do the reading part you re going to have an opportunity to work with the blocks are you all set now
okay this is kind of a little mix between math and art also okay it says pattern block picture
patty parallelogram so i guess that would be the blue one is a member of the pattern block family everyone in her family is expected to attend the pattern block school of art other family members at the school are trevor trapezoid that s the red guy right
green hector hexagon who s that square orange orange it sounded like a name the name it s the same thing as what the name of the 0 yeah
pattern whatever the name is starts with the same letter of the name of the shape 0 trevor trapezoid trixie triangle hector hexagon sammy square patty parallelogram do patty wants her next piece of artwork to include the shapes of her family members here s your activity
use the pattern blocks that you guys have and the guidelines follow you can t just go do anything down there rules to help patty create her design it can be imaginary or realistic
arrange the blocks to your satisfaction inside the frame below so step one arrange the blocks following these rules inside the frame step 2 trace around each block and color it details then write a title for your design where it says title
so you guys have altogether you have how many pattern blocks 1010 yeah and you have these rules to follow you can talk to your neighbor let s just go over the rules quickly and then i m going to set you guys loose okay make sure your picture includes read the 1st bullet there at least 2 of each different polygon so that means you re going to have to use all 10 of them right
if you have to use 2 of each that s how many you have 2 of each so that rule just means basically use every block you have m the side of a square touching the side of a hexagon okay so if i have a square somewhere in my design i have to have the side of the square touching 0 can you guys see that
the side of a square has to be touching the side of a hexagon 0 rule number 32 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon you guys figure that one out on your own i m not going to tell you that one but it s pretty self explanatory rule number 4 rule number 4
one 2 3 this 12 parallelograms that are touching 2 parallelograms must be touching touch and the last rule is what one trapezoid directly above okay
one trapezoid all right let me get my trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares know this is the part where you guys have to kind of do you know moving them around playing with them
no as long as you re following these rules there should be many different designs then when you think it s perfect have your friend check it for you do yeah i would before we get going had a good question
he said do you think i should color if i trace it do you think i should color it the same color that it already is so like color your squares orange your trapezoids red your hexagons you know what i mean here are we supposed to make a shape of yeah
j yeah but then once it s made you trace and color 0 light on please for this part around obviously all the pieces are going to have to be flat on the paper right
it yeah now you got to get it onto the paper inside the frame right here 0
something one trapezoid directly above so you re going to have to spin this so the trapezoid is above the squares like this right the trapezoid has to be above the squares 2 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon 2 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon
yeah and you have to what is it here go down the bulleted rules and make sure you followed them all
the last so you used all of them that 2 trapezoids combine to make one hexagon that 2 parallelograms are touching you did that one trapezoid is directly above one trapezoid is directly above and touching 2 connected squares
done how about if we move you re going to have to kind of do some rearranging there away when you think you have done it and followed all the rules you can raise your hands up if i give you the thumbs up then you start doing your tracing and coloring
shapes the side of the square is touching the side of a hexagon yes yes 2 parallelograms touching yes one trapezoid directly above where s his triangle one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
it s not really above but how could you make it more in the above that giant parallelogram you think you ve done it
see harder you used all of them the side of the square is touching the side of a hexagon it one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares you did it
back i think i did it a i got all of them and put in all right hold on all the side of a square is touching the side of a hexagon right there 2 trapezoids combined to make a hexagon right there 2 parallelograms touching huh one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
right i like it all can we just shift it a little bit more like this way that s colored if you have to you can kind of
it 0 easy the side of a square is touching the side of a hexagon 2 trapezoids combined 2 parallelograms touching one trapezoid directly you didn t do the last step one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
you have the squares above the if you can somehow spin that yeah rule make sure these guys are actually touching right huh i guess they are touching there it looks good okay connected it said 2 connected squares
connected i could tell real quick because i ve been looking at everybody else s rule one trapezoid directly 0 on 0
it there there you go 2 trapezoids combined is yeah 2 parallelograms are touching well make sure they re actually touching touching one trapezoid directly above that s definitely not happening one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
happening well see the squares actually have to be connected somehow and they have to be below the trapezoid so keep working on it 0 check the last rule a okay you think you re all set yeah the side of a square is touching the side of a hexagon point to where that is
the side of a square is touching a hexagon yeah yeah right there huh this is a trapezoid 2 trapezoids combined where s that correct one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected yeah you re all set now the hard part is get it traced and colored okay ooh i like that one
i haven t seen that one yet and it looks like you ve done everything you re supposed to do hexagon 2 trapezoids combined how do you trace this i like that everything it s so hard one trapezoid 0 wait a minute yeah you did it it yeah can you do what
make our own shape i don t understand the question like once we re done when you check it and you say we can do it you mean like trace and make our own shape yeah but it has to be what you just showed me j we re not going to just all of a sudden make something different challenge try to trace what you just showed me
all right show me where with your finger the side of a square is touching the side of a hexagon yeah 2 trapezoids connected to make a hexagon right correct correct one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares yeah that s good right so now the trick is get it in there get it traced get it colored
anybody else ready to get checked
all right i know i can see a mistake so i m just going to say things and then you point all right you used all the pieces obviously the side of a square is touching the side of a hexagon right here the side of a square is touching the and right there too huh this 12 trapezoids combined right there 2 parallelograms touching
now this is the part one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares so we have to get these red ones above somehow or another i don t know if you just do this maybe you do i m not sure you have to get these guys under like this last rule
it everything was good until you got to this part so concentrate on that part touching the side of square is touching so maybe can you move this know you got to kind of start from check all the rules again 0 you there s a problem here
here 2 trapezoids need to be connected that s correct trapezoids well right here rule number 3 says 2 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon it aren t you going up here and looking at these before you raised your hand and called me over cause there s another problem too
here 2 parallelograms where are your parallelograms these 2 guys a what i want you to check s if you have a question about it call me over p can you do this can you go up on the elmo and make that shape that you did cause i liked it
far while you guys are working at your seats is going to make the shape that she did on the elmo screen i think all your rules are good here shapes where s the side of a square touching the side of a hexagon
see it s got to kind of be touching it like that but then that s going to make something else wrong okay one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
this and then 0 you can basically put the triangles anywhere want now the trick is you got to trace it color it
you got to get it to fit inside the frame one it s kind of like with the one i saw do but a little different it looks like a bird yeah look up on the screen
0 that s is anybody feel like they re having a difficult time following all the rules this huh i just saw another one kind of like this but she changed it just a little bit watch i m going to change it just a touch
watch cause there s a couple tricks here rule number 4 says the 2 parallelograms are touching so you re 2 blues they have to be touching touching actually your 2 squares your orange squares have to be touching why one of the rules says why these 2 squares have to touch
a one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares 2 connected squares all right connected what s the deal with the 2 red trapezoids why they have to be like this connected why
a because 2 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon 2 trapezoids combine to make a hexagon that my 2 parallelograms are connected touching watch at least 2 of i ve used all the shapes
here now watch what did and i thought it made it it sort of looks like a eagle or a bird she just moved your triangles you can pretty much put anywhere cause it doesn t seem like any of the rules are worrying about the triangles so she just moved her triangles down here and i thought it made it look a little bit more like a bird yes well yours can be a bird that s standing on a branch and this could be a bird that s flying
i made a you made a different kind of bird yeah i found okay did we check this one for yeah but all right i didn t this is good do you have to sort of trace and draw it color it
and so it needs to be upside down 0 what happened you kind of yeah did it wrong but you just fixed it by doing it like this yeah i see a problem
the blue ones parallelograms are they touching they re touching
again these are connected touching the trapezoids are above the squares and the square is touching the side of a hexagon touch however those are touching yeah the blues are touching
this this is like this and the trapezoids are above the connected orange squares set yeah i know but that looks like it could be a what yeah i know it could be anything a train if that s the thing the smoke come out of on a train i don t know yeah this one problem
rule okay one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares what maybe we can change the whole thing if we just move these 2 works and that it kind of looks like a i don t know what it looks like what s it look like a bug a caterpillar it looks like a tank let me see
you used all your pieces that right there 02 trapezoids combined to make a hexagon that this 2 parallelograms touching one trapezoid directly above that s good
that this do you think you can remember how to make that on the elmo screen like sort of like some kind of an insect or an animal or something it kind of looks like a tank he s going to go up to the elmo see no there s already blocks up there so you just leave this here and sort of come back here and look at it if you need to
yellows to the orange how did he do that this he had you have the 2 oranges connected the 2 yellows connected the 2 trapezoids above the oranges feet and then you used the green triangles for like ears they re next to each other next to each other on top
it looks like a tank or something that s pretty cool yeah a tank that s pretty cool i don t see the tank 0 the blue part looks like the blue part is the tracks was a tank all right rule huh one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares
you got them connected but these trapezoids have to be above then we can move the let s see what happens if we do this now maybe you can drop him down here that s good i think that might work
it yeah rules yes that s kind of cool what it looks like a it looks like a moon rover
okay you should be at this point tracing and coloring cool it looks like a drag race kind of it looks like a drag car fits yeah yeah yeah i like that one
it s kind of similar to the one up there but you moved some of the things around there did another one that s a little different looking something sweet yeah
s 0 i okay it s not finished until i see a title and a name and try to get these colored in a little nicer whoa that just all right we need to start tracing and coloring now
title all right i got a problem here one trapezoid directly above and touching 2 connected squares squares your squares have to be touching and they have to be below these 2 red guys
there now you can do this here touch now you could do your triangles put your triangles
anywhere yeah did you get your picture taken yeah a lot of people down there yeah that has no title and it has no name on it
title maybe we ll have a prize for the best piece of artwork that means the best coloring the straightest lines and the best title and your name has to be on it idea he said can i decorate the background if i have everything else done
absolutely yeah i like that now you got to trace it and draw it and color it and give it a cause someone 0 yeah
arms yeah okay no markers all right you get coloring or were you thinking of a title
yeah what you re still working you haven t been able to get it or you just changed your mind and come up with some different ones i changed okay i think you re good
connected i think you need to have yeah as long as you have the orange above the red trapezoid triangles can go anywhere it these actually you should you can move this over here
see because you have to have this square has to be touching the side of one of those hexagons this it s weird to how to keep these all without moving huh move exactly these are supposed to be sort of touching somehow
you re kind of going off the this can go anywhere actually i guess you could put it here too here i don t know you can put it anywhere all right coloring if you are not drawing and coloring you re behind
it that has to be on we re not going to start playing stack the blocks until i see that there s a title here and a name here bag let s see title okay have you done a round of fastt math today
good go on the back computer and do a round of fastt math how do you spell cyborg cyborg yeah that s a good one y yeah just how it sounds pretty much and then borg b 0 r what s the last sound
it know what to do well that s up to you i mean well like this okay so it s not really looking like anything so you could just call it pattern block design is i have to go to my what time
10 45 really there leave the room quietly please what about this one how about just what are you trying to think of something more creative than pattern block design
well you could just call it even that pattern block picture yes have you done a round of fastt math this morning here up on this computer over here to the left
i was about to call it the thingamajig because i didn t know what it was called the thing i m not sure i don t know how you spell thingamajig
sounds thingamajig yeah so a thingamajig can i use this for a minute no i don t know so i would triangles are green no
frame it kind of makes it like pop out nice you can do the same if you want like color it like a sharp color see so it looks like it s matted nice don t be afraid what don t what does it say it has to be turned over 00000 what he knew that he sort of had made a little mistake but he wasn t going to redo the whole thing
see right there if you hold his this way what s wrong with it squares they re supposed to be like this way no correct so he said don t be afraid turn it over
if you turn it over the trapezoid is now what squares if you hold it the other way there s a little bit of a mistake
it doesn t really follow the rules will also be a all right you can be a helper
if you are completely finished make sure all 10 of the pattern blocks end up back in the ziploc bag and close it up
around cool here can you bag those for me
yeah still nothing yeah still thinking on it
computer okay so what was the purpose of the lesson lesson yeah it was fun but why do you think we did it
it learn shapes to become more familiar hopefully we re pretty familiar already but to become more familiar with the shapes it s also a good following directions lesson which we need some good practice of that too
okay okay all right we are shifting focus we have finished with fractions and decimals and we are going to be moving on to geometry so i want you to tell me when you hear the word geometry what does what does that mean to you
so tell me what you know from geometry from previous years so i know what i m starting with here z well geometry when i think of it it s like shapes and how to measure okay shapes and measuring them area and perimeter okay which we talked a little bit about last week with what
what were those things called guys okay so that gives me an idea with all right we re going to do a little activity today related to shapes so our 1st thing on our list
so in front of you at your table should be some purple squares and you are going to be using those purple squares wait don t touch them yet touch just resist the magnetism for a moment you are going to be cutting them into triangles so in order to do that where did i put my pile
go in order to cut them into triangles you are just going to fold them and cut so let me get and will you pass out the scissors please so you re just going to fold and it may not be perfect paper cutters are rarely perfect me being the paper cutter this time
triangles so i want you to and there s probably going to be extra but 5 per person 5 per person and make triangles okay so divide up 5 per person and make triangles half and they don t have to be perfect
can okay 5 so while you re waiting for scissors you can fold and cut so fold and just cut along your fold to make triangles
corner just hold on to the extras right now later just hold on to the extras you might need them later and they might not be perfect just fold and cut corner to corner fold and cut corner to corner
0 i should see folding and cutting going on not so much talking cutting so you re cutting them corner to corner
fold it corner to corner and then cut it and once you re finished see if you can help those around you to get their 5 done
there s a pile still in the middle i think of extras
i is not here yes okay so if you re finished help your friends around you if they need it
who s is that is that yours is this yours if you can cut through that many at once go for it you all s scissors are a little less sharp than mine so it might be harder to cut through several sheets of paper
i get the special scissors cause i m special er it s all about you that s right i m glad you ve learned finally right when we were doing biography reports she was like that s right
all right do we have any friends who still need a little help to get finished excellent okay right now you just need 2 triangles
2 for this exact moment you just need 2 take 2 triangles please and make a square did i say to make a square suddenly some of us have forgotten i want you to make as many possible different shapes as you can
something just like with the pentominoes you cannot fit side to side like this remember with the pentominoes how did they have to fit together all like all the side corners to corners corner to corner so the whole side had to fit together so i want you fitting them corner to corner like that
2 so i m going to take 2 and i m going to make a shape and i m going to set those aside and i m going to take another 2 and i m going to make a shape and i m going to set it aside i want to see how many shapes how many different shapes i can make using 2 just 2 how many different shapes can i make using just 2
2 triangles per shape remember they have to fit together corner to corner which means i can t use short side long side together do you have a question yeah since they re already triangles could you just make them into bigger triangles if that s a shape
shape well i was just thinking cause it s the same shape maybe and remember each shape has to be different than the others which means it has to look different than the others no you can t do that side can we do another triangle i don t know is that a shape
can we have one going down and one going up thing they have to look completely different as in different size perimeter different maybe different perimeter i don t know
out how many shapes did you come up with 5555
most okay tell me i ve got my 2 triangles together tell me one way i can put them together you can make a star by turning them facing the longest long end to long end
this mine get pretty green dots way you can do like short end to short end like this so one is upside down and one s right side up
okay all right k i put the these 2 sides together to make it look like this okay short end to short end
3 do i have another one on yeah you do it so it s like you do like that yeah yeah is that different
different it looks the same though is it okay so if i go like yeah that way yeah that no turn it yeah right there like that is it well it s the same shape is it the same no but if you tilt it if you tilt it up like this it could be a different one
different yes is it a different shape not has the same number of sides and the same general pattern different i can see how it looks a little different to make but the sides are the same way together but it was a good try
with you put this like right there to kind of make a star it s got to be side to side c and when you make the diamond if you turn it it s a square so like this again
no so once again if i turn it a little bit so there s only 3 so how many different shapes can you make 33 cause i can turn these any number of ways but does it change the shape of them
them so 3 is the most you can make with 2 triangles called what are these shapes called anybody know one we can we can kind of start to qualify a little bit our shapes
called does anybody know the technical name for it know a geometric shape a specific geometric shape that we re looking for teacher would know
c a rhombus a rhombus actually it s just a square yeah can maybe a square be a rhombus yeah no we might have to investigate that later on i know that s an eyebrow raiser
okay so so we said another name for this one is just a square triangle cause it has 3 sides cause it has 3 sides and 3 angles angle triangle okay what about this one
know it actually has several names y it goes to a square but it isn t the same as a quadrilateral quadrilateral and a square is a quadrilateral i ve got a question parallel shapes we might have to do a little investigating what a quadrilateral is
here i m sorry it s hard for me to understand you when you call out a parallelogram a parallelogram you think it s a parallelogram parallelogram okay so maybe we ll talk about what a parallelogram is
okay so i m going to challenge you and i see some of you playing with your shapes so let s not do that for the moment please i am going to challenge you to now instead of 2 triangles i want to see how many shapes you can make using 40 wait a minute i m not done talking i want to see how many shapes you can make using 4 triangles
wait i know it s so exciting to investigate but we have to be patient so we only cut 5 squares in half and we don t want to spend all day cutting so i m going to have you work with a nearby neighbor on this one so that you can combine your shapes together
just like with the 2 each shape you make has to be different shape just like we couldn t make this this way and this this way and call it 2 different shapes that doesn t work this time either sense so this is only one shape no matter how i turn it and the same goes for your 4s
so what you might want to do right now is anything that s on your desk put it on the floor so it s out of the way so you have plenty of room for your shapes
fantastic fantastic fantastic that is how one of my old high school professors used to wake up people who fell asleep our social studies book was about this thick and so any time someone started to doze off in class he d walk by their desk and cement floors not carpet and he d drop it
yeah okay side story totally unrelated but so you re working with the person sitting next to you making as many shapes out of 4 as you can
now since we ve got 3 over here you re going to work with so you can grab yours and come sit up next to and you are going to come up well actually you know what i m going to send you back to work with and you guys can sit at the back table okay that way you guys have some room correct yeah so with your partner as many shapes with 4 as you can make
squares you should have some extra squares at your table it has to be side to side just like before side don t cut any more until you ve made everything that you can
you have to use 4 for each shape each shape has to have 4 no less than 4 i m coming this v one
one only 4 no more than 4 no less than 4 is this one
sure no more than 4 no less than 4 do 3 d shapes count do what 3 d shapes no no 3 d
flat is this one is it does it have 4 it i think i need to cut some more paper
i have one of my shapes pyramid don t take them apart remember you don t take them apart sorry i forgot that
up my rain boots
cry i am prone to getting hurt i what are you doing i m trying to find there s more at your table can different you can just take one shape and change it
we re going to get like 50
coming maybe you could work together as a foursome if you re running out and can t make enough what s a foursome your whole table a group of 4 i know i feel like i m going to get bitten if i m not careful
sharing do i need to have a sign in day are we doing what we re supposed to be doing cause it looked like you were playing in your desk
together ladies that s enough you can if you but you don t have to
it s too confusing i need this many here we re going to need a lot more squares we have a gift
it s like we re going to need a lot more squares a lot more and a lot and a lot bigger tables we re still going
i know
finished i know that you didn t get a chance to do all of them but i see so many around the room and we re running out of purple squares many so let s talk about some of the shapes that we have come up with seat you can join us
you can sit back near where your creations are however let s have a seat so we re going to use 4 squares or i m sorry 4 triangles shapes teacher yes i need okay thank you get your assignment book so let s see let s see what we can make
now i might have to borrow some of yours because i don t have as many triangles as you guys have so and i don t have that many magnets so we might have to borrow and scrounge and figure out here
okay so tell me give me a shape that you came up with using 4 triangles
4 are short sides touching long sides touching like this okay so my 4 short sides touching in the middle or 4 sets of short sides touching in the middle okay square let s see if i can get it to stick using one magnet the middle that s what i was hoping
hey i doubt many will cooperate that well n it s kind of like these 2 okay so i m going to start with a triangle facing upward or downward
that and then you put the okay then you put like that yeah okay let s see of it doesn t have to be a shape it doesn t okay just we ll talk about what shapes they are
patient as long as it s different from the others we re good so far okay let s keep going give me another example
you put like a square at the top okay
and you put the 2 and then you put one under that like this okay and then this one is touching the other side short side like that like this
u it s like a square like this okay we ll start with a square okay and then you put a square a triangle okay and then okay
so square and then kind of like bunny ears like that sort of looks like a puppy dog so you end up with a triangle turned shape okay your shape keeps changing i can t keep up
it was like this okay all right so i start with a diamond shh i don t need commentary and one goes up and one goes like that
okay okay i shouldn t have put that 0 we re going to trust we re going to be testing teacher s stretching skills today
451 pick one
okay pick a triangle make it like okay take 2 back to back okay where does it go
yeah like that what he said the other one and make it like this okay
okay all right anybody else have extra triangles i can yeah okay you re all so nice to donate okay all right give me one take 2 triangles make them a small square okay
all right and take one triangle like this and then put another one there on top of it
okay so like that just turn the thing yeah like that
different let s be 4th graders not 4 year olds please okay so we re going to make that shape that we had before with the opposites quadrilateral okay
together so it s kind of like you re doing alternating triangles okay all right let s see 0 i ve got to get yours pulled out
all right what i want you to do is if you have any of these 123456789 eliminate them from your pile and see what s left while i get ready to go all right so we ve got your 40 minutes of reading response and then remember remember what we talked about you re supposed to think about for your reading tonight
that reputation is on his way yeah he s coming you re supposed to think about your reputation and then that would be it for tonight okay awhile so even if it s turned differently eliminate it if it s the same time if it s the same shape it s out yes if it s the same shape it s out
me okay i think we re good what s i think this pile is plenty we have 2 left what do we do with these just hold on to them just hold on to whatever you ve got okay if it s the same shape eliminate it
so i only want shapes that are different than what we ve already got up here i have a question is this you can t do long side to short side this one is on this side can they do this on this side nope that s the same thing over okay have a seat we ll figure it out have a seat have a seat have a seat okay so think about it i ll wait
still waiting still waiting if it is flipped over it s the same shape if it s spun around it s the same shape if it s built differently if it s completely different then it s a different shape but if it s just if it looks like this except this is flipped over it s on the other side it s the same shape
if it s built the same way just opposite excuse me i need to go okay thank you it s just one of those days for everybody going all right you don t need to bring me any more triangles triangles i think that i have enough all right we need to do this quickly all you ve got for homework tonight is the reading stuff okay so get that ready to go
all right let s do this quickly so voices are off cause it s about time to go shapes let s see what we have that s completely different 100% different
so i see this one right here that we ve got a square and then i need it s kind of like a rabbit or shh i should not hear you much all right
okay so we re starting this way one is that the way it was
okay so if you have that one then you can take it out of your pile
here so we ve got this one but it ends differently except i m going to built it upside down because it s the same thing
pile i m going to look around and see what i see and get those ones built cause i m running out of magnets okay so let s see
that is basically that one which is that in a different that one s 0 okay
one eek my fingers don t want to cooperate with this in a different spot
okay that s the same well no cause this is in a different spot okay we are completely out of time like 100% out of time so let s see how many we ve got so far and what i m going to try and do is leave these up till math tomorrow and then we can see if there are any to add
off so i need a nice neat stack of purple triangles nice neat stack of purple triangles and scissors given to stack them up at your table please it s okay
film this is the 1st time all right shhh good thing you re all done that s it you i ll be back in an hour now do i hit the start button it s already going 0 it s already going okay when you re done don t touch it what time will you be done it s about 50 minutes
okay i ll be back so if you want to come back in 45 to check in maybe okay boys and girls yesterday we started talking about fractions
in and looking at the fraction card we could see that we started with eighths sixths fourths thirds and then halves and then one fractions that equal parts of a whole whole when you talk about adding halves how many halves make a whole whole how many fourths would it take to make one half
242 of these fourths would be equal to a half so i can compare that half to these 2 fourths and these are equal what s another word for equal fractions equivalent all right so these are called equivalent fractions
fractions for them to really be fractions have to all be the same size parts so if this is a pizza and we re going to cut this pizza into fourths we have to make sure that every size is equivalent to one another equal to one another whole today s math lesson is continuing what we started yesterday discussing fractions equal parts to a whole
paper and if you want to take a look at this paper it has a boat on it and the title is sailing along with fractions what we re going to do today is we re going to take this boat and we re going to move this boat across a map from this starting point to this ending point this finish point
problems each of these pictures shows either a fraction or not a fraction so for this 1st square right here we re going to talk about is this a fraction raise your hand if you can tell me if this picture shows a fraction r it is because i see 2 equal halves all right so you re saying yes each part of this is equal to one another each of these pictures either has a name or it doesn t have a name
so said in this box that this is a fraction if yes it has a name boat we re going to write the name down below and we re going to shade in a part that goes with it so which word would you take out of the word list and put with that picture halves halves all right so right here halves this is a picture divided into halves
paper and then i want you to take the picture and i want you to shade in one half example help keep the sailboat on the right course
no if yes you re going to decide what kind of a fraction is it halves fifths fifths thirds thirds eighths eighths fourths ninths all right now if the picture does not show a fraction we don t have to do anything to it
fractions so i want you to work across the rows and then after you go across all 3 rows and i m going to come around if you need help you re going to raise your hand i m going to look to see how we re working map so after you see a map you can take and you can put your pencil right here and you can trace across the map and you ll go from the start to the finish
hand if i m already answering somebody s question you could ask a partner or somebody right next to you okay out see if you can create this map and we ll see if we can put this boat on the right course yes so if it s not a fraction we if it s not a fraction we re going to leave it alone square on to the next square yes so if you started in that can we shade in someone else yes
if you see a picture that shows a fraction shade in one part of the picture 00 by the way another thing use pencil only when you do the shading cause if you use anything other than pencil you won t be able to erase it
yes can i have a band aid for my finger it got cut is it bleeding it s kind of and it really hurts here you go
so when you look at this picture right here when you shade this in are these all equal pieces pieces yes it means you shade and you label picture thank you you re welcome you just answered my question remember yesterday the cookie problem i illustrated with the 2 kids cookie if it s not a fraction it won t be equal not equal parts
fair so you need to look at the picture carefully picture are these all equivalent pieces as you re going across you need to look right huh and i ate this much pizza are these the same amounts
no if yes all pieces are the same it s a fraction fraction 0 okay i did a mistake so i m going to erase to show you the lines right here
solve on this paper right here these are all fact families they it says that if it s a fact family you re going to write it on the suitcase that matches the line numbers fact family you fill in the 4 number sentences
circle so you can work on this next okay can you sharpen my pencil sure okay i see most people are working on the sailing along with fractions activity
if you finish before the 10 minutes are over you can go onto the next activity which is fact families top if you need help i ll come to you just raise your hand and that is the 2nd activity but you re going to go right into that 2nd activity once you ve finished sailing along with fractions when the 10 minutes are up we re going to discuss the solution to this paper
question okay numbers on the top of the paper they tell you to make a fact family so some of these can make a fact family and some of these cannot if you can make a fact family out of these numbers you re going to write it on the suitcase but if these numbers can t be used to make a fact family you re going to circle the set
so for each of the letters a b c you re going to fill in the suitcase unless you can t make a fact family yes so if you can t make one what do you do just it says here that you circle the fact family circle the set it all right these are looking good
shaded i m looking at labels if you shaded something in and you re telling me that it s a fraction it has equal parts now you go on to the 2nd paper which is fact families
it i don t get i don t can you help me with this on this paper right here it says you re going to read the set of numbers numbers huh this is set a using these numbers if you can create a fact family huh you fill it in on the suitcase it s not if you cannot make a fact family you re going to circle the set
a what do you mean by fact family okay i see a lot of people are working on fact families some people are still working on fractions paper i m finished read the bonus box
back i don t get how i can get some of this on this line so now when you looked at the pictures here is it a fraction example this looks good now here you said this is a fraction so you need to shade in one part example okay
part all right i want to do a quick check show of hands how many people are working on sailing along with fractions raise your hand okay
hands down on this paper they re going to give you a list of numbers family huh can you make 2 multiplication and 2 division number sentences
in if you can t you re going to circle the set so look at this huh so you want to go back and fill this in yes you just yes if you circle the set it means you don t have to fill in the numbers on the suitcases did you get it yeah i finished every sort of all right
now on this right here you re saying that this times this equals this no but when i look at this list of numbers you can t change that number true good so if it s not true you can go ahead and you can circle
work so now on the suitcase we can leave everything blank cause it doesn t check out i like how you made it true but it doesn t say that you have to do that it says that if it doesn t work you can just leave it blank okay okay all right boys and girls one more minute and then we re going to see if we can chart a course for our boats
yes this is what you can do now if you like on the back of the paper okay yes
so you have to leave like these on the suitcases yes so those will be left right okay and then you meet the good i already did all right boys and girls what i want you to do is i want you to look at the picture and i m going to go across the top of each row hand i want you to tell me yes or no does the picture show a fraction
if you say yes i m going to shade in one part of the picture and you re going to tell me which word describes the picture does this show a fraction yes yes all right so i m going to shade in one part of it
j okay look at the very next picture does this show a fraction no not sure pieces are these pieces equal to each other suppose this was a cookie
you got this much cookie and i get this much cookie same or different sizes right fractions are always fair equivalent so for this picture it does not show equivalent so i don t have to do anything m yeah is this a fraction no
i m going to go on to the next picture m fourths fourths very good huh yes which fraction very good
yes is this is a fraction yes yes fraction sixths okay i m going to go and start the next row
yes it s not a fraction very good yes what would you call this fraction thirds
yeah that s fourths excellent what s the name of this shape no it s not a fraction so i m going to go on to the next one
p thirds yes and this does show thirds
h do you agree okay this we re taking turns that ninths ninths okay
row does this show a fraction g
this 70 eighths eighths okay look at the next picture
l yeah what would you call this fourths fourths yeah what would you call this
a rhombus it s a rhombus and which word would describe this rhombus halves split into halves good next
fraction let s see n is this a fraction no wait no yes it is all right so i m going to shade in one piece
n fifths fifths okay now to see the course that the ship should take i m going to take my pencil i m going to put it on the 1st picture and i m going to trace a line
so i m going to over one down one over one down one i m going to go over 2 more squares up 2 more squares over one actually i should say over 2 and then down 2 and then i go right out the door
taken this is the course from start to finish 0 now down below i did tell a couple of kids not too many that there s a bonus box up i want you to look at the bonus box and it says that we re going to draw 4 different figures
j like a shape it s a shape so over here on my geometric board i have some different shapes you also saw some shapes in the front like said the rhombus is split into halves so that s a shape what you need to do is draw 4 different figures 4 different shapes on the back of the paper over and on the 1st shape that you draw i want you to divide it into halves
the 2nd shape i want you to divide it into thirds the 3rd shape you re going to split that into fourths and the last shape you could split it into sixths so you re drawing 4 shapes but you re going to show me 4 different fractions for 4 different shapes for each of the shapes that you draw when you do the splitting shade in one piece
what s the key thing when i m making fractions making equal equal parts equivalent so i m going to take it make sure all my pieces are equivalent tiny i can certainly make them bigger than this what i see in the front
back for the 3 kids that started this you can make 4 other shapes and do the same thing so let me give you a couple of moments
around i want to see a good example of 4 different shapes split into 4 different fractions with one piece shaded in today fractions you look at the list
fourths and then the last shape you draw is sixths one is a circle and circle you could shapes if we make it you re going to label each one
so you re going to draw the parts words and make sure you shade in one piece make sure it s something that is good quality that we could put under the camera
halves my shape okay fractions i need to see one piece shaded in an example
i need to see it written in words halves thirds fourths and then sixths yep that was nice thank you how many people are still working on drawing their fractions their shapes their fractions okay minute that s teacher c
yep they re good but i want you to use words okay like and then with the words i think we can also use numbers what why don t you put the words and the numbers together wait we have to do words words to describe just like we did on the front
fractions 0 okay okay if you would like to go ahead and also write down the fraction write down the number form so we could have the word form the number form that s okay now the other class didn t do that but let s be different
shapes i need to see those 4 fractions i did it shapes all 4 different shapes yeah you can look at mine mine is different shapes that looks good each yes you copied all right that looks good can you write a word for each that s an oval ooh that s excellent
how about shading in a piece for each of your fractions this i did mine look teacher c
i want to see the bonus box what it looks like paper and let me ask the class some questions checklist did draw 4 different shapes
shapes a half a square name the shapes 0 a square square circle triangle and all right 2nd thing did she make the fractions correctly so halves equal parts yeah how many parts 2 equal parts parts 3 good equal parts yes how many parts 4 equal parts
parts 6 so the number of parts 6 parts is sixths 4 parts is fourths 3 parts is thirds halves and then she wrote the number form for each so this is one out of 2 shaded one out of 3 shaded one out of 4 shaded and one out of 6 shaded excellent i did
job mine s not very neat well you can make it neat
eraser okay so 0 he got yeah all the time look at my paper i did mine 1st all right i m going to wait because right now calling out is not going to get the job done 0 okay i want you to take a look at s paper
shapes yes good did he show the fractions accurately yes no 0 i m no he didn t show the fractions correctly he didn t use word form he didn t show it correctly and he didn t show it correctly well let s talk about it
correctly the 16th is a 9 all right so for this one right here wow say that again 9 so this fraction is one ninths one ninths and that doesn t match huh the real 16th but he made it one ninths yes so how can we fix it
you could erase one row okay so we could take a column out down all right now that s a rectangle 6 equal parts one out of 6 shaded in
paper you never go in the back row okay this is s paper do you all of them no i didn t i didn t copy him i see words fractions i think the only thing is i didn t there s one part of the directions that wasn t followed
direction no you it was draw and then what was the rest of that sentence those are different draw 4 different figures which we said means the same thing as draw 4 different shapes yeah the thirds and the sixths so he split up a rectangle
rectangle maybe try drawing a different figure and then splitting it into sixths can we hand this back let me borrow your paper wait can you borrow mine that s not even s okay
now when you have the whole back of the paper to use i saw people using a part of the paper only a fraction of the paper but i see right here that has used a lot of the paper to make some nice big drawings so right here this right here is a square divided into thirds
she wrote 13rd as a fraction or one out of 3 shaded and then the word thirds and then you can see these other examples c teacher c can you do mine please how about one more and then i want to be able to move on cause we have some more activities
room i did okay i m looking at this shapes i see the same fractions that we just read in the bonus box
accordingly i also see the words and the numbers the fractions that also represent the pictures good all right now i want to talk about fact families fact families multiplication and division so i want you to look at that paper fact family airlines
division read each set of numbers if the set can be used to make a fact family write the fact family on the suitcase with the matching letter if the set cannot be used to make a fact family circle the set so it says here baggage claim and we see bags arranged in a circle
numbers we have to decide is it a fact family or no a there s a bag right here are we going to claim that bag family if yes i want you to give me 4 number sentences
if no i m going to go ahead and circle or loop that family and then go on to the next problem talking i need 100% of your attention
ahead 3 times 6 equals 18 18 let me make this bigger 2nd i m going to use a pen cause this is not showing very well
6 okay and finally 18 divided by 6 is 3 okay the next family is b 7 8 and then 56
question may i go to the bathroom after class you may go numbers 8 times 7 equals 56 7 times 8 equals 56
7 56 divided by 7 equals 8 c is this a fact family 4 7 and then 35
raised fact family no no okay when i walked around the room and i saw s paper also agreed no and she showed me why it was no family because 4 times 7 isn t 35 28 it s 28
all right so because 4 times 7 is 28 this is not a fact family so the directions tell me to circle it and because it s circled we don t have to put it into the baggage claim family yes good let s arrange these numbers into number sentences
18 9 times 2 equals 18 18 times 2 equals 9 by yeah 18 divided by 9 equals 2
e is this a fact family 6 8 and then 48 see pretty good this side this side
yet i m trying to get everybody
48 keep going 8 times 6 equals 48 division 48 divided by 8 is 6
12 is that a fact family okay let s arrange these numbers and we re going to arrange it in bag f 0 multiplication 3 times 4 okay
next we have a guest teacher c you sure
thanks okay all right you said 3 times 4 equals 12 and 4 times 3 equals 12 sentences 12 divided by 4 is 3 excellent 12 divided by 3 equals 4
g is this a fact family 4 9 and 36 yes yes 36 all right so i have to go to g which is up here
good excellent 36 divided by 9 is 4 9 okay now we re down to letter h 15 is this a fact family 3 7 and 15
no no 21 good so if 3 times 7 is 21 and 21 is not here we can t get this to be a fact family so i m going to go ahead and i m just going to circle it
out on the top of the paper you can put a checkmark on it i want one person from each table to collect both of the classwork papers the sailing along with fractions and the fact family papers and please put it into the pass in bin teacher c i ll check them out when we go to specialists yeah
nice air jordans 0 my god who i made them all right boys and girls one person at each table puts it in the pass in bin tickets after i give out some tickets we can line up for specialists me i m the collector go in my desk on the left side and grab me some tickets
tickets i m only down to one ticket
couple a couple is really a couple short okay i m going to count to 5 i want bodies in seats one just put it in the bin back to your seat 23 see if i can give these away
anyway all right a couple of questions today what is a fraction i m looking for a good definition in your own words
m a fraction is the pieces divided into halves fourths thirds i know those are all examples of fractions right halves thirds fourths sixths but what is a fraction
questions a fraction is a piece of i mean part of an object you re on the right track a said that it is a part of an object or it s part of a whole but i want you to describe that part in detail a put it all together
is a fraction is an equivalent it s equivalent well you can see equal right equivalent equal parts of think about what said of of a shape of a shape or you could say a whole shape
right it doesn t matter what the shape is a whole square a whole triangle a whole circle a whole rectangle
fraction a fraction is an equal part of a whole is a fraction is equal parts to an object an equal part of a whole right
tickets somebody tell me a fraction that s equivalent to one half c 2 and 42 fourths is equal to a half give me something different from
2 fourths is equal to a half away no so i don t mind if you look at the card sheet give me something equivalent to 2 fourths is the same as a half what else is equal to a half or 2 fourths you got to look at the card
i m going to come back to t 3 sixths 3 sixths is equal to it makes a whole i mean a a half is equal to 2 fourths here s a ticket give me something different from anything we ve heard
4 eighths 4 eighths is equal to a half it s equal to 2 fourths it s equal to s 3 sixths i have one ticket left so how about one more question fraction tomorrow we re going to talk about adding fractions if i said and you can use your card let me put my card back up this is a little preview for tomorrow
this is where we ll pick up suppose i said 16th +3 sixths is equal to how many sixths raise your hand if you think you can give the answer to that question
now raise your hand my arm hurts she doesn t ah it s okay i wouldn t want to put i said i wasn t going to put anybody on the spot all right so 16th +3 sixths equals how many sixths what s the answer 4 sixths not quite done yet said it s 4 sixths you know 16th +3 sixths equals 4 sixths somebody want to simplify this for me and then this will be a great way to finish
i totally get it but let s just see if we can get this last 14 sixths is equal to another way to say 4 sixths 2 thirds you can look at your card if you want thirds all right tomorrow we will pick up
now stand up for line up and it s time for physical education class
okay we are going to review the weight of objects in metric units today is march 24
review and we are going to just use some objects we re going to use a spring weight to measure some objects in grams because remember we have been talking about grams and kilograms this week with ms okay so we re just going to do some measurement today and you re going to record those measurement in your book and you are going to compare objects
so each group you have one and this is called what is this called a weight a spring weight a spring weight a spring weight you re going to use the bottom of this part of the spring weight to whatever object it is that you want to measure and we have already selected some objects
objects i have already placed some objects on your desk that you can use to measure you re going to record book you re going to write the weight on your spring if you take your spring out from your desk it s in your little purple basket
group look at it sides one says as a letter g and one has a little n
okay if you look at it it says 1000 where the letter g is here everybody get close in so we can all see
for grams grams okay and hold it up over to the group okay and it s in some starts at 0 do you see 0 weight yes 25 50 75
25 some of you have different numbers some of you have 100 200 300 that some of you are going to also find that when you put your objects on here it s going to drop down faster than some because the spring in it is wind a little tighter in each spring scale
see we are going to use that and we are going to quickly go ahead and quickly one person at a time is going to put an object on okay you re going to take say for example we re going to measure the tape group they re going to all write what are you going to write in your book
the weight tape you re going to write the object s name name you re going to put it on the hopefully it holds you re going to put it on the didn t it hold before okay are we supposed to put scotch tape for that what yeah or you can put paper tape
go and so you would hold it and then someone would look it and see what it weighs and then write the weight in your book okay we just have a few minutes to do that so everybody should be participating has my book okay
go ahead and weigh okay at okay
okay look at the measurement how much it weighs £400 no it s not that okay if you use it to measure one object then you can pass it to somebody else 0 because i was wondering why it was there try to find a way you were right before you could just yeah yeah like that let it go
okay how much does it weigh it s over it s over 250 on you need to be writing down the names of the objects that you re going to be using
100 okay somebody else can measure okay number okay
friends okay over 250
how much is the hole punch over 250
it okay i m waiting i m waiting okay most of us should have finished recording at least 3 objects because that s all we had time to do do we have 444 too what did you do
okay what did you find out about your measurement what did you find out yes that some of them were kilograms and some of them were grams how do you know they were kilograms because they were over 200 because they were over 250 grams right so you d have to use kilograms to measure those heavier object yes i weighed 500
okay what did you weigh did you find out anything with those 5 objects my agenda weighs 200 grams it weighed 200 grams okay very good right yes the basket weighed less than the tape the basket weighed less than the tape cause there s some objects that are going to weigh more and there are some objects that are going to weigh less less review now i need you to put your spring back into the purple basket
put your purple basket back on the floor okay the rest of the objects i want one person from your table to collect those objects and put them back where you got them from person i like the way this table
away okay put it over there okay very good
diagram cause this is strategy that we use how many of you remember any other strategies that we talked about before problem and i see somebody going back and looking back in their books because this is not the 1st time we have solved problems using different kinds of strategies
okay process of elimination process of elimination use multiply mentally multiply mentally okay so there s several different strategies that we can use when we solve problems
yes okay yes local reasoning ah logical reasoning good so there are many different types of ways that we can or different strategies that we can use to problem solve
okay so we re going to solve problems today using what kind of strategy make a diagram make a diagram yes it s something that you use that is like 2 circles you combine like one has something on this side and one has something on the other side you re talking like this
that a venn diagram a venn diagram yeah that s a diagram so a diagram is what then any kind of diagram picture any kind of picture that we can use okay a table a venn diagram okay so we are going to use make a diagram today and the diagram that we re going to use we re going to go through the different steps that we do to solve a problem
go okay
remember when we problem solve we have to 1st do what understand we have to 1st understand the problem right yeah okay
so we re going to look at the problem and if you turn to page 348 in your math books let s look at the problem while this thing comes on problem read for me
problem daryl and charles each caught a fish the 2 fish have a weight of 10 kilograms the weight of charles fish is one kilogram more than twice the weight of daryl s fish what is the weight of each fish okay
problem daryl and charles went fishing and they caught a fish okay daryl and charles caught a fish while they were fishing kilograms the weight of charles fish is one kilogram more than twice the weight of daryl s fish
fish so the 1st thing we have to do is to understand the problem okay what are you asked to find the weight of the fish what are you asked to find fish what information will you see what will you use what information you re going to use
use understand what information are you going to use use the information in the problem what information in the problem the 2 fish have a weight of 10 kilograms okay so we re going to use what what and what s the total weight what s the total weight of the 2 fish
10 kilograms 10 kilograms so what are we asked to find how much each fish what is the weight of each fish the weight of each fish okay so the plan that we re going to do is make a diagram make a diagram right this how can you use the diagram strategy to solve the problem
make a diagram showing the relationship between the weights of the 2 fish okay charles fish and daryl s fish okay charles fish blank blank because it s how many times and one kilogram and daryl s fish is that and the total weight is 10 kilogram
here read in your book what quietly how you going to solve it blue the letter is in blue the letters in blue
together subtract one kilogram from 10 kilograms to find the sum of the 3 equal parts subtract one kilogram from 10 kilograms to find the sum of the 3 equal parts okay so what are you going to do 1st subtract subtract one kilogram from 10
okay so in order to find 3 equal parts what are you going to do next parts so divide the sum by 33 to find the value of each part each part equals 3 so each part is 3 kilograms so each part is 3 kilograms so daryl s fish has a weight of what
3 +3 +one daryl s fish has a weight of what kilograms and charles fish has a weight of 3 +3 +3 +3 +one or 7 kilograms or 7 kilograms okay
right let s look at so we re going to check what other strategy could you use to solve this yes you could make a pictograph you could make a pictograph good
yes tally mark how would tally marks help you got see how much who got daryl and charles okay what is daryl and charles
mark how much how much what fish they caught okay you how much they weigh how much they weigh okay so would we use tally marks m use a double bar graph you could probably use a double bar graph okay
anything else but how would you find out if you use a double bar graph how are you going to know how much fish the weight of each fish that information is not given to you okay they gave you the total number of the fish fish and you have to find out what each fish weigh okay
and they give you the total weight of the fish and they also tells you that the weight of charles fish is one kilogram more than twice the weight of daryl s fish okay so those are the information that you have to use in order to solve the problem so you have to be careful in what strategy you use to get to the answer
right let s look at another let s look at some other problems look in your book on number one
book okay that sit up
sit up up okay anybody got the answer
out okay 1st we have to understand the problem understand what is it asking you to do
hah what are you asked to find how many fish did each catch how many fish did each catch many yeah okay
okay what s the next thing you re going to ask use what information will you use the number of fish what information give me the specific information what information will you use yes caught a total of 24 fish bob caught what information will you use
use we have to pick out specifically what we are going to use yes the total number of fish they caught what what are total number of fish they caught
fish 24 fish and then what else what else are you going to use number of fish she caught 4 more fish yes and then what else what else are you going to use
that don caught fish okay mean double okay use there s 24 fish 4 more fish and twice as many
okay so how are you going to solve
yes multiply 24 times i didn t hear that divide 24 divided by okay diagram remember that s the strategy that we re trying to use
diagram using those information make a diagram and it was hot in here
here it s cold in here let s open this door and see
okay did we draw a diagram yes on the outside we can draw a diagram similar to what they have
but we have to make sure we have 3 cause we have 3 people val don and brent
24 val caught 4 more fish than brent and dan caught twice as many fish as brent
fish brent i mean don val caught 4 more fish than brent fish val caught 4 more fish than brent and dan caught twice as many fish as brent
fish brent brent has the lowest amount so we kind of know that okay so how much do you think it has to total 24
63 val caught 4 more fish than brent brent and dan caught twice as many fish as brent
fish we said that okay yes you did fish who still has the smallest amount of fish then 28 wait wait wait 66 so how much would brent caught remember it has to add up to 24
okay so don caught 10 fish okay so don caught twice as many fish as brent do divided by we divide by because double because double right
2 so we divided 10 divided by 25 so how much would val caught then 9 why because he caught 4 more than brent because he got 4 more than brent
did yep he got 4 more than brent if you have one pencil and brian beside you had 4 more pencils than you how much pencils do you think brian had if you have one pencil and brian has 4 more pencils than you have how many pencils does brian have
you have one pencil and he has 4 more than you how many pencils does brian have 5 do add 4 pencils to one good so then if brent has 5 fish and val has 4 more fish than brent how many fish does val have
hah val have how many 9 val have how many many 4 more than brent what 5 +45 +4 equal 9 now are we finished no
d figure out add what 99 +1010 +5 to see what if they have 24 fish if they add up to 24
groups quickly quickly into your groups quickly into your groups quickly into your groups quickly let s go
quickly quickly you got to sit go to your group okay 1234 okay go this is my chair buddy go find a where s the chair that was there i don t know
pull one of those chairs over there get to work what are we doing 1st
top okay everyone put your names let me read hurry up guys get to work work where were you going
go over there please teacher okay me read number one for me please
a total of 14 items twice the number of items that she
do wait divide what are we going to do do each right
sara so we re going to make a chart or diagram do what are the specific what are we going to use
her young man what are we going to use we re going to use division what are we going to use
else what other information are we going to use sara bought okay 2 more what the to total them up right did they say to total up did they say the total i don t no
beginning did you read the very beginning of the problem yeah yeah so did they give us the total they gave us the total right are this is our total and the total is what 14 14 14 what 14 items okay so 14 items they got at the grocery store
okay so now we have to find out how much did each of them buy buy okay so all this add up to 14 so what do you think
more because there s going to be one with more than the other right
it so sara brought 2 more than twice the number of items that steve bought so how much did sara buy sara sara has more so we already know that sara s number is going to be what
bigger bigger than pass that for me i didn t do that sara s number is going to be bigger than who than steve than steve s right so her number is going to be bigger than steve s so let s see what is sara s number then number we re going to divide what are you going to divide 14
2 14 divided by 2 equals what 7 equals 7 and then what no 14 divided by 2 and then what add
add what 7 she bought 2 more than twice 2 more than twice okay so sara bought 7 okay they re copying me
sara bought 2 more than twice the number of items so 2 more than twice the number of items so if steve had 2 more than twice the number so twice the number of steve s item is 8 and then 2 more is 2 more than 8 is what
44 then we add 10 +4 equals 14 i kind of thought it would be 7 +7 but until i started understanding it then i okay
so we 1st okay we have 14 -2 is that where you re supposed to 12 you and 12 divided by let s see divided by no see okay
one what does steve got he s got 4 you need to write it down what you got do we write steve yeah diagram why is it cause they re writing the total at the bottom 0
equals and then total items equal total items equal what 14
14 okay i get it now okay
you need to be over here on this bucket bring this bucket around here
bring that bucket around here around here okay
okay if we check this out sara has 2 more than twice the number of items so sara has if she has 5 and she bought 2 more than twice so twice 5 is what 10 twice 5 is 10 +2 would be what 12 so is this correct
no okay so when you check it when you check it let me see what has 4 let s check s 4 twice 4 is what 88 +2 is what
10 so is his correct yeah he has 10 and 4 14 so isn t that correct okay answer what did you do to get that answer you need to listen to him and let him explain how he got the answer
m what are you guys doing over here okay
number one says what what are you okay me what do you understand what is going on
most sara sara s going to have more than steve but 9 and 5 is 14 but if we check hold this if we check 5 okay check sara has bought twice the number of items so 5 times 2 is what
10 right away 9 is not correct because right away steve would have 10 sara would have 10 so far 17 so is that correct it s 12 and 2 2 because that s 14 yeah but if you do it the same way sweetie you got to do it like i do it
66 and 4 is what 10 or 6 +2 or whatever you have there 2 is 8 okay i m still stuck all right what 14 divided by 3 is 14 take away
2 14 take away what 1st 2 14 take away 2 is what 12 and 12 divided by what 12 divided by 12 divided by 3 equals 4 yeah 4 let s see
yeah 12 divided by 3 equals +4 so say he had 4 what 888 and then she had 2 more is so sara would have 10 and he would have 4 okay i don t get number 2
do we re going to understand understand so do we understand the problem 1st of all you can t just say i don t get it that s the 1st thing understand it
okay what do you understand i understand that there is and 1st of all what should you not do
car okay her that s everybody cause you re all responsible for reading the problem do you get it now
me like my read 2 more books 2 more than twice the number of books that emily read emily read one book less than mike how many books did each person read so we have 3 people right
they michael okay paper can we underline them where on your paper are you going to write it names yeah you can underline the names in the problem and then what are you going to do do divide 4 divided by why
divide divided by 2 equals 22 +2 equals 4 okay why are we dividing again cause this group is being a little bit too loud because 4 divided by 10 equals why are we dividing
okay 1st of all we have to find out who has more more are you sure read the problem again
yeah it s here has the most book right because mike read 4 books althea read 2 more than twice the number of books that emmie read and emmie read one book less than mike
mike and then emily has the the least okay so let s make our plan who would go 1st
yes ma m so althea has 2 more than twice the number of althea has twice the number of books okay
so althea has twice the number of books 1st of all we have to look at what mike read books so that s the 1st thing we re going to write is mike he read how many books 4 books and then we look at althea mike read 4 books so we know that right
so we don t have to look up what mike read cause they already told us what mike read books now we have to find out what thea and emily read right hm okay so mike so thea look up thea thea read 2 more than twice the number of books that emily read but emily read one less book than mike
read if she read one less book than mike what would we do what 44 -one leaves 3 so now we can find out what thea has what thea has what 8 what did you do
6 it said she has thea has what she read 2 more than twice so i am only so 2 more than twice you did what i times 3 by 2 and i added 2 and then 2 times 3 is what
next add add it up to see how many each person how many in total okay do they ask us that did it ask us how many books did each person read
up because it only asks how many books did each person read so we have got all the information excellent high 5 for that excellent job very good all right guys get back to your yes
543 those who are from another class you may go back 2 those who have national math i need a line
teacher do you want me to erase your table yes you can erase my table hands okay you need to be over there with a pencil a paper and your card
line okay guys get ready for recess
we re going to review some of the strategies that we used before to solve these problems could you please read the problem that you have on your paper
janet has 1780 marbles she wants to put them into bags each of which holds 32 marbles how many full bags of marbles does she have how many full bags of marbles does she have
me janet has 1780 marbles she wants to put them into bags each of which holds 32 marbles how many full bags of marbles does she have so what are we going to do
divide to find out how many marbles she can put in all her bags how many groups of what marbles of 3232 marbles can we get out of 1780 now let s read the problem together
janet has 1780 marbles she wants to put them into bags each of which holds 32 marbles how many full bags of marbles does she have janet has 1780 marbles she wants to put them into bags each of which holds 32 marbles how many full bags of marbles does she have so as said that she is trying to see how many bags of what marbles 3232 marbles can she get out of
782780 marbles so she is grouping them into bags of 32 yes now so do you agree that we are going to divide divide because we re finding out how many bags does she need
agree because we want to find how many marbles we re going to put into each bag how many marbles we are going to put marbles so we are actually trying to find how many groups of 32 marbles how many bags of 32 marbles can we get out of 1780 marbles
so we are going to divide as you said and we are going to use the new strategy for division that we have been using so it is 1000 can you see from the back yes 1732 huh it s 1780
much 1000 very sorry out so it s 1780 and we are going to find out how many groups of what
marbles so look at the figure it s a pretty it s fairly it s a fairly big figure what groups could you think we could start with s 55 i think 5 makes 15 a 2020 is a much more decent figure here
all right so let s see 20 times 32 and that s equal to 64640 so already we took 20 groups of 32 and that gives us a total of what 64640 please don t write anything yet
do we re going to subtract since we already take out this group of 20 so we are going to subtract 10411 so let s see if you think it will be let s see if we can get another group of 20
3220 times 32 is equal to 640 640 what are we going to do subtract subtract because we have to take out another group of 20 so 00 and 6 from 00 and 11 from 6
55 so we re left with 500 there okay 10 times 32 is equal to twety 320 so 320 and what are we going to do subtract subtract because we re subtracting the group of 10 that we took out okay
so 0010 from 2 is 8 so we are going to borrow we are going to regroup okay 4 it s 10 multiple students it would be 106185 so 5 let s try 55 times 32 is equal to
multiple students 160 okay 5 times 05 okay 160 okay 5 to stand is 53s is 15 and 160 okay so this is 160 so 02 yes
i can t see okay just can you push up a little closer if you can t see the overhead is in the way 0 it s in the way all right just shift yourself so you can see then good so let s see how many groups we have groups of 32 we have so far
2040 +20 +20 that s 40 +1050 plus so it s going to be 55 bags so it s 55 bags and how many are how many are left over
20 marbles all right so as said let s write this 55 full 55 full bags and how many left over 20 marbles 20 marbles left over 20 left over 20 marbles marbles left over
so give me a better way tell me a better way to say 20 left over 20 remain remainder remainder so it s going to be 55 remainder remainder 2020 that means that we have we have 20 extra bags of marbles yes 20 extra marbles
yes you could do it one more time if we divide by 32 can we get 32 out of 20 m i think he means because there s remember we re trying to see how many groups of 32
right but i think that he means since there s 1780 marbles that you could put 20 marbles into it but we re trying to find groups of 32
32 so already we have 55 groups out of the 1780 and 20 marbles are leftover bigger 3232 okay so we have remainder 20 out of this total
it all right now please open your books to we re going to continue exercises and unit 3 page 64 everybody please turn to unit 3 page 64 there unit 3 page 64 a were we supposed to write that teacher yes you can copy this one
copy this one for reference copy this one for reference right now yes you can do so now
please and i am going to ask i am going to ask to solve number one for me
yes page you are at unit 4 page 64 i am going to ask you to do number one
overhead you can bring your book your book please read the problem there are 216 students everybody s following in their book
64 hold on on come on are there are 216 students in the school marching band the director wants the band to march in rows with 12 students in each row
be there are 216 students in the school marching band band 216216 the director wants the band to march in rows in rows with 12 students each
be so tell me in your own words what do you understand from this problem i understand that the whole is 216
216 and the director wants to put 12 students in each row so i divide so he wants to see how many groups of 12 he can get out of 216216 okay go ahead same strategy as what we have bigger sweetie bigger so that your friends at the back can see
12 okay so what are you going to start with 12 and 20 how about what group how many groups
10 whoever is don t turn it off equals 120 next so he started with 10 groups right
to 12120 so what are we going to do now attention so write the 120 there
regroup one -2 is 91 goes up 96 okay how many groups of 12 you can get from 96 that 88 so write it there 8 times 12 equals 96
9696 so how many groups in all 181810 +8 is equal to 18 so our answer here is 18
there will be 18 rows of students job now any questions i can t see all right you want do you want to do the 2nd one
come everybody agrees with this 1818 rows rows all right now read your problem sweetie
okay for an inside assembly the band needs to fit on the stage with 24 students in each row now and they are using the same figure there s still 216 students
together for an inside assembly the band needs to fit on the stage with 24 students in each row be for an inside assembly the band needs to fit on the stage with 24 students in each row how many rows will there be now so we are trying to see what
216 how many rows of 24 students we can get out of a total of 216 yes can you explain the problem for me you are supposed to divide but why
do find out how much rows will be now how many rows of what students how many students 24 how many rows of 24 students we can get from 216
see what are you going to start with groups of
what 5 times 245 times 24 and that s equal to 121254s is 254 is 10
subtract subtract regroup regroup doing i regrouped from the 2 in a 10 to a one took and i added a one and 11 take away 2 equals 9
so how many times does 24 goes into 964 so 2444 who said 4
okay 9696 so how many groups of 24 can we get
9 rows of students that s too much rows very good me do problems 34 and 5 and then we will we will check them
5 thank you now number 3 states the marching band is raising money for new uniforms if each student in the band sells 12 raffle tickets how many tickets will they sell
what are we going to do s multiplication we are going to multiply s because we want to see how much each student will would sell it says the marching band is raising money for new uniforms
if each student in the band sells 12 raffle tickets how many tickets will they sell so what are we trying to do we re trying to find the total of how many tickets that 12 students will that what sell that that 12 students will sell no that s not what we re finding
out we re already told that the number of times 12 sell so it says the marching band is raising money for new uniforms if each student in the band sells 12 raffle tickets how many tickets will they sell now each student in the band will sell 12 tickets and there are 216 students in all so what would be the total number of tickets sold if each student sells 12
12 multiplied yes because we re trying to find the total and remember that multiplication is repeated what good so let s take 2 minutes to calculate to solve that one
yes 0 very good
cluster cluster good you cluster
very good good
see 216 times 12 this is giving you 22
12 and 10 no it s multiplying let me see yours let me see yours
okay so some people did use cluster clusters
let me see yours okay let s see what you did 12 times 12 equal
strategy you can see are you supposed to writing in your notebook yes you can but see what is doing 1st everybody see what she s doing sh
all eyes on the board please all eye on the overhead equals 1200 and then i did another one she s working in groups of 100 and then i went to 10s and it equals times 12 120 and then i did 6 times 12 equals 76 and then i added them together and this equals 2
7 +2 is 92 +2 is 4 +one is 5 and then i added 2 onto this too great job
r so where is the so it s 216 times 12 so what she did she broke down 216 into smaller chunks that was easier to work with so she had 100 times 12 and then another 100 then 10 times 12 then 6 times 12
so 100 +200 100 plus another 100 that is 200 +10 210 +6 216 now i think this is a very efficient strategy and many of you many of you used this strategy
too huh yes come and see did you get it with this done let me see who has a different strategy 5552 you are something short there
yours almost the same thing please all right let me see
that s almost similar to what she had
job great let me see yours
correct double check to see where you made the mistake yours do you know a more efficient strategy that you could use yes yes let me see yours
i did 2 i did it cluster mistake 0 this is 25 so that s pretty okay now
it yeah so has a different strategy that he is going to show us
s okay sweetie sorry 0 that s yours sorry
it bigger bigger sweetie bigger bigger bigger you have a lot space here room okay all right
doing now you have to explain to us what you are doing know you need to teach us that method that strategy 216 so it s the problem let s write the problem here it s 216 times what 12 times 12 equals
i broke up 216 and 12 they can t hear you sweetie i did 200 and can t hear you
10200 times 10 and 16 times 10200 times 10 equals louder
time i broke up 216 and 10 box breaking up numbers it s unmarked array thank you
so i broke up 216 into 216 into so i did 200 times 10 equals 2000 16 times 10 is 160 200 times 2 is 400 and 16 times 2 is 32 much thank you thank you
all right we have another minute so could you do number 4 number 4 quickly very quickly very quickly number 4 number 4 number 4 states new t shirts cost $24 each
how much will it cost to buy a new t shirt for each student in the band multiply somebody who i didn t call on before how much s multiply new t shirts cost $24 each
how much will it cost to buy a new t shirt for each student in the band do multiply what are we going to do do she said multiply speak louder
do multiply what are we going to do multiply multiply now thank you very much
okay make sure you listen all right today we re going to be talking we re going to be working in chapter 3 all right in your big math book 48 and this chapter is going to be it s called algebra
and you know we have been doing some algebra but now we re going to really get into it this 9 weeks right so you should be chapter 3 page 48 and you re going to need your journal so please pull out your journal math journal journal you ll need your pencil and we re going to spend about 15 minutes going over this
yes okay just look on with while we re doing this please okay you should have your journal open to a new page new page quickly new page in your journal new page in your journal please
okay you re going to title it expressions and variables board but they re also in your book on page 48 all right who can tell me think algebra what an expression is
now there s other types of expressions today hopefully i ve been smiling that means i m somewhat happy a little happier than i was on friday right happier i m not talking about my mood that type of expression this is one related to math idea anybody has anybody ever heard the word put your hand up if you ve heard the word expression in math
mean a problem i can t explain it right hard to explain okay it s like like 5 +5 or a number or something okay
m a math phrase it is a phrase sentence 5 +5 you had divide it what do you have in that expression a plus sign you have a plus sign
that what else do you have in this mathematical expression 5 okay what are those called variables but we re going to write the definition and it s right in your book okay
book you re going to write expression and you re going to copy it out of the book it it says an expression is a mathematical phrase phrase mathematical phrase
there that combines numbers like his 55 it also has operation signs +and sometimes variables
a variable you guys have been working with them like a variables huh like a +5 equals 10 teacher right and sometimes variables okay the important thing about an expression it does not have any equal sign in it
an expression does not use and equal sign or an inequality symbol okay sign so an example let s write some examples below someone he gave me 5 +5 is that an expression
expression 6 +6 +4 okay how about one that says and sometimes it uses variables someone other than because he s been answering answering can someone else think of an expression look in your book today
possibly you ll see a lot of b s and c s when you get older b s and c s in your equations written i m going to erase it and i m going to put the word the other vocabulary word i want you to know variable do you have this one copied
48 the yellow word any time you see a yellow word very important to know journal okay
variable variable is a letter or symbol that stands for one or more numbers okay so let s write that it s a letter or symbol read that to me again that stands that stands for one or more numbers that stands for one or more numbers
okay give me an example it also says a times 7 i m sorry what is it a times 7 a times 7 yeah okay a examples a times 7 what s the variable everybody
a okay that represents your unknown okay the variable is your unknown 13 plus x -2 okay look at that 13 plus x -2 no no but we re going to figure it out somehow okay
it represents it can represent one or more numbers who can give me another expression that has a variable in it 12 plus x +2 okay 2 plus x +2 what s the variable guys
book let s look at the example look at example one in the blue box tank then he added 3 more fish tank you have to write an expression for that everybody 12 teacher how many does he add
what that s our expression sign we re just writing the expression okay understand all right let s look at example 2
tank then she gave she gave some fish to her sister with 12 ooh again had 16 fish in her tank
m she gave some to her sister she gave some to her sister write an expression to show how many fish are in the tank now does that sound like we re going to do an addition expression or a subtraction subtraction okay so what symbol are we going to use several minus all right how may did she give to her sister
s s learn a variable us yes they picked and f
yes yeah could i put an x me it said you can put symbols too okay you can put symbols so we wrote and expression 2 expressions and what did those expressions not have they don t have an equals sign
today let s look at a couple more examples yourself sarah had 15 apples in a basket eaten do we know how many were eaten
no let a equal the number of apples eaten that in your journal see if you can write an expression everybody 15 and some are eaten add subtract subtract
subtract so 15 minus what what guys
a huh pretend that a equals 10 for me a 15 minus a now i want you to pretend that a equals 10
it what are we going to do what we re going to put the 10 in for a and then subtract and we can solve the equation
5 because i m going to replace a with 10 and now i can solve it no i have a mathematical sentence okay g do you have one like that louder i can t hear you they had something like that in the math calendar okay good all right let s look at a couple more examples
let s go to where it says to check in the red listening okay look at number one it says explain why 6 is an unreasonable value for n in this expression why 6 doesn t make sense lyle has some fish has some fish he buys 3 more fish and then he sells 10 fish
board all right it says lyle has some fish no then lyle he buys 3 more do add +3 +3 okay then what does it say
and then he sells 10 okay it says y is 6 an unreasonable answer unreasonable why can t this n be 6 somebody has 6 plus equals 9 yeah if i put 6 in for that n if i replace n with 6 guess what i get
it 6 +3 -10 what s 6 +399 -10 reasonable okay -one journal see if you can write the expression without me doing it 1st
dimes he gave gary 4 write the expression sam had 10 dimes no no
0 write it neatly where s yours show me what you re doing okay give he gave gary 4 okay guys answer 10 -410 -4
okay let s do number 3 write the expression 11 added to 5 says 11 added to 5 i m on number 311 added to 5 do how are we going to write it
1111 added to 5 help her out be 11 added to 5 it s just exactly what it says
r 11 +5 no 11 added to 55 expression somebody other than you i ll let you have this 15 +11 that s 5 +115 +11 doesn t that mean 11 added to 5
it so that means you give me the answer 16 so sonny what s going to be our answer 1616 okay this is algebra guys groups number 4 kim had 24 cookies ate 6 and then baked 12 more
if you just do it kind of in sequential order you can write the expression
1st you re doing this one right here
6 so you re going to go 24 -6 more so are we going to add subtract multiply divide add +1212 problem give me the answer what did you get
30 you need to do 24 -61st which is what okay if you kind of think if you just kind of think of what you start with 1st sentence were there any variables in here
no were there variables up here everybody yes okay what what s the variable represent the number the number the unknown okay all right what you re going to do for homework tonight is you re going to do page 50
yes you re going to do the odds page 50 the odds okay and i m going to we re going to divide up into our groups
again okay you re sitting quietly the people this 1st group is going to be i don t have that don t move yet
it all right you re going to remember i talked about it earlier here you have to measure and get the perimeter everybody let s review perimeter what is perimeter distance around centimeters all right so i m going around
area and these look like compound figures this group figure inside okay all right that s this group you you re going to go ahead and start success maker this group the snap cube group we re going to be just reviewing volume
and that group will be all right when kevin gets off success maker you ll go over there but you can come back here to start up if you don t have the math coach book assignment done the chapter review we did today guess what
seat you cannot come to the group until you have the math crct review papers done so you re going to be building volumes you re going to actually build the figure and then solve and get the volume figure all right and then my last group was divisibility
divisibility that will be do you will need to come with your pencil you need to bring a piece of notebook paper if you re at this group
up all right and the directions are on the yellow piece of paper together if you ve forgotten your divisibility rules guess what below but you should have them and they re back here on the board class how do i know if a number s divisible by 6 ooh no we don t make sounds
we got to know we got to know r if it s divisible by 2 and 3 by 2 and 3 okay how do i know if this number s divisible by 3 louder you re right you and then see if it s divisible okay she said you add up all the digits and then divide by 3
if you can divide it by 3 evenly it is divisible by 3 s if some of the digits are divisible by 9 by 9 and if it s divisible by 9 then it should also what
so if you checked 9 on your paper you better make sure you have a check in 3 if you check 6 on your paper you should have a check in 2 and 3 if you check 10 on your paper 2 and 5 it should also be divisible by 55 and 2
understand i understand you need to come with notebook paper and a pencil group now if i don t call you if you re not at this group again you only go to the group if your coach book is done okay if i don t call you you re working on you can your group or you re working on the homework
okay let s have divisibility come here 1st up get what you need if you re leaving this area come what are snap cubes it s the volume you ll need paper also for snap cubes cause you ll have to do the volume shhh okay the perimeter area group s up in this area
shhh and we re going to 0 i love how we re transitioning very quietly okay if someone happens to be in your seat cause they re a station you have to go to a different area okay now i m going to be working with children over there emergency you had people at your table that you can ask and you re working together
okay okay what yes work okay you re working quietly
stay there he s on success maker and then he can do his homework math 0 tell him math homework kevin
work on your math homework all right i want shhh okay you should be in a group somewhere is name on something yeah she s on yes you got to listen i thought she was divisibility no she s not in here go to snap cubes then shhh do your homework until i call you okay
done i want marker quickly guys expo
pencil sh sh sh quickly just grab an extra marker up on the board
you where s okay 1st thing you come up here too
okay okay the 1st thing we re going to do is we re just you guys need we re going to make a couple flashcards 0 let me give you the right one okay i want you to write on the 1st okay you got to listen i want you to write the fraction one 2 fraction one 2
and on the back i want you to write the decimal what it s equal to in a decimal it .5 okay you re going to you re not going to look there directions one half on the back you should have 0.5 aside okay get another card i want you to write one 4 the fraction one 4
look now who knows what it s equivalent to in a decimal good girl good good so if you saw that in a problem and you had to convert it to the decimal you could do that right okay let s write one 3 on a new card
answer 13rd what is it equal to in decimal anybody remember .75 no 13rd .33 chart okay you re helping each other your group remember
other ms teacher can i get a okay let s do 2 thirds if one 3 is 0.33 what is 2 thirds going to be 13rd +13rd is 2 thirds so 0.33 +0.33 is 0.66
0.66 okay what other fraction do we see a lot that we need to know 34th 3 fourths yep 3 4 okay what do you think that s equal to in a decimal excellent you got to know 75.7 there s another one i want you to know
one 5 write one 5 now does anybody remember that one yes 15th is equal to 0.2 which is the same as 0.20 okay all right you re going to memorize these to help you okay
more okay i want you to put your name on them in the bottom corner really fast in each one in case they get lost corners last name just 1st name
and i m going to skooch in front of you okay and you got this one right but we ll okay
okay quickly remember you re keeping it quiet in a group shhh all right we re going to look at problem number 6 okay you got it right but look and see if you can do it again okay
again practice all right we have to put look at problem 6 order let s get one that s not right and that way here okay let s find you one that s right so you re not okay we have to put them in order from greatest to least
now if they give you a bunch of fractions how how are we going to put those in order it okay so somewhere on your board put 3 4 equals 0.75
small okay now they show another fraction don t they all show a half and 3 4 and 7 12 every one of these problems right all right do we know what one 2 is equal to in decimals what okay so put that down one 2 equals 0.5
all right now what about 7 12 really s so how are we going to figure out that decimal divide okay okay so 7 divided by 12 means that what s going to be in the doghouse
doghouse so put 7 in the doghouse cause we say that s the top dog top of the fraction
good there okay 120 wait wait sweetie you got it backwards you have it
we said what number s in the doghouse 77 how many times does 12 go into 7 if this number is bigger than that number it s a 0 right now what do you do
okay now what are we going to do guys 855 cause 12 times 5 is 6060 when you subtract you get what
that we need to go out further because if we don t we have one that s 0.5 right so how many 0 you need to add the 0 yeah but we re going to go out further with the decimal so how many times does 12 go into 110 see what probably 8 yeah 96 now could we stop there at 0.58
could we now compare decimals cause we have 0.75 and 0.58 okay but you see if we had stopped at 0.5 would we have been able to compare them very well what 7 twelfths equals what decimal .58
what let s make a new card for that everybody you can just learn that one again 7 twelfths equals 0.58 okay good job out there out now take these fractions and decimals and put them in order
how do you get 0.51 put them in order decimal i would put them all let me show you what i would do okay i see something did though and i m not picking on her 0.58 where should that point be
here .5 and what should we put here 0 now can we compare them yes which one she has them just right in order right biggest 3 fourths is the biggest
guys 7 twelfths and 0.5 is the smallest a it says 3 4 is greater than 7 12
7 12 and it s greater than one 2 is that correct b it says one 2 is greater than 7 12 no so you re going to get rid of that problem
find your paper if you missed it and cross through it if you missed it right but is one 2 greater than 7 12
is one 2 greater than 7 12 no cross through so our answer does make sense understand guys if you can convert fractions to decimals you can do this okay all right everybody yeah okay
how many missed number 8 who missed 8 did you miss 8 no okay but you missed the last one we just did right okay so let s we re going to review 8 just for even though he got this one right and then gets to pick out a problem he missed sorry okay you got it right 22 okay when it is says not a multiple of 23 guys what are you going to have to figure out
do we re going to county by 323 or exactly ways either write out 23 46 or divide each one by 23 okay so let s divide 40 which way you guys want me to do it
divide it or which way would you want to do or add it at divide it 23 how many times does it go see so that one was is a multiple all right let s look at 115
by 2323 how many times do you think it goes 3 well 3 would be 69 yeah 4 well 4 would be what 92 what happens if i do 5
yes all right 139 divided by 236 you think it s 6 get 138 is it going to come out evenly no over is that going to be a multiple no
it please you pick out a problem you missed 77 everybody look at their paper look at 7 who missed 7 you missed it it did you miss 7 she got that one right then she can help us okay which fraction is equivalent to 3 5
fractions you do what do how do you what multiple what together multiply the top and the bottom by the same number get did i just make an equivalent fraction
yes okay could i multiple by 3 if i multiply this by 3 what does this have to be i multiply by the same number which is really multiply by one if i so it s 9 15 and i m making equivalent fraction do you understand
again all right pick out one you missed if you missed that fix your answer cause you re going to have to correct this test tonight who missed 5 did you get 5 right cause we got one more left did you get 5 right let s pick another one
v pick another problem how many of you i want to do number 16 back this group needs to work a little quieter okay quieter you find perimeter and you all have to agree it won t work
it okay anybody miss 16 circles it says which number sentence is represented by the model
okay they re working with wholes and fractions aren t they so if you look at that 1st picture how many are shaded what fraction 13rd what fraction are shaded a 2 thirds 2 thirds how many are shaded in the next picture 2 thirds 2 thirds how many are shaded in the next picture how many are shaded in the next picture 3 fourths how many do we have of those 312344
to solve that you could go 4 times 2 thirds 2 thirds what s your answer it 0 okay it s 41234 time 2 thirds you see that it okay all right you guys i want you to go back to where you can find a seat
go right here and work on either your coach book or finish correcting your test or starting your math homework take your test with you me okay you keep these with you and i ll give you a baggie after math class okay yes all right good job i want and please
if you have 36 what can you multiply together to get 36 2180 i thought yeah yeah okay all right all right boys and girls take it down a notch please
okay look at your test you need to come over here down shhh shhh i don t want any problems or anybody will sit silent you work together individually if you re done then you can go back and finish your
if you re done and you don t have your gallon man if you are done and gallon man s done you work on your math homework but make sure you clean up your cubes shhh will you tell me when it s 11 please shhh take it back to your seat and start your homework okay
test where is your test did i give it back to you test all right guys what happened what happened to you
okay pick out a problem you both missed did you guys both get number 4 right okay how much do they pay all together amanda painted 3 8 of the doghouse painted 2 5 of the doghouse
do what would you do together 3 eighths +2 5s
on the count of one i want the room to get quieter 54 make sure you re doing your part in getting quieter 321 you would just add 3 8 +2 5 together right and then change get a common denominator
all right did you both miss did you miss 5 you guys board there s one you know what back sh sh all right i did this one on the board before the test remember
3 fourths if we have fractions and we want to put them in order from greatest to least what are we going to do 2 convert that in 2 decimals do you see you have the same fraction you have 3 4 one 2 every time
okay 3 fourths is equal to what decimal okay 0.751 half is what decimal one half one half .5.5 write that down
7 12 do you know what decimal that equals to so what are you going to do how would you change that into a decimal 7 twelfths how would you change that into a decimal divide okay me your divisor is 12 correct
and the top dividend is 7 you re dividing 12 into 7 okay i ll be right back while you re working on that would you please go a quieter follow my directions make sure you are doing your part in following my directions
dude i m on my this group you need to be quieter shhh okay go back to your seat and work on the other tell what you get
when you re done work on your coach book .5.5 what did you get done i need a better marker but watch how many times does 12 going 7 okay
how many times does 12 go into 75 okay where s my decimal going to go right what s 12 times 560 teacher now subtract okay if we leave it 0.5 can we compare it to our other 0.51 half right how many times does 12 going in ooh i have to add the 0 right
108 so it s 0.58 wrong it s cause i okay .58
okay i want my class out there in math land to quietly go back you stay here to their seat without talking go back to your seat without talking and work on your math homework until we go to lunch i want you to go to your seat without talking and not coming to me please do not come to me please leave the things on the floor we ll clean them up later
homework okay do you understand how okay so 7 12 is equal to 0.58 okay now can you compare those huh okay now all right which one is the biggest 3 fourths .75
compare let s look at our sentences is 3 4 greater than 7 12 look at your problem is 3 4 look at your decimals is 3 4 greater than 7 12 huh and is it also greater than half
no no right all right is 3 4 greater than one 2 look at your paper is 3 4 great your fractions is 3 4 greater than one 2 okay but it also has to be greater i m with a group you ll have to wait a minute
7 12 is that correct is one 2 so that 2nd part makes this one false right task you re waiting till i get done before you ask me a question 11 0 okay so it s going to be time to go to lunch
minute all right you guys have to finish correcting the paper okay after lunch we ll find one more that i can help you with okay all right just make sure you look everybody has to correct their paper okay and hopefully you re going to learn from these mistakes okay all right i like is finishing his gallon man too
m who s ready k who has the information i need to know yes it s blue it is blue because it is odd boys and girls we ve been doing this too far along in the school year for you not to tell me the 1st information i need to know everyday
79 it s blue because it is odd prime put the asterisk on top since i know it s prime is there anything else i need to do to this number
look all right so we ve got day 79 on prime
okay so my array when you have a prime number how many arrays do you have 79 equations give me equations please yours 158 divided by 2 k 9 times 8 is +7 equals 79
9 times 8 what did you say next 79 23 times 6 23 times 6 is 138
+one is 139 okay so that one s not correct r 10 times 8 take away 4 equals 49 more who has not given me an equation this week
7 12 times 6 is 72 +7 is 79 job remember we re going to go over the moon phase more tomorrow morning but anyone want to tell me what you saw last night what did you see last night
waxing gibbous so we re going to talk about that some more tomorrow
away i ve already written morning work up there so everyone should know 1st thing tomorrow morning i need everyone to 1st finish up that handwriting handout that deals with metaphors similes and then you need to finish your social studies and make sure your calendar for day 80 is done
right i want to go over yesterday s class work when we were comparing fractions
please has anyone not turned it in i believe yesterday by the afternoon everyone said they already had it turned in
yes yes
i gave you mine this morning all right okay number one we re comparing the fractions
number one should be 3 twelfths is less than 5 eighths okay they re going across
number 63 fifteenths is less than less than 13rd number 7622 is equal equal to 311s number 87 and 3 sevenths is what to 7 and 621 greater it is greater than
number 95 sixths is what to 5 eighths greater number 11 and 3 sevenths is what to one and 11 fourteenths less than number 114 and 7 twelfths compared to 4 and 3 eighths greater than let s make sure we re using the correct math terms please
there that whole number is telling you it s automatically greater than that fraction part part okay go ahead and write the number wrong on the person s paper
problems okay
if the person missed one it s a 942 is 883 is 814 is 755 is 696 is 637 is 56 hopefully i don t have to go further than that 94 all right instead of getting up right now you ll get to see your grades later
i just don t want you to have to bump into the camera at all let s go ahead and pass your papers down to the end of your row go ahead and get out of your seat and pass it to please go ahead and open up to a nice new clean page in your composition book
get it from and pass it on thank you yesterday boys and girls we talked about writing extra messages on people s papers
your job is to grade and put an x mark where i ve asked you to put an x nothing extra yesterday other people do not want to see your message to them them do we understand yes okay so let s get started on today s lesson
board adding like fractions
desk adding like fractions okay so before we get started with today s lesson let s write down what is like fractions what does that mean like fractions yes
something with the same denominator absolutely very good like fractions are fractions with the same denominator
okay you re not writing
part so let s do the steps now the steps of adding fractions
okay so before we start your 1st step is going to be to make sure fractions have the same denominator
then anyone want to take a guess yes add the top 2 numbers what are those numbers called please add together both numerators
okay then what after you have the answer for the numerator keep the same denominator absolutely
j keep the denominator the same okay yes what if the denominators are different that s not like fractions
our lesson is only adding like fractions so the denominators must be the same for you to even get started problem let s say we have 2 sevenths +3 sevenths do i have the same denominator
denominator so what do i need to do next denominator 5 sevenths it stays the same you do not add the denominators same please make sure you write this example on the notes as well
yes is it the same for subtraction we ll get to subtraction we re focusing on adding like fractions today all right good yes
example what if the denominators were getting larger like 6 over 21 +4 over 21 21 do we write that
you while you re waiting while classmates are finishing up open up your books to page 311
let me do one more example to make sure we cover this as well what if i had 13rd +2 thirds what do i get 3 thirds or just a one well 312 is better
go to 312 on page 312 i want you to do numbers 9 14
class you guys have about 5 minutes 5 or 7 minutes do we have to worry about the pictures it s up to you some people might use the pictures because it might help them or if you don t need to look at it just ignore it
problem how do you add the problem the problem is right underneath it honey
you have to write your problem if that s what you re asking because remember for tonight s homework we already wrote down row it says write the problem so right now i would like for you to write the problems as well just like we did in our notes it s pretty simple just like we did on our notes
9 14 shouldn t take you that long
on you re not drawing the picture write the problem
no well then you need to buy some more school supplies because it s unacceptable to be using a pencil that small what s taking so long let s go open just hold onto it
all right raise your hand if you re not done how many more
up what
mean don t worry about it k okay number 9 somebody read the answer and the problem m 18th +3 eighths equals 4 eighths very good
r 110th +4 tenths equals 5 tenths yep
n 4 sixths +3 sixths equals 7 sixths what can we do to the 7 sixths one and 16th whenever you have an improper fraction it needs to be simplified as one and 16th you need to write it as a mixed number
confused remember the whole lesson we ve done already that if you have a numerator that s bigger than the denominator that s an improper fraction and you ve got to turn it into a mixed number steps 6 goes into 71 time
one this is a whole number and the remainder is your numerator same you don t remember that lesson no honey this lesson was just last week and we did this lesson 2 or 3 days
it it s called mixed numbers to improper fractions and improper fractions to mixed numbers okay 7 sixths i m going to accept it this time because we didn t talk about making it into a mixed number but for tonight s homework and for your class work today i do want you to practice it the correct way
it s going to be okay right now but for your workbook page i want the final answer written as a mixed number okay c 2 sixths +4 sixths is is one whole one whole 6 over 6 equals one whole
h 3 fourths +2 fourths equals 5 fourths and what does 5 fourths equal one and 14th number 14
3 over 7 +4 over 7 equals 7 over 7 or one whole that is absolutely correct owner do we grade them
right you re going to have a graded assignment so if you did great that means you have a great chance to get 100 now take a look at the bottom where it s asking about algebra where it starts with 24 finding the missing number
today so 7 tenths +2 what gives you 9 tenths 2 tenths so the missing number is the 10
25 it says the answer is one whole it says find blank +3 blank equals one whole which is 8 excellent because over here you need to have 8 over 8 to equal one whole so you have to have the denominator be the same
the missing number is 8 okay let s take a look at the next one number 26 12 number 27 the missing denominators 9 on number 28 we re missing the numerators here one one and 114th +14th equals 2 fourths you can t have a 0 on top
m 6 fourths not 6 fourths it is 3 fourths okay let me show you why 3 eighths +3 eighths what does that equal
6 eighths but they have the answer written down as a 4 at the bottom so we had to figure out that missing number okay 8 divided by what got you 4 3 remember these are equivalent fractions all they did was called simplified and we re going to be talking about this some more
all right any other questions 31 is 11 so go ahead and open up your workbooks to page 80 for me
there what did you take my workbook no i did not take your workbook workbook page 80 and you do need to do all of them 24 28 it says rename each fraction as a mixed number
they have all improper fractions at the bottom 28 tear it out yes you can tear it out and turn this in
okay you need to get to work
hands did anyone miss more than 2 problems on 9 14 miss more than 2 problems 9 14 that we just did over together in class
yes 100 or missed one maybe can we still like same thing but remember does ms m want any of your answers as improper fractions no so if your numerator is bigger than your denominator you need to change those into mixed numbers
directions this needs to be equal and you need to do long division and see what it is notes number 14 do we just write the missing number do you know what the direction says
yes the answer is that doesn t make sense
4 is that what you have it what is this answer 3 +2 is what 6 3 +2 is 5
4 that is the answer you have to do equals correctly there s nothing in this trashcan
notes where are your notes wait turn mixed fractions into improper fractions
stay focused okay tell me how did you do this one 13 okay set i want you to write your improper fraction down 1st and then your mixed number
let s do for example number 3 together board did you find your class work from yesterday i don t understand where it s gone
okay number 33 fifths +4 fifths this is how i want you to do your work
attention 3 +4 is 7 5 what do i do with the denominator i just put 5 do i have some of you skipping this step and going automatically to a mixed number and your mixed numbers are wrong i need you to 1st do your improper fraction then do your equal sign again
divide 5 goes into 7 how many times time if you look at your notes this is your whole number 5 we subtract and you get 2
your remainder is your numerator and your denominator stays the same you guys we ve been practicing this too many days for you to pretend like you don t know what i m talking about
whole number is one leftover with 2 and your denominator stays the same so there s no excuse for anyone to have number 3 wrong if this is not how you ve been doing your work you need to fix it at the bottom of your paper you have more than enough space to do your division to show me your division for your mixed review
there what what s 6 +7
13 huh my denominator is 10
in please don t sit there like you have nothing to do every day during math i ve been watching you and i m going to start giving you a stay on task check for using your time wisely
do we divide when there s like 0
hold it up in front of the camera okay ms c was in here we talked about the order of operations yes it tells you what order you solve problems in especially problems that have more than one operation
t multiplication division addition and subtraction very good you can do all those things and sometimes you have to do more than one thing in one problem that is where we learned pemdas last week if you remember pemdas or please excuse my dear aunt sally you will know how to solve those problems who remembers why we crossed out excuse why did we cross it out
because we do not use it we do not use it yet but we know that the order please the p tells you we do what is in parenthesis 1st then we have my and dear multiplication and division hand how do i know which one to do 1st multiply or divide
how do i know which one to do 1st in a problem a whichever multiplication or division sign comes up 1st that is the one you are going to right just like you read you go left to right whichever one comes 1st from left to right you do that 1st so you do anything in parenthesis 1st regardless of operation
order after you have done all the multiplication and division you add or subtract right in your math journal i am going to show you one example together and then i am going to show you a game that you are going to use to practice today
remember you have to do them in a specific order go ahead and solve 30 -6 divided by 5 why do not you just use this one where is is does anybody have an extra pencil can use you that way you can get your work done too
when we have the 5 and the 6 do we still divide the 2 numbers separately wait i am looking at that problem and i think i might have copied it wrong because that is probably not going to work 3 you will not have remainders thank you
3 i was looking at it like 5 remember we just changed the 5 to a 3 sign i could not even see the dots can you see them now
no well it is division it i will write them bigger next time raise your hand to tell me what should i do 1st what are you going to do 1st what is in the parenthesis so you are going to do 30 -61st
23 check your subtraction i got 24 that what is 10 -6 4 so 30 -6 can not be 23
parenthesis next i have to bring down what i did not use 8 your final answer should have been 8 does that make sense
one you have to follow the steps in the order of operations to get it right if i do what i think is easiest 1st the answer is going to end up different one ready
steps it is 5 times 23 -18 +7
it looks really hard but if i follow my steps it will not be so bad
spot for those who are stuck raise your hand and tell me what should they do 1st and why m what are you doing 1st 5 times is that your order of operations
1st what is in parenthesis
18 do 23 -181st you will find out
quiet if you are wondering whether you are right or wrong you will see in just a minute when we do it together
where did you write it it here is how it looks when you solve it the 1st step you said was to do 23 -18 which was what 15 really 15
5 look where i had it parenthesis now i am going to bring down the 5 and the multiplication sign and the addition and the 7 all the things i have not done yet now looking at my order of operations do i multiply 1st or add 1st
5 i have not used that yet i am bringing that down i keep bringing that stuff back down and now i am left with 25 +7 which is 32 32 all right
operations make sure you have copied the work correctly 1st if you did not have it the 1st time game it is going to be fun yes i love this game it is like solving a problem can i erase this
game i have already told you you are going to play with your math groups we talked about it earlier today your group is going to get a deck of cards you are going to take out all of the wild cards all of the direction cards all of the kings
11 queens are 12 and i am doing it that way so you are only using your basic facts okay does everybody understand yes you are taking out all of the jokers all the wild cards all the directions all the blank cards and all the kings you are only keeping all the number cards and the aces jacks and queens does that make sense
yes it would be easier though if we could get through the directions order i am going to start by pulling out one number one card and i have got a queen which i know is 12 12 that is going to be my target number
my target number is going to be the answer i want to get when i am finished more i am pulling out a 10 no wait
here i am pulling out a 10 a jack which is 11 another queen i guess they did not mix these very well which is a 12 side a 3 and a 5
my goal is to use these numbers to get the number 12 i want to use as many numbers as i can to come up with the answer of 12 i am going to remember the order of operations when i do it so i know how to solve the problem see i want to make the number 12
with i could start with let us say i start with 3 times 5 i have used these numbers what are you going to subtract 12 11
okay i have a 4 but i still have a 10 and a 12 and i am trying to get to 12 in your books i am going to try you are going to try to see i want you to try to use addition and subtraction and multiplication division all of those operations to try to get your answer to equal 12
however you have to use 10 11 12 3 and 5 in the problem itself okay you may work with the people you are sitting by if you are still confused and need help and i am going to try to work it out up here you understand out do you understand then help your group
group and do you guys understand what you are trying to do together you are on your own buddy try
together you are working on math not drawing pictures
using all the numbers how many numbers did you use look you are trying to make the number 12 you are making a problem 12 is your target number 12 -11 is one
okay watch you can not use 11 twice you can only use it once i was thinking if i started with 12 times 3 what is 12 times 3
to what is 12 times 3 36 so i need to use the numbers 10 11 12 3 and 5
3 it is 36 far i am going to cross them out because i have used them now what i am trying to decide is how can i get all the way to 12 36 what if i take away 4 is there something else i can add subtract multiply or divide -11
11 what is 36 -11
5 okay so i have a 10 and a 5 left now i have a 5 and a 10 left am i going to be able to get the number 12 with those numbers left
it i am trying to figure out what these numbers mean when i am done the answer is going to be 12 20 all i have left is a 10 10 i mean 12
now you are trying to figure out what to do with those numbers to make the answer 12 think go ahead together do you guys have it we have it
what are you going to do from here to here did 10 +5 equals 15 -3 equals 12
do this watch 15 -3
15 -3 12 now is yours an example you guys some of you are still working to let me show you how it works because i think some of you might be confused and you can use parenthesis more than once in a problem
and came up with one way to solve it you they did this watch my goal is to use as many of these numbers as possible to make the number 12 the answer 12 the 1st person to be able to do that correctly using the most numbers gets the point for that round the one that wins that round
this they took 12 -11 and they put that in parenthesis then they put a multiplication sign and they did 10 +5 now they have used 12 11 10 and 5
there 12 -11 15 why did i do those 2 things 1st 1st now i am going to bring down everything i have not used
i did not use this multiplication sign or minus either now what do i do next in the order of operations 15 15 -3
yes i am trying to use these numbers in some way that i end up with my target number as the answer some of you will use all of them some problems you can not use every number is that how you played you used just the face cards up to 12 ways we are going to work on it
so you are going to work on this with your math group that it is called target number do when you go to your group you need your pencil and your math journal
i will give one deck of cards to your group you are going to choose one target number 1st then 5 additional cards no you used different numbers use i used 12 -10
10 yeah okay equals 2 +10 equals 12 twice you can only use it one time because it is only up there one time sense that would work but you can only use that number one time all right if you are in group one you are going to work with ms
cards group 2 you are going to work with me at the back table group 3 you are going to work over here at the side and group 4 you are going to work back here
front group 3 group 2 is with me at the back table
ms r is not allowed to be on the video so when his group goes they are going to have to be in the back if it comes up twice you can use it twice but only if it shows up twice
here group 4 you guys are moving up to the front groups okay you guys
ready make a line small instead of using 5 cards let us use 3 okay
these some of them i noticed some of the cards are not in their packages anymore okay okay let us start with our target number
we are going to start with the top of the game face on your book top okay get we used 3 cards this time just to get us started
okay we have queen which is 12 so 12 is the 1st number we need to use we have another 12 so 212s it we are not going to be able to make 8 with 312s
side that is the 12 11 i do not know if we will be able to do it 12 12 4 11
numbers we need to figure out how to put these numbers together in a big math problem to make the answer 8 okay i want you to girls are going to work together and boys are going to work together
doing i want to see if you can make the answer 8 using what you have got go ahead
wait when you are writing i am watching what you are doing when you are writing you start with 12 -11 and you get one
you are trying to figure out what would go with one if you are trying to get to 8 12 what you need to do in the next row is put +12 and 13 mean that way you are sure you are adding the rest of the problem until you end up with the number at the end 12s you have only used 212s
twice you have 12 and 4 left it is hard what do you have left 11 24 are you going to add subtract multiply divide subtract okay
put a minus sign right here 48 -24
works watch look if you knew that 12 -4 is 8 because what is all right you did 12 -4 and 12 -11 is what is 8 times one
okay does that equal 8 one okay
look look what started by saying 12 take away 4 is 8 which is right one 8 times one is did he use all the numbers
no is there a way to use this 12 in there number if you want to try to for now i just want you to get used to using the order of operations
sense go ahead and copy everything that we have done and again you don t have to use every single number but as many as you can bless you
is you have to use the most numbers
yes all right let us try another one ready here is my target number this time 4
numbers you can work with your partner again this time i want you to try to use as many of these numbers as you can to end up with the answer 4 digits i am with a group right now
your group is going to have to solve your problem gentlemen if you can not handle this you can go back to your seat and i can give you some work in the book
numbers i want you to try to do it quietly so we are not interrupting the people near us
4 you can not do 3 -6 and 3 -3 right put that in parenthesis you used 3 and 6
use how can you use your 4 3 and 4 6 -3 is not one it what could you put there that would equal one 2 look at the numbers you have left
how can you use any combination of these numbers to make one there okay right now is using 4 numbers
let me see what you are working on what is 10 -4 now i want you to try something else
else i do not have an answer i have to solve it just like you do
with 4 digits or 54 i am trying to think and you guys have what is in my mind when i 1st looked at it i was like i have it back i have it
numbers we use that the big one no you can only use these 5 digits to equal it us 6 +3 is 9
4 you should have the parenthesis you have 9 -5 -4 have 9 -6
9 -4 is 5 wait you had 6 2 3 and 6 see what did you do you did 6 +3 is 9
next it is 5 then what
subtract 6 +3 equals 9 -4 equals 5 +2 equals 7 -3 equals 4 wait i got tripped up on 9 -4
you 6 +3 equals 9 9 -4 equals 5 and 5 +2 equals 7 2 7 -3 equals 4
look if he writes the problem like this 6 +3 let us say 6 +3 gives us 9 9 -4 is 5 5 +2 gave him 7 7 -3 gave him 4 you have to do it in the order he gave you because it is the order of operations you start with the parenthesis you have to do it in the order of operations
because it has to be done in a specific order everything in parenthesis gets done 1st then all addition and subtraction from left to right very good job for that round because even though you guys had an answer 1st he was able to use every number does that make sense
all right i am going to let you guys go off and try it on your own cards you guys are playing as a whole group i will have another group come over is in charge of the cards
them group 4 come on back with me you you can do this group 4 come on back
cards you don t have a whole lot of time
how many rounds do you have and i am waiting for the cards when you go back these are all the ones you are not using
journal i want to see your thinking when you are solving these remember you guys in groups you are working quietly what we need to work on in your practice is how you are writing it
you have to write it as an equation so i know what you are doing 1st hence the order of operations but if you can get the answer right group one you guys can stay right where you are
number 12 is your target number use i did not tell you yet i do not know why this card was in that other pack
ready 11 8 12 4 11 3 and 9 you are trying to make the number 12 using just how many numbers
2 i want you to use more than 2 hard it could be but it is also fun
it is hard if you do not know your facts but if you know your facts it is like a puzzle trying to piece it together to get a specific number me keep going you have to write it down to figure it out
watch that is what it should look like you guys all need to be on the floor that is very good is writing it as an operation the whole time
time gentlemen i am not sure what it is you are doing but i am sure your parents would be embarrassed to find out work what if we use 3 cards
you can but you want to try to use all of them think you do
too just give me 12nd i want you to try to use more than that
more keep working focus and remember 1st you are doing what is in parenthesis 1st okay then you are doing the order of operations addition and subtraction from left to right
so it is going to be 12 -8 whatever that answer is +4
i like the way is thinking about it
it it is still only 3 digits try to use more than 3 all right your problem actually looks like that
11 -8 is then 3 +9 is 12
3 see if you can use more than 3
guys you have not written any solutions down yet
1st i used 9 +3 equals 12 -11 equals one +8 equals 9 i used 2 numbers has done this 11 -8 which is 3 3 +9 is that is one way
he is used 11 8 and 9 done that is not going to work will you have 12 times one
way you are on the right track starting with 20 minus that is 8 -4 okay what is 20 -4 you are left with the 3
decide when you are trying to get to 12 can you get from 6 to 3 to 12 what if you had done 20 and made this instead of 8 -4 what if you used a different number in here like 8 -3 to get 5
worked i used 9 +11 equals 20 -8 equals 12 numbers 4 12 -4 is 8 not 7
guys see if tonight when you go home you can make this using all 5 numbers okay solving it is easier than making it but making it is like a puzzle you guys i would like you to show me where you are where you are which means you are not getting up and walking away
the purpose of this game is to make you actually think you are thinking about addition subtraction multiplication division you are thinking about your basic facts but you are also thinking about there is a certain order in which you complete problems
operations tonight for homework i am going to give you some practice just using order of operations not this game but whatever round you are on in your notebook write down your target number and the 5 numbers you are using in your equation and see if you can use all 5 numbers to make your answer okay quietly start cleaning up
376 reduce identify reduce what identify the definition of reduce
mean okay smaller well what can you tell me about these numbers this product this example it is it multiplication is it addition
it fraction it s a fraction go reduce it
it excellent and 2nd make you guys stars of the day
correct why did you choose 2 fifths because if you divide 25 by 5 it equals 5 and 10 divided by 5 is 2 okay so why did you choose half because 9 is a half of 18
people a car holds 110th as many it go ahead go for it girl 3rd star of the day
really the bus holds 40 people many that would lead you to believe that it could be a division problem many how many people does the car hold
because nice and loud because by 10 so 10 can evenly go into 40 how many times thought is there another way to solve this
how 4 times go do it
it as long as you come up with this answer and you can prove why you used that thought it s not wrong you have to prove your answer you have to prove why and how thought what s your information what s your information in the problem
go really information okay
plan does it work
out by working it out she showed to herself addition isn t a solution it now thought that if she added and did repeated addition it would work out to be a 4
but it couldn t because if she did repeated addition with the 10s she would get 40 and that s not 4 repeated addition with 40 that wouldn t give her 4 so addition clearly was not a product but she didn t realize it until she actually went through the process
4 yes questions come on guys up i know it s a cloudy thursday but you still got to wake up yes i know
could you put all your stuff away please sweetheart you re doing your long comp that you missed out on
could you please do me a favor and erase everything check in
now please clear off your desks please put your names on this paper did you get anything for your headache yeah put your glasses on
bag record how many of each color cube are in your bag prediction again define
prediction it s a funny word but what is a prediction a guess so a prediction is based on probability probability
prediction how many times do you think you will pull a red cube out of the bag if you have one red cube in a bag and you have 10 blue cubes let s predict are you going to pull a red cube out every single time no what are the chances of pulling a red cube or a blue cube out
okay so what do you think you re going to pull out most of the times why because okay trial boys and girls i have set here bags
game you re not going to fight this we practiced this last week and we ve done a little bit of this you re going to pull out how many times do you think we should do it each so each partner gets to do 5 pulls 1st thing you need to do and can join you guys
15 you guys are going to do 10 times the 1st thing direction on this paper is to do what record how many are in your bag what does it mean to record
1st very good you guys are going to get to do 155 each unless of course wait a minute yeah you need to come over here and sit unless the girls want to do it do you want to work just with
work all right so you girls can do 15 honorable is a nice partner excuse me
all right boys and girls the girls team back there is going to pull each person is going to pull how many times
go you have about 5 minutes to do it
the 1st thing you have to do predict how many times do you think before you start pulling what do you need to do
you need to predict predict make a prediction what can you base your prediction on what can you base your prediction on
how many how many colors you got different yep you can start
that s right when you pull it out you have to put it back in
don t forget you have to have the same amount yes
same you re getting 15 tallies yes your prediction can be different pocket you need to put it in your backpack and you re working with this team
you i thought i explained to plenty can you put your cell phone in your backpack please are we working as a group no r we need to start then those 3 are working together great group over here
great group over there wonderful job you please when missus c comes on the intercom we re making a lot of noises with the paper so i just want to make sure we freeze so they can hear because they re farther away from the intercom than we are okay
continue quickly good we re waiting for one group to continue
minutes you have to put the red one back in in order to have the data correct
thank you how many more times do you guys have to go
11 more time around you guys are doing a great job waiting you you can be reading and looking at the next you know total the number of cubes
marks put a total there good 4 count how many reds you have and put the number on number 4
over now this one says how many red cubes did you draw in 50 trials different the 1st one i only had you do 10 to get used to it this one here did the number you got surprise you
expected look at the class line plot what do you notice about the data for experiment number 3 what do you notice when you compare the results from the 3 experiments partner now you re going to do the exact same thing again
it 5050 if you have 3 people you re still only drawing 50 continue i know i know okay i want you now after you re done
sheet so i m going to use for a 2nd down this data stays the same now she s going to make a new prediction
so right now on your paper i would like you to draw a line here and here because this was 10 times or 15 times if you were working in another group now you re going to see what the data changes when you do 50 times
it you re now making a prediction to see do you think it s going to be about the same data we re doing 50 times so now you re going to do 50 times if you are in a group of 3 you re still only doing 50 this should take you about 10 minutes
okay okay
so do it that way
if your bag s collapsing you can open it up a little bit
i m looking to see which groups are going to get the credits you guys are doing a great job over here
well teacher yes dear sorry you ll see
ah that s interesting interesting question i like your question reds write it way at the bottom
okay but you are about halfway done question i want you to look and see if you and your partner can come up with a question and write your question on the bottom of your paper to answer at the end of this experiment something to do with probability it could be can you share your question with the class
what s up with all these reds he wants to know why he keeps getting red question to be answered at the end of your experiment
down you need to converse with and or write your own acceptable but you have to solve them together as partners ask him
he s your partner as soon as you have written down your question as soon as you have written down your question you and your partner either your own or a joined question with your partner or partners so you can have either one question amongst your group or 2 separate ones
experiment great group over here
much better i m glad you re feeling better
good
mark 0
are you and done
when you re done you can go on to answer this question and that question question 7 and 8
8 i ll give you paper you must put your name and my name and the date on this paper
it we got 42 that s okay i need this too you do have the paper boys and girls
yesterday do you remember the paper we did yesterday it yeah this is for something else we re going to be doing you don t know what it is yet so don t write on it except for your name
0 yeah name i asked you not to throw it out i told you to keep it cause you re going to need it for today it if you don t have it you may have to write the questions on a separate piece of paper
good you were absent honey no she was was here you go sweetie there s always some reasoning to my madness you ll need it
where s our bag it s over here are you guys done almost are you done it you are going to answer 7 and 8 yes answer 7 and 8
you guys done i m sorry what right over there when you girls are done would you put it over there on the shelf yes
one you ll have to copy it down cause i need that one up there you can look too yes me and what you can go get it
all right 54321 i don t think it s there you re going to have to copy em
questions nice listening over here here okay at this time you are writing down your data
you re also going to did the number you got surprise you why and then you have a question that you wrote down on your paper that you need to answer as well
together so answer 7 and 8
okay boys and girls if you do not have this paper from yesterday i asked you to keep it in your desk if you don t have that paper excuse me
it no too let s go guys yes yeah and i m microphoned 0 okay
i was just going to say i wanted to i was going to ask you which one of the students no they re all in the office with the and everything everything is up there okay yeah they re all up there actually in a blue thing
yeah it s all done up there from the looks of it it looks like you re all done with 7 and 8 job don t do 9 and 10 10 you are doing 7 8 and the question that you asked yourself
microphone 0 so they hear what you re saying and what you re saying 0 r i mean you re always well behaved and this is how i usually conduct it when we are doing it s nothing different than what you re used to right no
work yeah so just be yourselves it s fine you don t need to do anything go it looks like that group s done because is sitting with his hands folded done would you put the bag over on the shelf please okay okay
good this group is done plot what do you notice about the data in this well 1st of all we don t have one
pink these can keep your things into the proper rows a line plot can a line plot be horizontal yes think what a line plot is
can a line plot be horizontal yes all right can it be vertical yes a line plot does it work better vertically or horizontally vertically vertically what can a line plot then be made into a bar graph a bar graph can a bar graph be horizontal and vertical yes
can it ever be diagonal diagonal diagonal thank you can it ever be used as a graph can you use this data for a graph it depends it depends it depends if you re doing a percentages of how many times is a whole times did you pull out a red 50 full amount of time
be maybe you pulled out a red 30% of the time so the data can be made into different graphs what they asked us to do is to create a line plot based on the class data guys have we done a lot of work on graphing
yes do you guys know how to do line plot graphs yes do you know how to set up graphs yes are you comfortable with graphs are you working with a partner
need data data so we need the class data up at the top you are not going to write gigantic because this is going to be your graph we re going to get class data red yes look at the question
me look at the class what do you notice about the data so it would be really lopsided if we only did red because what color cubes have you used what the total and the data of red and blue
so let s do red cubes 1st
3 could you tell me and this is out of 50 trials out of 50 times how many red cubes did your 2 partners and you pull out
35 how many did your team pull out 31 how about and
how many red cubes 20 31 34
5 out of 50 trials 30 what 30
33 thank you for the correction speak up
35 why do i smell popcorn me too all right now no equal you re doing a line plot these think in your team
you she s very good at graphs is very good at graphs why we re not equaling them i m just putting the numbers up there i might ask for it afterwards so you want to write it like that because there s multiple steps to this one experiment
71 wow
26 well that s what i want to know i also want to know about the 5 so we re going to investigate that afterwards
hear i m sorry 19
25 all right how many did they have 86
information this is your data data copy it data that is how i did it up in the left hand corner
thing sideways hm yes data we have computer lab in about 10 minutes so needless to say we re going to have to finish up after when we come back
tomorrow this has been a whole week process of getting you even here no you guys have to get tested in your addition subtraction multiplication division sorry
one it might be a why don t you go blow your nose wash your hands do no
is doing a fine job done he s listening he s right on task is reminding him of things that they might forget to do
team i m actually going to put db cl
i m looking for groups that are really working very well together
task see who s going to get the final cross plus i know that and are all done because their hands are folded done that group is almost all done
nice this is a multi step thing you i like how are helping each other explain needed help was right there to help them they re a very good team
d okay all right what does every graph need data well we got data
need because without data you wouldn t have a graph a title a title so do you have your title make your title talk to your partner 1st you need your title get your title talk to your partner come up with a title
what are you graphing talk to your partner please matter the title will help explain what these numbers are okay
2345678910
title the cube cycle the cube cycle okay bag 2 color cubes red and blue 2 color cubes red and blue it tells the colors it tells the object it has the subject it has the description yes 50 trials of red and blue 50 trials of red and blue
cubes red and blue cubes grabbed thunder cubes thunder cubes the dark cube what does that have to do with it s not dark colors
graph how about dark grabbed cube graph what because you were grabbing them all right now did okay you have your title
red what is the range of numbers red ah
so how high must your numbers go 35 it has to go to 35 and higher okay so we know that what is your blue range
giggles 1515 does that change your number line
45 it has to start at under well i would start at 0 side to make it look nice and clean and sweet what should your number line go to at 5 really one
50 i like 0 to 50 because that covers everything you don t have to make it that big i guess if i were you i would figure out right now don t do anything yet because we go to computer lab have 2 what are your categories
red and blue cubes okay red and blue the word cube should be up here somewhere so we know cubes it could be red and blue aliens apples it could red and blue lollipops we don t know what the red and blue is unless you include the cube
title you must have that in there 9 30 i did not tell anyone to move lab so i m going to take this off but after i line you all up
down can i have this group get up and walk this way door can i have this group do the same thing you have to be extremely careful because i m not going to have you get up yet
go exactly so i m going to have you get up 1st okay can you get out too honey and i m just going to ask you to move yours up
let s go
okay we re going to continue working with our hands on equation stuff today and we re going to start we are all going to do a couple problems together ones and for some of us these are going to feel really easy because we ve started to get the hang of things and we don t feel like we need a whole lot more practice okay
so you re just going to do these 3 and you re just going to let it be like a warm up for your brain okay some of us might need these 3 warm up problems because some of us haven t done these hands on equation problems since last week okay some of us did a few problems the other day but some of us it s been a little while so we re going to start off easy easy and then get a little bit more complicated
you may know the answer right off when you look at what i write on the board but i still want you to make the problem on your scale okay and then you re showing me with your hand when you think you know what the x equals
ready okay this is your 1st problem no hands are going up because you re making it 1st
page think back
mean times it means blue piece right or a white piece okay let s pause before i ask you what the actual answer is
what do we use in place of the x when we re making our scale on our desk x these things your little pawns right either your blue or your white piece how many x s do i have on this side of my scale
22 so if i m doing it on mine there s my 2 x i have 2 x s what goes on the other side of my scale 1010 there we go
10 okay now i m trying to figure out if 2 x s equals 10 then how can i figure out what one x equals you said you knew right
out 7 times 2 i knew it was half and 10 s an equal number so okay in case y all couldn t hear him that was a very good answer
d he said well when you think of 2 s he said it makes me think of half and i knew that half of 2 would be 5 how would i check this if i had the worksheet in front of me and if i had to show my work and prove that x equals 5 how do i go back and check this
i was going to say that you can do 10 divided by 2 i could do 10 divided by 2 that equals . 55 what else could i show to check
5 times 2 or 2 times 5 equals 10 or 5 plus plug in 5 s right here and show that 2 times 5 or 5 +5 equals 10
pieces we need a bunch of pieces to make our scale match up
3 x +5 is on one side and it s equal to 4 x +2 it i am
okay we re only using x s so we want all the same color to show that they re the same thing this okay but that 3 doesn t mean the number 3
mean it means three . times times something three . times something x s right remember when the 3 is in front of our x it s telling us how many x s we have
of x s plus what number 5 okay add a 5 over here with your 3 x s side 4 the number 420
okay before you tell me your answer i need you to help me make my scale all right i m going to start on this side exactly what pieces do i need to put for this side of the scale you could say 3 blues are white okay 3 blues are white
so i m going to have blues so that equals my 3 x and what else do i need here s my number 5 so i ve got 3 x +5 what do i need to put on this side
you need to put 4 blue white piece no you need to put 4 blues okay a 24 blues and a what number and a 2 okay somebody remind me i don t want the answer yet why is it important for me to have the same color
why would i want to have if i m going to use blues over here why would i want to make sure that i have blues over here too z because if the other side if you put a number it has to be the same on the other side how do you know it has to be the same right what do you think
0 i thought because when your total x s it has to be the same because they will think that s 5 and then that s a 2 it has to equal the same total okay so we do know that because of this equal sign in the middle we re trying to balance out our equation
sides but what letter did i use on both sides x well if i m using the same letter on both sides then that means it has to equal the same number on both sides right okay our hands don t need to be on our pieces right now cause when i m trying to hear friends share their ideas i m hearing the click and the clank and the noise of our pieces
that s why we already have them ducked out on our desk okay okay now it s time for me to look at this complicated scale and figure out how can i make it simpler what can i do to figure out i need to know what one of those blue pieces equals
well i guessed the okay is guessing and checking a strategy that we can sometimes use to solve a problem yeah okay did somebody else look at this and do something different do okay
n what did you get
4 i was doing times 2 and 3 times 3 is so is 4 still going to work so close do i did 3 okay how did you get 3
do at 1st i did the easiest thing to do i took off 3 on each side okay took off 3 what thingies pawns yeah 3 x s you took away 3 x s right okay explain to me why it s okay to take these off and then take these off because it makes it easier to figure out it makes it easier to figure out
now would it be okay for me to take 3 off over here and then all 4 off on this side not because then you wouldn t know any extras would this still be even no and that equals 5 it s equal right now flat and for me to keep it completely flat if i take one off here i got to take one off here
if i m going to take one off here i got to take one off here one off here one off here so now has simplified her problem down so that she s got 5 on one side now one just one x +2
problem yes blank +2 equals 53 we re going to get the same answer it s just a different way of solving it it s a different okay clear off your scale
where did our 6 come from 0 is this your 5 yeah and you have your 3 x and do you have that 1st x go now on this side you ve got your 11 plus your 2 x equals your x perfect so i don t now you re done
mind do you have this one x s yeah where s your scale show me
scale this sides perfect do i just okay so on this side you re going to have to figure out how you want to do your 11 it okay let s give other people just a minute or 2
think since there s 2 different colors do all of these have tell me how many x s do we have over here here 0 i need one yep take that one away
now we ve got our 5 if you have different colors do they have to equal the same well they need to be the same color cause all those x s are the same number so if you re going to use whites you want to make them all white side x +5 you ve got an x +5 +3 x
yeah you have 3 x s don t touch this side side just pick one color
3 x okay so if that s my 3 x then where s the other x s by itself
mean so that one should be the blue one +3 more p 44 there you go okay before we solve i need somebody to help me make this happen on my scale
visual i need the hands on and i need to see it because this is difficult for me to sort through side what do i need to put over here on my scale
4 x s how did you get 4 x s because i don t see 4 x written up there because it says one x 1st and then at the end it says 3 x s so one x +3 more x s perfect what else do i need 5 number 5 perfect all right who can help me out with this 5 as my scale
can you tell me what i need one x okay one x then what 2 more then i need 2 more x s and then what 11 and i m going to make my 11 by putting up the number 10 and the one
and that works too as long as you know it s 11 okay what do i do to figure out what the x s equal i have a lot of stuff on my scale your scale should look like mine
do take away what i did was i took away 3 on each side so these are going to like a number 3 no i took away 3 x s on each side and so i ended up with 11 on that side and 5 x and one x on one side and so i m thinking that 5 +6 is 11
took away 3 x s and this is what he ended up with 1166 let s plug it in and make sure because we always want to check when we do this kind of math
all right so let s put 6 +5 +and this is like 3 times 6
equal who can do that math what s it equal 6 +5 equals 11 +11 +18 equals 29 good okay so this side equals 29
equals 2929 all right 6 +11 +2 times 6 v 126 +11 equals 17 +12 equals 29 do they both equal the same thing
are 29 equals 29 okay listen carefully pieces you are free to make as much noise as you need to moving your pieces around in a few minutes but while i m talking hands off
okay some of you got this page on monday you got up from the red rug and you pulled out hands on equations and you are working on one side said lesson 3 the other side said lesson 4 i don t believe any of you go this finished
so you re pulling this out and you re working on it if you didn t start this on monday then i need to see your hand so that i can bring you this page listen you may work with someone sitting around you but it needs to be someone that if you re just now getting this page you re working with someone who s just now getting this page
if you finish this page you have to bring it to me for me to check if on monday you were working with me on the red rug most of the time you didn t get one of these or if you were doing highest lowest quotient you didn t get one
you you have one already one we did the other one for this i thought it was the same one do you need one do you need one
i had one i had like 2 questions left and i d look a little harder then before i have to start all over
i remember doing this one monday some of them might look similar but if you didn t get this on monday then it was a different page
okay you doing this one so on this side we ve got on this side we ve got what
x s plus where s my 7 right there side okay what can we take away on both sides to make this a lot easier
5 how many all what does an x equal 5 now you ve got to do the math to prove it to me
3 times 7 +7 equals what right yeah but that s not cause that s less than 10
4 i know this one starts with +and 5 which means our other one somewhere else
yay this is lesson 3 those are all your x answers there s lesson 4 all your x answers check them see how you did check yep
this is where you prove it to me that 3 times 7 +7 is the same thing as 4 times 70 you remember okay and how would you do checks because i just did that thing where i go one by one by one and then i get 2 then i get 3 what would i do
that s how i get my answers okay but now you ve got to prove it to me do whoa i think okay put that in the finished work basket they re harder
m okay you ve got to prove to me that 3 times 7 +7 equals 4 times 7 that s when you plug in your 7 over here for the x and you show me the math sentence okay that means 3 times 7 right
+7 equals 4 times 7 me i need some help too okay that s not a question on thanks check your work
answers lesson 4 those are your answers okay did you make it on your scale on i m really not sure how to okay this makes me wonder if you were listening
do what s a quick easy way to automatically make this a whole lot simpler i thought about it i can t think of the right words to remember go get the sheet from and check i didn t think was an equal number put them back finished
harder it s okay take one away from each side take another one away take another one away what s wrong with that it s not equal yes it is
side that s equal 0 you can do that yeah as long as every time i took one away from here i took one away from this side that i thought there had to be at least one x on each side in fact this is when it makes it even easier because what do you know x equals 7 yeah wasn t that simple
okay when you check that s when you prove it to me over here by showing me that 3 times 7 +7 times 7 +7 equals what
me 28 did you solve that number sentence do the math i m a little confused about cause this is one of this is fine you re jumping ahead of yourself okay all right new one
me i got the 1st one 7 14 +14 is 28 and then i already have one 7 so then that equals 3 more 7s good do number 2 okay you re showing me that they both end up equaling the same right
there okay okay 3 x s plus your 2 x +2 simpler okay can we take anything else away
me they re distracting you yes me too okay well then get those off our scale here 2 and then how many x s do we have 2 so there s a number that we add together twice and then we add 2 and it totals up to 10
is i don t understand this there 4 you made it on your scale okay i ll be right there 4 okay i m coming that 8 +2 equals 104 times 2 is 8 and 8 +2 is 10
perfect the math you just told me is what you write in right there d okay make this one on your scale i mean it was just so weird as soon as you lost all this good stuff what s wrong
did you make it on your scale try number 3 and i ll come back and check basket this one gets harder
yes here 2 or here well you have a 2 this 2 right mean 2 times 2 x s there you go
and now what s going to be on this side 1010 there you go okay see what you can take away and then this one you ve got to figure out some math too
here take it off here huh 2 times is 2 is . okay 2 plus something plus something equals 10
in 0 +0 +0 yeah it does fit yeah okay what are we stuck on
number 4 i mean we set it up but . okay is there something we can take away leave your stuff right where it is okay freeze friends we are let for specials
let s go
it record all right everyone action
guys 144 divide by 12126 times 9549 times 981 what type of a number is 81 it s a square number and what else 81 it s odd
odd because it ends in a okay but it ends with a one and you can t split it okay all right so today we re going to continue our work with decimals okay
decimals we re going to add solve problems that require decimal addition and subtraction okay so you have the same problem on page 8 of your paper
me go ahead sally jane and her friend buy at quick shop they picked out a bag of for ¢89 and a half gallon of cider for one.97
the cash register in the express land is broken do you agree it s not wrong probably did wrong okay what i want you to do is i want you to turn and talk with the person sitting next to you okay i want you to think about the question do you agree with the clerk okay
and if not explain what the clerk probably did wrong okay minutes you can use your journal to figure it out you i want you to think about the question do you agree okay that the bill should be $10.87 okay
and if not explain what the clerk probably did wrong so you really have to put some thought into it and really think about what s going on in the problem everyone yes that happens to me all the time when i go to stop n shop all right that happens to me too that happens to you as well
you have a discussion about what do you think do you agree and explain if not explain what the clerk probably did wrong okay do okay over here talk that s go and and ..
you and . n we still having problem communicating with each other this is december everyone let s have a conversation you can talk to each other all 3 of you
you want to join this conversation j move your seat he s not going to bite come on move your seat he s actually a really nice person to work with
we re working on that right we re working on okay so that s what matters as long as we re moving forward here we re having a conversation yeah okay so what do you think here this is the situation 0 i m reading the wrong 0 let s go situation good the right page he said $10.87 and it was only like . it was just one.97 and the other one had no
had no dollars except for just ¢89 how are we supposed to know how much money they have so what s going on with the 2 of you
it okay what did you discuss do you agree do you agree yes no no so you disagree so you disagree okay so why
because . you had a discussion you said okay then what did you discuss okay so . okay so it s but okay do you agree
explain did that s right he might have added too much taxes or 0 wait point this is
taxes or he might have like done like he might have not known how much the bag of pretzels cost well he knew because how much is a pretzel ¢8089 so that s up so what do you think up that what do you think
please i do not agree okay then you need to sit up
why . why they charged them for a higher price why do you think that is looking at the number what do you think the clerk got the $10.87 looking at the price of the pretzel and the price of the cider where do you think . i m . i can add what they bought together and it equals $4 and . 80 . 90 ..
so you re saying that if you add okay so if you add the 2 items together it s about . it s about what like around $3 okay so what do you think the clerk did that was wrong $10.87 that s the question you have to think about okay
discuss what do you think the clerk did wrong he could have . how what do you think the clerk got the $10.87 that s the question he kind of did the he did that what do you mean say that again
since there s a one right here and there s right here he could have made that as a 10 and then he could have did so you re thinking that he . he the clerk thought that the pretzel cost $10 in change instead of ¢89 no he might have thought that this was $10 okay so what do you and he rounded that down so what do you think what do you think
i think that the clerk . he rounded wrong he what he rounded wrong okay so he rounded the numbers incorrectly okay so which number do you think he rounded incorrectly the 89 the ¢89 what do you think he rounded the ¢89 to
number $9 okay so everyone listen yeah okay again everyone listen i think that the turn and talk everyone we ve been doing that since september
stop you guys need to learn to work with each other okay in this world you have to work with people that you may not like okay now you re being graded for class participation okay all right so sally and jane and her friend z buy snacks at a quick shop
they got a bag of pretzels for ¢89 and half gallon of cider for one.97 the cash register in the express lane is broken and the clerk says the bill before taxes is $10.87
if you were a 5th grader in teacher g s classroom i know you re not going to pull out $10.87 and give to the clerk if you are a 5th grader in teacher g s classroom and we ve been adding and subtracting decimals you re going to and we ve been estimating decimals you re going to say that s wrong $10.87 do you agree wrong so who would like to answer that again you ve discussed this with the person sitting next to you
again do you agree if not explain what the clerk probably did wrong so we re going to have some ideas you re going to listen to each other okay and we re going to listen to each other it s really important sit up please
so it s really important that you listen to each other so that when it s your turn to speak you are not repeating verbatim what somebody else has said okay you are either agreeing disagreeing or adding information
w . i think okay 1st of all do you agree no no okay so if you do not agree what . what did the clerk do wrong he i think that he put the one and the 0 together and made it $10 plus the tax okay remember it says before taxes so that means that the clerk did not add the tax
attention we put the timer we made the one and the 0 okay all right so you think that the clerk put the one and the 0 together okay what and then i don t know what he did with the change but okay so everyone listen
is saying the clerk probably because i m thinking that the clerk the cash register is broken so you have a customer in front of you right so now he probably he or she probably put the one with the 10 with the 0 okay
what i don t know what the clerk did with the ¢89 and the ¢97 okay idea any other ideas what are you thinking
hand everyone is paying attention sit up everyone sit up straight please go ahead what do you think okay
he added wrong okay said he added wrong what did he add that s incorrect the . so what do you think incorrectly tell me what you re thinking and i will write it down
so i m going to write the 1st item is ¢89 so i m going to write ¢89 okay
 one.97 what do you anyone one.97 so said you know what i think the clerk added incorrectly so we started with ¢89
it he labeled the . go ahead he labeled the . go ahead yes he labeled the wrong he labeled the price wrong what do you mean by that like he didn t put it in the right spot he didn t put what in the right spot
here 0 like he didn t can you come up and show me why what you re thinking everyone is paying attention and listening what do you mean he didn t put it in the right spot he put it right no no no
think let s continue from that he put . he put . okay go ahead
okay you can sit down okay this is what is thinking s thinking you know what the clerk probably added incorrectly so he has ¢89 right here is you see where the 0 is all right and is saying you know what
written what who can finish that thought n he didn t line up the decimals okay so he didn t line up the decimals so what would you have done correctly he didn t line up the decimal
the clerk didn t line up the decimal so what do you think he the clerk did though how did the clerk get this amount the $10 both they didn t line up the decimal but what is the clerk thinking
x i think he multiplied the . the times multiplied it by 5 multiplied it by you think he the clerk did all of that at the register okay so is saying that the clerk added the 2 numbers and then multiplied the answer by 5
thought okay all right so you agree here ah maybe the clerk go ahead sunset okay the clerk okay i hear a new word the clerk did not line up the numbers by place value okay so now does that answer our question
$10.87 i understand that but did that answer that why do you think the clerk did incorrectly that s right the clerk didn t like lining up the numbers by place value done so if i have going to add this over here okay so now what do you think the clerk did
k i think he put the one in the one s place and then he okay so he put the one s for our one.97 in the one s place over here and then 9 in the 10 s places
10s in the 100s so what about the ¢89 he put the i think he put the 0 on top of the 9 okay
where do you think the clerk may have put the 0 he put it in the okay so you think . you think he put the 0 over here yep and then and then the one in the 10 s place for the dollar and okay so we want to see that that the clerk may have put the one over here
no the 0 s the 0 so we re going to change that to 89 then okay so the one one.97 someone . someone else g what do you think about the one.97
what is the clerk thinking one.97 sit up
sit up please what do you think s i think that he put the one in 0 you think he could have put the one take off the one as in the 10 s place
and then . and then 97 yeah where would you think the clerk add the 9 in the 10 s place and the 7 and then add it done what would you have done
i want to hear what you as a student if you were the clerk what would you have done done someone that i haven t heard from what would you have done if you were the clerk huh
okay besides that something we ve done in class in the classroom before we add what does teacher w say you have you estimate so how would you estimate the sum of these 2 numbers r okay so say i would have round up the one.97 to $2 okay and
excuse me r and round the ¢89 to one so you know that my bill should not be what more than $23 should not be more than $3 okay so we had a situation like that
so you would have round up this number to $2 and this one to a dollar so you would know so if that clerk s your bill is $10.87 you would have said no it s not and probably show the clerk a few things right so that s this is a real life situation time this is very important you know the estimation
when you re adding and subtracting decimals to estimate 1st what the sum will be so that when you actually solve the problem you know whether your answer is correct or not okay so good so now what i want you to do right now i want you to turn to page 9 start with number one after you solve each problem you can work with the person sitting next to you
after you solve each problem starting with number one you can work with the person sitting next to you i want you to estimate 1st before you solve the problem think about listen carefully everyone think about the context think about what operation you will use to solve the problem estimate is everyone listening because right now i m not sure heard me
say you said so why do you have to think 1st before you actually solve the problem estimate think about the context estimate think about the operation you will use to solve the problem and then solve the problem so i m going to give you 5 minutes to solve the 1st problem one then we re going to meet together and one person will share their answer okay
5 minutes okay so i need you my friend to really work with her so move your chair over and the 2 of you are working together you can choose to join them or you can work with
up i need you to work with someone okay so let s go while you who do you want to work with group do you want to join this group choice all right so sit up
him you can not be sit by yourself all right okay make sure that you work and you re not having conversation about the wrestling match or whatever else okay so you have to work with this wait a minute
together work with this group and join this group join this conversation okay one number one remember number one reads so what s going on with number one
7575 do you agree no do for number one 75 do you agree 125 okay did you estimate though yes at 1st yes so he asked okay why i because i already know that if you took away 25 so you already knew by reading the problem it was going to be a subtraction problem
by reading the problem you thought it s going to be subtraction yeah okay all right so with subtraction what do we know about subtraction when we re subtracting 2 numbers like when you know left then you know it s subtraction all right okay so i m not sure but let s move on so you know i mean it s you know it s subtraction so what do we know about subtraction when we re subtracting 2 numbers
okay so that means that the number i started with is going to be more or less than my answer less huh less less okay so wait a minute did i phrase that correctly your answer is going to be more or less than what you started with less okay so that . so how did you solve it
what you re answer is going to be less than okay 150s okay so you have to say where you are all right so less that 15000s good okay so let s answer the question with a sentence please and you can write the number in your journal so what did you guys estimate the answer to be
it did you estimate it at 1st huh or maybe what teacher w said did you think about the operation you will use to solve the problem do i want you to think about the operation to solve the problem problem think about the operation and then estimate and then solve
okay so you estimated it to be what you estimate it to be okay i like that even use the symbol about okay yes all right so you re estimating that your answer is going to be 8500s okay so what do you think
do you agree with this estimation did she over estimate or under estimate did she over estimate here or under estimate think about the number that you have in front under under estimate why do you think that
say why do you think she under estimated say what you re thinking all answers are correct answers remember what i say
else why did she under estimate maybe she under estimated because so if she has this number here okay so how many hundredths is this how many hundredths is this number 5 this is 5 tenths so how many hundredths is that 5 hundredths 50 hundredths 50 hundredths okay
so this is 50 hundredths so if i have 50 hundredths here i have one and 50 hundredths and i m subtracting this number from it is this a good estimate so what do you think her estimate should have been it should be as close as possible to the right answer
okay all right but you re on the right track you can solve okay well i ll be back one okay you had something on your paper anything so what was your estimate 500 what was your remember you estimate 1st
i want you guys to get in the habit of estimating your answers before you actually solve them did you think about the operation okay did you think about the operation you will use to solve the problem okay yeah but i wanted you to think about all of these things i read the problem okay so what was so what was the answer how did you get this answer i don t see any work
did you solve it in your no i already knew it because 0 because yeah 5025 is half of 50 so you just have to do one ah i already know she says all right okay but you have to write all of these you have to show your work
one okay remember the directions we have to and i would like you although this isn t perfect everyone i would like although this isn t perfect i would like you to use this chart okay so if you do come up excuse me everyone listen up
if i call you you need able to you have to . you have to articulate clearly your answer and what you re thinking your estimation and all of that okay would you like to share up okay so let s who would like to read the problem me
me someone else read it quickly it starts to rain hundredths of a mile how much does she have left to okay let s show us what you did
chart okay as you read the problem what did you think subtraction and what was your estimate estimate huh
problem okay so as we work on the next problem everyone i want you to so remember you were using that place value chart numbers okay i know again it s not perfect this is the best i . okay so if you re writing you can write over here
line them up under the correct place okay everyone is looking okay
okay so let s look at s work so what who can can you explain to the class what you did i did . everyone stop listen i did one.5 -0 point i added the 0 supposed to do
okay all right good thank you okay so there is something that s missing when we re solving a word problem you a sentence a sentence to answer the question of how much does she have left to clean
okay yeah but what is the strategy called when you line up the numbers vertically what is the strategy called the traditional algorithm so she used the traditional algorithm to solve the problem
a okay so she used the traditional algorithm okay and now like the way as i was walking around shared that you know what teacher g i didn t even add the . i didn t even she had the correct answer and i m trying to figure out where did she get the number
what i know that if she has one and 5 tenths of a mile . of a mile . one and 5 tenths miles to clean and i know 5 tenths is equivalent to 50 hundredths okay so i know 25 hundredths is half of 50 hundredths so i didn t have to subtract
i knew that the answer was one and 25 hundredths plus remember when you have this thinking in your head you need to be able to articulate to write it on paper okay all right answer you have to explain your thinking so 5 more minutes to solve the next problem
d i know okay so that means we are reading the problem together because i see is working by himself
you need to come closer sweetie so you can share move over you can still you can t move but you can still be part of this conversation
seat get a seat please i m just adding this and then i m estimating 0 no so 400 okay so . so you went okay that sounds 400 i m not 400 or . 4000 no
all you need okay go ahead yeah so what do you think conversation she says 400 do you agree that should be rounded to 400s ah that should stay the same no it should but we re remember we re estimating 1st we have to round up to 4 something 4 what
agree 4 what do you think she s saying that we have to round the number to 4 something she s not sure if it s going to be 400 tenths okay if it s going to be 4 tenths 4 hundredths or 4 thousandths 0 i know what it s going to be agree what do you think
this number here you would round it to . this number . 4 thousandths 4 hundredths or 4 tenths think about the grid think about the grid grid excuse me
okay you cannot be on the videotaping so if you need something and you need a working pencil you should not be out of your seat what the understand you so what do you think speak okay so think about the grids
if i m representing this number how many hundredths is it how many hundredths is this number 77 how many hundredths 70 no we have a lot more work to do guys
that 0 that s 10 this 11 yeah how many hundredths 3737 hundredths right so this is 37 hundredths okay if i want to okay i m going to leave you to think about that okay i want you think about estimating you have the correct operation okay but what would your estimate be
one let me ask you this question would your answer be more or less than one more more than one okay think about it okay so what do you think what was your estimate 25 umm your estimate what did you estimate 400 huh 400 so you estimated these 2 numbers to be about 4 hundredths this is the you mean the whole number 400
no 104.0 let s think about that some more 0 okay so what was your estimate what was your estimate tell me about your estimate 1st
 . i rounded this up to . to . 3 okay so you rounded this up to 3 what
303 tenths 33300s okay this is 3 hundredths is that correct okay okay so what do you mean k okay what do you think
3 tenths 3 tenths okay so you round this to 3 tenths all right so what about this one to 4 hundredths thousandths ah
4 thousandths okay so can you write 4 thousandths for me on your paper so that s 4 thousandths okay that is correct that is 4 thousandths you think this number should be rounded to 4 thousandths what can you read this number for me
what 400 thousandths okay so your estimate you guys playing you re having a conversation here that s not mathematical 2 okay no but then again let s think about the problem estimate okay everyone who would like to share their answers so remember everyone
okay i think i m leaving you guys too much time to solve these and we may have to move 0 the time is going back too quickly all right who would like to share then we move into to number 2 and the rest of the problems we may have to who would like to share me
share wants to share okay it s not that i don t want you to share i wanted someone else because you always . you always raise your hand
okay so wait a minute
can we ask where this 75 hundredths is coming from excuse me i m stopping everyone focus sweetie let s can you step to this side please okay everyone i need you to pay attention to s work okay so turn look at the board
here okay so can you explain to the class what 75 hundredths is coming from okay so you re changing the number to can you tell us why you changed the number to 75 hundredths because i see 25 hundredths cleans 25 hundredths of a mile
d why don t you move back to your seat for now move so i need you to sit over here for awhile okay all right so where did you get 75 hundredths from from so you changed a number
why did you do that okay so why did you change the number from 375 thousandths to 75 hundredths we re looking at the board
n yes okay but you changed the number completely though okay i m ready go ahead i m glad you understand okay go ahead multiplication and okay we re listening right now
yes numbers so you think she decomposed the 375 okay everyone so seems to think that what did is that she decomposed a number that we have
should this number be 75 hundredths or 75 thousandths 75 thousandths should this what do you think should this number be 75 hundredths or 75 thousandths 75 thousandths okay so this number should be but where is this number coming from here
okay so her answer was 4.00 that s why it s important that you estimate before you actually solve the problem okay because if you estimated by getting 4 if this number is less than one everyone listen carefully
if this number is less than one and this number is also less than one this number again is less that 50 hundredths and this number is less than 50 hundredths so i know that my answer is not going to be greater than one correct correctly i know the board
problem i want you to look at the decimals and i want you to estimate in your journal i want you to write each problem and i want you to estimate what you think the sum or difference is okay
for each problem number 2 a b c d e and f i want you to write this problem in your journal and i want you to estimate what you think the sum or difference is okay so then you can continue
k because i need my mom you need your mom mom to know that huh to know that i found my glasses okay so you need to tell your mom that you found your glasses and why are you upset about that me why are you upset about that because i m thinking something is terribly wrong
me but you know when you get home you can tell your mother do you understand okay you don t need p teacher p okay so you just need to tell your mother that you found your glasses okay did you go to the office here because i need okay to call mom
mom can you call your mother you don t huh i don t know her number okay all right come here okay why don t you go let me give you a pass to go to the office and . come in
sit maybe get a seat . let me give you a pass you have a pencil what did you write with okay may i use your pencil number yeah that s not a reason to cry
happy she s going to give you the biggest hug because you found your glasses go ahead go to the office and call mom all right you come here can i have my pencil yes you may have your pencil okay you i d like stop right where you are are you re estimating you re looking at these 2 numbers and you re just estimating come on
how am i supposed to estimate that wait a minute i don t understand you . so if you look at this number what do you think the sum will be the sum the sum of these 2 numbers
right correct do you agree sum okay so what do you think the sum will be you what do you think what do you estimate the sum to be
not the time sir focused are we finished everyone we should have finished by now i m finished you re finished good what do you think look at this the other one
let me see your estimation okay all right did you guys add or estimate dang teacher b i got them wrong wait a minute she told me minus you 2 can totally see that this mistake ah
yeah i m glad you totally see this mistake okay what do you think what s your mistake what did you do wrong i thought that was yes number 2 f i thought that was a plus sign you thought that was an addition not a subtraction here they re completely 2 different symbols come on
we need to be focused so what s your estimate what are you all estimating everyone are these like supposed to round i don t know what have we been doing in the classroom there is a seat over there sit down please i don t know what have you been doing in the classroom okay i don t get it
here they re understanding okay you re estimating yeah so what s the 1st answer what do you think the sum is about you re estimating the sum right what you well you estimate the sum what s going to be told you it s 131
on what are you talking about good job 131 i totally agree with you but why i got 131 because if you add not like add it by paper but i in my head i added 103 +27 and i thought i was going to get 130
okay 9 . 9 +2 is 11 so okay so you i added the one and the . 0 i was thinking about something else when you say you added the whole numbers i thought that you thought 0 this number is close to one so all i have to do is add one more 0 okay because remember you rounding the numbers and then you re adding
2 okay so what have you done mister estimate okay did you add yes okay i see 28103 good i like that okay so this you round to 5 tenths and this is one okay
now okay so let s see what we have here with and desk okay so where is number one okay so let me see number one j i thought you said we were estimating that s right you no
one we ve done these already you . all right you re estimating the answers to number 2 a through f okay so 0 you re adding you re not estimating that s good you re not following direction i know i m just okay wait wait wait a minute if i have to . if i had to grade you that would be a 0 because you re not following direction estimating it no no no no
you don t do that estimating 1st and then you add okay so we need to follow directions it s important we follow directions and you re not following directions as well
okay for number one everyone . what did i do with my books so remember if we want number 2 a through f so number a what is your estimate and how did you get . who would like to share their estimate for a
me okay we re listening everyone that means you stop what you re doing and then no estimate you didn t estimate you 1st who would like what did you do
i added in my head so we had . we had . 27 and 9 tenths +103 and 2 tenths i need everyone to pay attention we re going to share a couple of these problems and then we re going to stop and move on to reading w i added up the whole wait a minute
i don t want have everybody s attention because right now i don t have s attention pencil because when i m talking you re paying attention you need to stop what you re doing me i don t have your attention
w i added the whole numbers 1st and then added the . so s saying i mentally i did the whole numbers meaning 27 +103
be 1111 so i m going to write the number 11 is this correct yes 13 what is it
numbers 9 tenths and 2 tenths think about tenths 11 tenths 11 tenths yep okay what is the sum of 9 tenths and 2 tenths let s think about the grid everyone if we shared if we have 2 grids and we shared 9 tenths think about is that 11 a whole number
one what one okay one so if we shared the grid that would be 9 tenths and another 10th that would be 9 tenths that would be 110th 2 tenths so that equals to one and 110th not the number 11 okay so let s go back
job so that equals to so you added 9 tenths +2 tenths that equals one and 110th and what was the sum of these 2 numbers 100 and . 130100 . what 130 okay so is that okay so you estimated the sum to be what i estimated the sum to be 131
131 so did everyone use that strategy or did someone did you use anyone use another strategy besides that what strategy did you use one i 27 everyone is paying attention you re not paying attention here
ahead okay so say i round this number the 27 and 9 tenths to 28 because the 9 tenths is close to one so this 27 should change to 28
103103 okay listen to the reason
he s saying that 2 tenths is close to well 0 he said so i m going to leave that as 103 okay so we know that when we round this number is less than 5 right so we leave the we leave the number so that s 103 then we added the 2 numbers
that equals to 131 okay so everyone see that so that s what you did already okay good so who has completed f me okay so let s see f up okay so this one is a subtraction so i m going to have someone else
j so how did you solve how did you estimate the difference of these 2 numbers estimate okay so what did you estimate the answer to be
go ahead decrease okay what number will decrease what number will decrease the bigger number okay which the 982 thousandths okay so you re not paying attention here am no the board is you re looking at the board if you re paying attention yes
he said you know this is 2 tenths so i m still going to subtract the 2 tenths from the 9 tenths so what is your answer
we ve been working on decimals ordering decimals decimal so i will need to find out from this class what are you still confused about i want some idea from this class what are you still confused about
no listen to my question what are you raise your hand and tell me what are you still confused about when working with decimals what are you still confused about
no i was talking about okay one person is thinking about my question and one person is answering my question turn your body around and face that wall
about okay so we haven t done that
fraction but we ve done a little bit of that that s 6 tenths 6 tenths can be written as 6 tenths correct so the fraction okay so if i have 25 hundredths that can be written as 14th correct
all right open up your journals to the next clean page we ve been talking about division so we re going to go back to division today
before we move on to what i want to talk about let s talk about the parts of the division problem please okay who can raise their hand and tell me which number is the dividend which number is the dividend
8989 good the dividend is the one being divided up divisor 77 is our divisor up okay so then if i divide i write our little reminder does mcdonald s sell burgers and i start with division divide 7 goes into 81
time then i multiply 177 then i . subtract subtract 8 -71 now how many times does 7 go into 19 again if you need to draw the little house again do it okay
1922 because 7 times 2 is 14 do we have to write all that down yes write this down please okay 7 times 214 okay 19 -145 anything to bring down
12 quotients the quotients okay what i want to talk about today is the remainder mean okay so if i asked you to tell me what a remainder is what would you tell me
what is a remainder it s if you can t put the 7 into the 5 so then the 5 becomes the remainder because you can t use that okay say it s the leftovers it s the leftovers
remainder it s the number that s been subtracted the 2nd time but it s smaller than the devisor good it s smaller than the divisor which tells you that i can t make another group
leftover it doesn t quite make a group so it s just kind of hanging out okay leftover 55 okay when you see a division question they can ask you lots of different things about that remainder
okay what if i said looking at this problem i have 89 plates and i m packing up my plates because i m moving box how many boxes will be full full 1212 how do you know
because they have the number and the leftover is 5 so is 12 leftover so that question the answer s not 12 remainder 5 is it
12 okay what if i told you i have 89 students and we re going on a field trip and we re going on this field trip in vans instead of buses
each van sits 7 kids kids in the classroom 12120 bye bye 5 people that we just left behind
full 1212 how many people will be in that 13th van 55 okay don t leave those people behind it they paid so they need to come so we have to get a 13th van who s going to drive 0 that doesn t count the driver
drivers okay what if i asked you i have again 89 kids in my class i m having those kids stand in lines of 7 how many lines will i have and how many people will be left over
there will be 5 people left over there will be 5 people left over have 1212 i ll have 12 lines with 5 people left over do i don t know teacher can t you put one in the 0 no you can t nope i want 7 in each line
if i could put one more in each line i would have 13 right yeah okay good so that s what we re going to work on today when you come to the group with me you re independent practice today is just going to be practicing the division process centers they re going to be shorter centers today since we got a little bit of a late start
when you come to me this is very important please bring a pencil okay i ll have the sheet for you but i need for you to bring a pencil with you yes ma am are we still going to do like the division and checking yes that s what you re practice in independent practice
sir okay let me write this down and i ll get it for you all right your independent practice today is in your hard math book go ahead and take out your hard math books all of them you only have one hard math book
210 okay this is the same thing we ve been doing you re going to divide and then you re going to check answer yes ma am okay the question times the devisor times the devisors 7 times 2
7 times one +one okay and then you have to add your remainder add your remainder remainder 4 +5988 if this matches that yes then you are right okay so you re going to start with number 17 and do as many as you can up through 28
okay again since they re short centers you probably won t have time to finish all of that minutes so as long as i see that you are quiet and you are working you will be fine if you are at games we are playing 0 no 99 today if you don t remember how much the face cards are worth it s right here on this sticky note
here someone in group b can write it on the board all right so group a with your pencils meet me at the table group c you re at independent practice b the cards are right here can i use my math journal yes you may use your math journal if you need to i think she s going to put it on the board for us
all right come on have a seat right there all right missing one person can we of course teacher what group am i in
now 0 really yep independent practice
around quickly take one and pass it around all right group b let s get it written and get started
groups of 3 or 4 please okay everyone should have 2 sheets
words you mean this one okay does everyone have 2 sheets
2 okay one is the problem sheet and one is the answer sheet
all right so we re going to start with problem a is do i have a volunteer who would like to read problem a to us me
a the teacher the teacher has 55 how many good so what s the 1st thing you always do when you get a word problem
problem you underline what s important you underline what s important question i only have one person who knows one thing that s important s the teacher has all right the teacher has 55 glasses
it okay what else is important each box holds 8 glasses each box holds 8 glasses good and what do we want to know j how many boxes will be full we want to know how many boxes will be full
and this is where it s very important that you pay attention to that question we want to know how many boxes will be full okay so pull out your answer sheet and you have some space here to work out your problem how can we figure out how many boxes will be full
why because each box holds 8 glasses good right so what will my division problem look like dividend i want to put the problem together and then i ll have you start
no 55 all right says 55 do we agree yes one person agrees yes all right what s my divisor 88 okay because we have 55 glasses and we re putting them into groups of . 88 all right so write that problem down in box a or it s not a box really it s an oval
oval not in the middle in the oval where it says a you re good
55 what s 8 times 540 is that close to 55 or can you get closer
no 8 times 6 okay what s 8 times 64848 is that close to 55 or can you get closer closer okay so try 8 times 7 what s 8 times 756 does that work
times that s a little crooked but . then i just . okay it goes on top of the last number you used yes 0 did that number okay well what should you have written here you can t really see it see okay so what s your next step then
i have to multiply okay so your next step is multiply 484848 okay so what s your next step
no we ve divided we ve multiplied what comes next 48 we have to . you have to regroup so what do you have to do
regroup measuring hold that thought okay so we ve subtracted what do you get when you subtract
when you subtract . what did you get 55 -48 is 0 on can you do 5 -8 so what do you have to do okay
v okay and this 5 becomes . 44 okay 15 -8 okay so most of you have told me that you can t do 5 -8 so this becomes 15 i need eyes up here and this becomes ..
4415 -8 that becomes 0 that becomes 774 -400 so do i need to put a 0 remainder remainder okay so now i ve done the math
e how many boxes will be full how many boxes will be full so look at your answer and decide how many boxes will be full don t shout it out but i m going to ask each one of you
okay but the question is how many will be full e will be full how many will be full how many will be full 6 how many will be full i got it
i got my answer all right somebody tell me what a remainder 7 box looks like i know i know i asked you how many boxes will full 6
you it tells you how many full groups you have and the remainder tells you how many are left over full how many will be full 6 how many will be full
6 how many will be full how many will be full okay which number tells you whole groups 6 okay you will have 6 full boxes
leftover this tells you how many full groups me me again
matthew s going on a field trip there are 55 students going on the field trip they will use vans to transport the students each van holds 8 students how many vans will they need all right
important there are 55 students okay 55 students let s underline it students all right what else is important g each van holds 8 students each van holds 8 students
know what do i want to know know how many vans will hold 55 students good i need to know how many vans i need to hold all of the students
do 6 eight . 8 divided by 5558 divided by 55 no they 8 goes there and so like that yeah but we ve already done that right know so what s the answer to the problem we know the answer to the problem is 6 remainder 7
no we want to know how many vans will they need i know i know i know you ve already done it i know okay here s the answer you get when you work it out order i know i know group b your volume s a little bit too loud order what do you think 7 what do you think
8 what do you think 7 what do you think 6 what do you think 77 you think 7 what do you think 7 all right someone who said 7 explain to me why
why do i need 7 you ve got a remainder of 7 and then okay so i have 6 full vans of students and then and then the one van will only have 7 but then one van holds and then one will have one less and will have 7 good okay so i ll have 6 full vans but i ll have to order that 7th van to take those kids
need 77 so the answer to that is . vans all right and next time we meet we will do c and d together what are these these are just your answer choices for division unit all right so i want you to take these i want you to fold them in half and put them in your math journals
our . math journal no put it in your math journal okay once you ve folded it you may go to independent practice
games group a is moving to independent practice
all right i m starting the countdown 54321
center what are we doing all right take one and pass it around
do we have to use pencils yes sir i said that
paper do we have to copy nope what s all this noise i hear
time yes you should have 2 a question sheet and an answer sheet
open the book and get to work right now
all right so what we re talking about today is how to answer questions interpreting the remainder okay so figuring out what to do with that remainder and today we re going to do questions a and b and then next time that we meet we ll finish up and do c and d
m the teacher is packing boxes with glasses each box holds 8 glasses the teacher has 55 glasses how many boxes will all right so when we get a word problem what s the 1st thing we do before we try to figure it out h good we underline the important things
m each box holds 8 okay each box holds 8 glasses you can underline it or circle it whatever you need to do to be able to see it here okay what else is important
information what is the question asking us how many boxes will be full how many boxes will be full okay so we know we have 55 glasses we can put 8 glasses in a box and we want to know how many boxes will be full
out what do you think by dividing okay says divide m well because she has 8 glasses and she has 8 glasses no boxes 8 boxes no she doesn t have 8 boxes each box ..
holds 8 glasses okay holds 8 glasses and the teacher has to divide glasses so she s taking those glasses and she s putting them into . groups groups any time you take a big number and put them into groups you are . dividing dividing so what will my division problem look like
dividend says 55 do we agree yes all right because that s how many glasses we have divisor 88 okay
dividing does mcdonald s sell hamburgers all right so in oval a go ahead and write your problem and see if you can find the answer to the division problem come on
thank you for working quietly thank you for working quietly 8 divided i mean i kind of figure it s 54 right is it
no 48 right okay so you told me 8 times 6 is 48 no what happens if i go up to 8 times 7 it will be too well it s 64
6456 that s too high right times 6 times remember it goes after the last 5 because that s the last number you used it what s 8 times 6 sweetheart don t get frustrated just think about it for a minute
okay so you did 8 times 6 and you got ..
48485 -8 can t can t do it 54415 -874 -400
so it s remainder 7 all right so the answer to the division problem is 6 remainder 7 you how many boxes she needs no that s not what they asked again 0 how many boxes will be full how many boxes will be full
so you have to look at this 6 remainder 7 and you have to figure out which part tells you how many boxes are full so what do you think full okay what do you think
full do you want me to come back to you think okay so how many will be full k what do you think
k 6 all right those of you who said 6 why do you say 6 me okay so these are your leftovers
what how many boxes are full how many full groups you have have yes 66 boxes will be full so you can just write 6 boxes
6 boxes you can t just write 6 because 6 what right i m going to think you mean 6 elephants
us matthew s going on a field trip there are 55 students going on the field trip they will use vans to transport the students each van holds 8 students how many vans will they need all right j there are 55 students 55 students
circle that what else is important each van holds 8 students okay each van holds 8 students and what do i want to know this time
need and because remember we want to take all the students right yes out how do i figure it out divide i divide what do i divide 55 divided by 855 divided by 8 but wait we ve already done that haven t we yeah okay we know that 55 divided by 8 gives us 6 remainder 7
problem it asked you how many vans will they need to take all the students think 7 what do you think 7 what do you think 77 what do you think how many vans do they need 6 what do you think all right why did you say 6
thinking don t be embarrassed why d you say 6 me did you just guess why d you pick 6 because it s the same okay but they used all right last time it was asking how many would be full right
full but when we go on a field trip do we fill up the buses and say 0 sorry you don t fit stay at school no do we get another one we get another one because we have to take everybody need . 71 more for those 7 people
sense okay is that how the rest of you got your answer yes all right today are we finished yep this i want you to take this fold it in half and tuck it into your math journals so that you have it next time we come to group
all right ladies and gentlemen let s rotate to your last center
all right take one and pass it around take one and pass the rest around you will get 2 sheets of paper one will be a problem sheet one will be an answer sheet
okay you should have a question sheet and an answer sheet does everyone have an answer sheet nope i don t have one
board no you need to play the game the normal way otherwise you will lose the privilege of playing the game you should have an answer sheet and a question sheet i need a question sheet all right everyone has a question and an answer no
what do you need all right so today in group since we only have 10 minutes and each group only had 10 minutes so it s not just you we re going to do a and b and then next time we meet in group we will do c and d today today we re talking about how to interpret your remainder
so how to look at that problem you have and then figure out what the remainder means okay so read question a to us
the teacher is packing boxes with some glasses each box holds 8 glasses the teacher has 55 glasses how many boxes will she fill okay so what do we do when we get a word problem we have to see what parts of the word problem is important all right
here each box holds 8 glasses all right each box holds 8 glasses it why can t we use a highlighter because i didn t want you bringing all that with you d the teacher has 55 glasses all right the teacher has 55 glasses
what glasses like glasses glasses glasses it doesn t say sunglasses okay all right what do i want to know here what to do
me how many boxes will you . will . will . be . be full full yep actually i want to know how many boxes will be full
out yep you can write it on the answer sheet you can divide it
divisor 8 all right go ahead and work out that problem top this should not take you very long
are you working huh are you working it okay go ahead and check it
4 what s 8 times 756 are you sure about that yes so 54
it how many times does 8 go into 556 times 6 times what s 8 times 6484855 -48
7 you have to regroup you have to regroup okay so 6 hold on the answer to the problem is 6 remainder 7 it does the question ask you for the answer to the division problem you how many boxes what is the remainder what is left how many will be . 66 and 7 were left good do you agree
yes all right do you agree do you agree or are you too busy looking at someone else full 6 okay what if it asked you how many will be left over 77 good so you have 6 boxes so the answer to a
do so you just write 6 boxes but it doesn t ask you that it asks how many boxes are . full 6 boxes all right b it says the glass is going on a field trip
trip they will use vans to transport the students students how many vans will they need how do i solve this 6 division what do i divide 8 divided by 55 55 isn t that the same
are 55 divided by 8 i found the answer 6 remainder 7 all right we ve already done that
you how many vans will be be full 7 how many need how many vans do i need 8 i mean 7 they ll need 77 what do you think how many vans do i need to order 6 wait 7
how many vans do i need to order 600 we re going to leave everyone here no i mean . that s a 60 yeah 66 are you going to volunteer to be one of the 7 that stay back how many vans do i need 77 well then i only need 6 but i m saying i have 55 people who have paid 6 vans will be full but i need to order a ..
extra 7th van an extra van to take those last few people all right does that make sense how you can get the same answer but the answer to the question be different yes good no it was 10 you got here at 9 55 it is now 10 5
all right so i want you to take your 2 sheets fold them in half and put them in your math journal so you have them next time we come to group all right i need you to begin cleaning up and go back to your seats
is that the same thing okay it thank you today we are going to be doing a lot of things lot of different activities you are not going to finish everything in one day okay
so students will be able to develop strategies for multiplying that will involve breaking apart numbers okay so when you are with me we are going to be talking about multiplication strategies and how to break them apart large numbers okay we are going to make them into smaller friendly numbers so we can multiply them okay
now when i am working with a group at the rug no inappropriate when i am working with a group at the rug you are going to be doing some independent activities and some partner activities
okay independent activities subtraction problems i gave you you are going to be doing that independently okay time if anybody is left out you can go next time okay we are going to start here and work clockwise around the room for fast math
then i will have you go with 3 over there and so forth i will let you know remember when you do the fast math you are doing one game after the game you are done so it should take you 5 to 7 minutes now partner activities you can only do a partner activity once you are done with the subtraction problems
once you are done with the subtraction problems you can do the partner activities the planning a party do not worry about that until after you are up here on the rug that is one of the papers i gave you okay which one do you have i can give you mister today it says planning a party on it
help when you come up i will give it to you okay the other partner activities are the games that i showed you yesterday games you will need a notebook and somebody in your group will have to teach you how to play it okay the game is target 20 or target 200
if you want to do a round of target 20 then step it up a little bit do target 200 that is good game just play with a partner i do not want 2 versus 2 unless you had 4 in your group
fine if there is an odd number of people in your group like 5 people in your group then do 3 together then 2 people together okay both of these games you are going to need math notebooks and either the digit cards or the dice okay
yes this group right here you 4 right here you are going to start with the fast math and you 2 will go after them right so this group right here you are going to be starting your subtraction problems mister j is bagels a pencil and a notebook if you do not have it it is right there
know give me some room so i can work on them too
open up to a new book new page you have your notebook you know what guys work it out
book if you are doing the subtraction problems and you need more work i have plenty of math paper right here or if you want to use line paper to practice your place value
i need you where you are supposed to be
here what i want you to do is we are going to look at problem one and we are going to think about what the objective is today about breaking apart larger numbers into smaller friendly numbers mister j needs to buy 14 dozen bagels for a big party
buy you can talk with each other in your group you can yell out answers i want you to solve your work show your work think about what we have done with multiplication so far pictures think about using thinking blocks think about doing those strategies to help you solve this
12 write your answer in a complete sentence please you decide this is multiplication right this is multiplication yes can you do addition too
it you wrote an equation
sentence just wait very good
i did not do it right you did not but that is all right
it i did it so hardly you did what did it so hardly we will put that on it to show it
is that 168 i do not know out let us see it
okay that is just a strategy to set it up nice you guys got it
okay now i do not care if your answer is right or wrong right now it you need to settle down you doing your work
yes stop at number one up i want you to share what you did my put your answer on the elmo so we can see
let us have come up we are going to stop at number one right now and we are going to talk about some different strategies that we can do okay we can deal with that okay
here i added whoa what number are you adding 12 so how many 12s are you adding okay so i got 28
i added the 8 and 2 20 okay so i got 16 16 i got 16 for that and the total is 168
so if your total is 168 why do you have 158 right there fine how many people did we will figure it out how many people did the repeated addition so one 2 3 4 out of 5 of you 4 of you did that and that is fine
what it takes a long time right so this is a strategy that you guys feel comfortable with which is good you we did multiplication problems and we did problems like this or in this case an addition problem it is going to take us a long time okay you can sit right there the chance of getting it wrong increases greatly
i am going to show you some strategies that we are going to do to be able to multiply these larger numbers by breaking them up okay
did used the standard algorithm for multiplying how many people have never seen that before my mom taught me that your parents might have taught you that
once we feel really comfortable perhaps a little later in the year i will teach you this one but right now what we are going to do is i am going to teach you how to break apart the arrays
job i feel proud of myself let us think about this as an array okay now you knew that you had to do 14 times 12
okay thought at 1st it was 4 times 12 but then you talked 12 that does not look like a very good that is not good
again actually i think i will try a square square close enough
okay i want you to think of this as an array and think about breaking apart this array into smaller arrays to make it friendly
this instead of trying to break apart both numbers why do not we try to break apart one number 10 you want to break apart into a 10 what i can do let me just move the 14 out of the way
14 you said you want to break it up into a 10 and what 10 10 you can not do that why can not you do that exactly we broke it up into a 10 and a 4 let me do that right now
focus we broke up the 14 into a 10 and a 4 job so now what we can do is we can multiply the 10 times the 12 and the 4 times the 12 what is 10 times 12 120 what is 4 times 12
168 good look at what we did there 14 how did we break it up according to what place value we used place value good we had the 10 in the 10s place a 4 in the ones place split it apart like that good did you see that
nice good let us think about okay you want to do it with the 12 we can do it with the 12 he is going to split it into a 6
draw a line you just can not make it one 6 6 no here now split it in half 3 no you broke up the array and now you have to draw a line to show 6 and 6
go ahead good now let us see what he did here 6 times 6 no what are you going to multiply 6 times 20 good so once you do 6 times 14 you get your answer here you are going to have the same answer here
so what is 14 times 6 gentlemen you are doing a subtraction problem right now you 2 put your name on the board because you are fooling around 60 and what is 4 times 6
24 so 60 and 24 is 84 then we add those up and we get 168 so there is a lot of ways we can break up the arrays personally i like what did value so do we feel good about that
yeah let us take a look at number 2
okay if that is what you think to do go ahead and write your answer down paper we will do it when he comes back
4 you can go on the computer you will go next okay that does not show you 10 dozen he bought 10 dozen so you put one dozen then 10
10 dozen think about what they are asking now i have not seen anybody here i am a little bit disappointed to be honest with you i have not seen anybody for number one and 2 even think about doing actually tried it for the 1st one you did not even think about using the thinking blocks did you
if you went to number one that is what you need to do out so for number one if i was using the thinking blocks we had to find the whole and you had to multiply the 14 and the 12
think about what we are doing in class what we have done in class simple you did 12 times 10 and what did you get 12 times 10 is 120 do i want you to turn your paper over on the back or you can use your notebook paper either one
over i mean open up your notebooks you guys need to settle down a little bit i am a little disappointed that you are being so goofy settle down let us do 16 times 12
let us do 14 times 18 you should be working right now
okay stop yelling out answers way i want you to think about these as arrays i did 16 times 12 and got 282
out why do not you sit on your bottoms
one more time warnings let us think about it you said you know what the last problem we did you said i feel pretty good about breaking it up according to place value let us take a look at this 16 times 12 12 times 16 whatever okay
you can put it left or on the top important so 12 times 16 attention you are going back to doing your repeated addition again doing let us focus on breaking it up
okay how can i break up the 12 2 what do you mean 12 by 6s okay
2 yeah okay yeah we can do that sure i just did not understand what you were saying there he said i can break it up into a 6 4 and a 2 because 6 +4 +2 equals 12
it what are some other ways that i can do this problem up 6 +5 +one
ways take away the 6 in 16 and make it 10 one you can break it up into as many pieces as you want right but i really like really friendly numbers that have a what in the ones place
0 so i personally you can do it any way you want i like to break it up according to place value doing a 10 and a 2 because it is really easy to multiply by 10s okay
i would have an easier time doing 10 times 16 than i would doing 6 times 16 it break up your array any way you want and the same goes for this one you can break it up any way you want okay then we will have you come up and you can show how you do it
me what are you supposed to do when you break it up we can break it up 16 times 12 160 and what am i going to multiply now 2 go back to your seat and do your work
16 2 times 16 is 32 good so what am i going to do when i have those numbers inside the array again add them add them up and what do i get for an answer
192 very good look at this one right here
did you are trying the traditional algorithm i did it wrong you made a mistake with your addition 3 you brought over the 0
one for some reason you carried a 10 there or a 100 over there error who can come up and break up the 14 i have a question yeah can you tell me what i did wrong because i do not really get it
okay what are you doing here buddy i added and broke it up into 6 5 and one and i broke 16 up into 8 and 8 no you are doing okay right this is what did you really need to make the array here
when we are multiplying we are multiplying the 12 times the 16 what you did is you took the 6 the 5 and the one
okay what you are supposed to do if you look at the array what is it 12 times 16 we were doing 12 so you said a 6 a 5 and a one
fine okay you 6 5 and one then we were doing 12 times 16
so then you broke up the 6 and you broke it up into an 8 and an 8 what i told you to do is break up one number number so we have to multiply these numbers times the 16 what you did is you did 6 5 and one and got 30 and then you did 8 times 8
16 that is 64 but that is besides the and then you added these together to get your answer no we are not multiplying we are not breaking up the 12 and multiplying the numbers into itself
we are taking the 12 and we are multiplying it by the 16 but in order to make it easier because those are big numbers i can not do 12 times 16 in my head what we decided to do is we decided to take one of the numbers break it apart and now we have to take the numbers that are broken apart and multiply by the 16
array you are not using the same strategy i am using what you are going to do for me right now is you are going to break up we are going to do 14 times 18 focus 14 break up the 14
fine do 6 5 why are you picking 6s and 5s are you really good at multiplying by 6s why not pick really friendly numbers that i am not saying you can not but my thing is i like to make my life easier
difficult i am not going to do 6 times 18 okay i can do it but can you do it super easy not let us do numbers that are really easy 10 friendly number 10 plus what equals 14
4 so here is 4 okay 10 +4 is 14 14 so what am i going to multiply now number we do not multiply the 10 and the 4 together that is 14
that when we multiply we are doing 14 times 18 right this what is 6 times 5 30 you know that 6 times 5 is 30
you know that problem but you are not taking the 6 and going i am going to do 2 times 2 times 2 which is 8 and then multiply it by the 5 are you multiply 2 times 2 times 2 is 8
problem he is breaking up the number and then he is multiplying it to itself number he is confused here you took this number the 14 and you were multiplying it to itself
no we multiply it to the other number just like we do with single digit multiplication okay that let us see if you get it
head because i know i do not what we did is we took the 14 and we broke it up into a 10 and a 4 right so tell me what numbers now 14 tell me what numbers are you going to do
you are going to do 14 times 18 but 4 is easier so 4 times 18 and 10 times it 18 good this is our next step is going from the array to this
yes dear you did the subtraction you can play target 20 by yourself but nobody else is there so she can do that by herself so 10 times 18
number any time you have zeros in the ones place and we multiply it is going to be very easy here this is why the array is a good visual okay now there is still a section of the array that is missing
no 18 times 4 that now we have to do the 4 times the 18
watch it is not that hard but look at that
8 4 times 8 is 32 right what you can do is you can just do your 2 by one strategy multiply it and get your answer okay
do you see we multiplied the number on the left by the number up top just like we did with single digit problems right 6 times 6 is what
36 so we take a number on the left and we multiply it up top okay once you are done solving it and i check it and it is right you can do the rest of mister
j is problems and then do the story problems on the back okay then i will let you do the we will see how far along we are computers i do not know where you are going you are still with me
together sit and do your work down do you need to use the restroom why is your hand up what do you need do you need to do your subtraction
problems since you have not gone here yet you can do the target 20 target 200 or target 300 if nobody in your group is ready you can play by yourself them here is your ticket out of here let us keep it simple yes i want you to make an array
now you are not ready yet we are going to take it to the next level but we are doing arrays 1st concrete keep it simple
it you can break up anything you can break up any one of those numbers do i always like this is me good now what are you going to multiply 14 ata boy
good now put it there yes good you have it
14 you can do 3 numbers if you wanted to break up another number nice job go nice job
what about you big boy 3 times 14 watch let us try not to do it in your head if you do not have to 10 that would be 30 good so what is 3 times 4
12 what is 30 +12
42 add up those and you get your answer 82 boy yeah right practice with that
k i want to see what you are doing 1st of all i do not know why you are writing like mini me here give yourself some space
better draw the line here just so you get a visual
you are doing 10 times 14 do 3 times 14
can i do addition what is 3 times 10 34 no it is not 34
right i do not understand why you are getting out of your seat right now me why are you out of your seat why are you out of your seat
cards can i use the bathroom go ahead do i add those 2 numbers yes put the 42 there now add them yes
i will be right there if you can not do this one go on to the next one
now i asked you to come up here and you are still having a conversation with him see i want to see what work you have accomplished in the time you were by yourself computer i did not
that close it that is what he already said
144 none of us knew that automatically correct this is a tougher problem because we have a 2 digit by a 2 digit number that can be kind of tough when we were doing our 1st unit the factors multiples and arrays we said we can count the array up
we can count the columns we can count the arrays and add them together right that it can take a long time to add up all the rows and we can make a mistake when we are adding so that is a problem what i am going to teach you today is we are going to take this array and break it up into smaller pieces
that way we can multiply it a little bit easier okay i am going to put an array on the board because it is kind of tough to see with the glare there 12 why do not you make an array
we are going to do 12 times 12 now you should have already brought your notebook i know
answer i am worried about let us take this problem okay let us figure out a strategy so we can break this up enough with the pencil sharpening okay so let us do this
do if i said break up that array what are you going to do did you hear what he just said
he said what i will do is i will do 2 and 2 is 4 and then one and one is one and that is 14
no at the very least what you should have done if that is what you were thinking it would have made more sense if you said 2 times 2 is 4 and 10 times 10 because that is not a that is a 10
if you said 104 i could see how you would have gotten that but even that is not the answer we just take these 2 numbers and multiply them against each other
let us take one of the 12s and break apart one of those 12s any way we want as long as when we break it apart into smaller numbers it equals 12
anybody have any suggestions on how we want to do that what do you think
that what am i going to multiply now 6 times 6 6 i am not going to multiply somebody in the other group did this too
12 i am not going to multiply it against itself 2 no with before we broke let us look at what said
before we broke up the 12 and the 6s we were going to multiply 12 times 12 we were going to multiply this number by this number right so what would make sense now
10 6 and where are you getting the 10 yes i am going to multiply this 6 with this 12 does anybody know 6 times 12
i am going to erase this 12 right here because we made it into 6s it is it 62
no stop there work what is another way we can break this up
you guys broke it up into 6s we could break it up into 2s hard why is that hard i can break up the 12s if that is what feels good to you 2s how many 2s will i need 3 really how many 2s will i need to make 12
22s make 12
to so what am i going to multiply now now we are breaking them up into smaller parts we took one of the numbers and we broke it up into smaller parts
what am i going to multiply very good
12 2 times 12 is the same thing as 12 +12
12 so 24
24 so if it is going to be 24 here what is it going to be for the rest of them okay just put in those numbers do not even bother adding them up
say nice job
tiles okay everybody has got 10 tiles on their desk now right yes okay what shape are your tiles squares today we are going to start talking about area and we are going to start to talk about parameter
rectangles if i ask you to clean up this area what does that refer to area parameter of the classroom if i say clean up this area do i mean you are going to walk around the edges no the whole thing the whole thing when we talk about an area we talk about the whole thing
point what if i said guys put everything at your desk on the parameter of the classroom t around around the edge of the classroom right there is a difference between area and parameter okay i want you to take the tiles and make me a square using 4 of your tiles
hand just make me a square using 4 tiles okay honey i need you to make me a square using 4 tiles
lay them down honey make me a square what do we know about a square okay says it has 4 right angles but that is true about other shapes too right that is true about another shape
what is different about a square that is not true about an it has 4 equal sides all the sides are equal okay now how many tiles did it take to make your square
4 so if it took 4 tiles to make your square what is the area of your square okay now i want you to look at it and tell me what the parameter of your square is
on how did you get that i counted all the sides
why because there is no sides in the middle right but how did you count it 4 but you have got to count every tile right 0 try again are you counting just the outsides
on the parameter do we count the insides no okay what do we count the outside so what is the outside 8 does it make sense okay so we see now that area and parameter are 2 different numbers
guys this is the way that i have explained it do you guys remember when you 1st talked about area and parameter in school okay so this is what i explained just easy peasy without a formula area all a and a okay
parameter i call this prance around edge we are not going in the middle there parameter and prance p and p
do now can we come up with an easier way to do this
it if we were to come up with a formula for area and you told me that you have 4 blocks and they are all equal never mind
right and you told me that the area is 4 and you told me the parameter is 8 okay how long is each side 2 2 units
2 yes is this side 2 yes is this side 2 yes you told me the area is 4 that how can we come up with a formula for the area of a square tools do not play with the extra ones they are tools that let us do it another way
it make a square using 9 of your tiles
okay i will draw one with you it where is your square using 9 of your tiles 0 ding dong avon is calling me got it
a square using 9 you have got to use 9
you have a square have you used 9 count them fingers he has got that down when you made your square using 9 how many are in each row
3 like that this how many are on each side me how many
3 if there is 3 on this side and it is a square there is 3 on this side 3 on this side and 3 on this side right yes count your blocks and tell me what the area of that is 9 we are counting the whole thing right
all what is the parameter what is it 12 all right
right can we assume can we probe by using both of these that area and parameter are going to be different for a square okay so if we know excuse me that each side on a square has to have an equal number then can we come up with a formula for area
look at the area with a very badly written a for this one
numbers who can come up with a formula that would go for any square
formula area equals is it going to be 36 every time no matter how big my square gets okay can we assume think about it this way
can we say an area equals a side this is just of a square area of a square area equals a side what do how do you get to 4
you count how many squares are in there okay but what if you do not want to count how many squares
go you would count the sides okay said it can be side plus side and that is how we would do it in 1st grade so what would be a short form of side plus side plus side plus side
4 does that work in both of these examples yes so on a square to find the area how many sides do we need to know to find the area
if i said you have a square and one side is 5 inches long could you tell me what the area of that square would be if i tell you that one side of a square you need to look up here
if one side of a square is 5 inches long could you tell me the area using our formula be red ticket in how can that be different on a square dude me you just told me every side was the same on a square
he said it is 20 because if i told you that the side is 55 times 4 40 what if the side was 6 24 what if the side was 4
16 so now we magically know what we can do okay let us look at the same square and say okay we know what our formula is for our square our area parameter how did you come up with the parameter
1st i counted all the sides which are all equal there are 4 sides so i did 3 times 4 which equals 12 she said i added all the sides but she knows the sides are all equal right she said i know there is 3 on each side and how many sides are there
4 okay on this one how did you come up with the parameter here because each side has 2 okay and i counted 2 for each side and how many sides were there
8 how many sides on a square okay is that what we got for the parameter so already knows if i look at this and i look at this can i come up with a formula for parameter of a square
be what is the 3 in this one and the 2 in this one represent think about it
what does the 2 represent in this equation and what does the 3 represent in that equation the side okay so says this represents the side think says so i have got a side and what does that 4 represent
number of sides the number of sides in every square right yes so a side hang on just a minute the side times 4 would equal what 12 well it is going to be different for every one but if i said the side times 4 is going to equal what
e you do not have a number
okay here the area is equal to what is our side here
i side times 4 is our area wrong we did not add the 4 together
9 so it is side times side equals the area and that is why you guys are staring at me now because we just did that side times 4 equals the parameter okay over here we do side times side and we get the area side times 4 is the parameter that gives you what is inside versus what is around the area
3 how many sides on a square 4 12 that is your parameter 3 how many is on the other side area let us try another one
yes one i am breathing under water a little bit you are breathing under water a little bit one take one tile pull it out
have look at the one you pulled out okay one all right
tile each side is equal to one okay how many tiles do you have there one that is your area right there so your area is one
one times one look at your formula side times side gives you the whole thing that is side times side equals the area parameter how many edges do you have
4 pull out the single tile go you have 4 edges right yes so the side one times how many sides one how many sides
4 equals your parameter so your parameter is 4 4 okay yes
on the 1st one that is an s side them how many sides do you have 4 so what is your parameter
okay how is there one left out pile we are only dealing with this only dealing with a single tile we are dealing with a single tile with an area of one and a parameter of what
4 go back and make your square again out of the 4 tiles tiles all right ready
have you have 4 tiles to make your square all right so your area which is the whole thing all is 4 right 2 how many on this side
okay so to get to that if i take the side times a side what number do i get 4 how many did you tell me you had it yes make it out of 9
3 how many tiles do you have 4
9 how many on each side 3 what is 3 times 3
it yes pretend this is even
4 what is 4 times 4 16 does that formula work
yes so the formula is the area of a square is side times side wrong okay side times side just for a square
right i do not get the sides like are you talking about the sides around the square yeah one 2 3 one 2 3 how many is on each side how is it only 2 sides where is there only 2 sides sweetie you said side times side side times side they are all the same
side times side is going to give you how many is in the middle okay problems you count 5 problems and 5 down and you know that means you have 25 on the page thing this formula gives you how many is in the middle okay
yes the parameter is going to be 12 because to get the parameter you have got to count 4 times around right outside we are only counting outside pieces right edges the area we are counting like this
edges so the parameter of this look at the same thing here we are counting the parameter remember the parameters prance around the edge right yes one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
right 0 i did it wrong did not i 12 i did exactly what i just told you not to do
inside the difference is on this one instead of counting one you have got to count both edges right sense yes so in other words on a square that is on the corner in area that square counts as one parameter you count both sides of it the exposed sides the outer
right yes what is my formula i can plug in for that 3 times 4 is 12 3 3 times 4 square do it this way the same thing how many sides
side did we do that wrong again it is the same as this one
16 okay look at yours count physically it has 9
pencil what did you get 12 see the difference guys
you are basically only counting insides for area and you are counting on the outsides for parameter yes i do not understand how you are able to count the other part because it is square when i count i just get 4
unit pretend that is an inch and i said each side was 3 inches one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 inches it is 3 tiles long but if you said it was inches then it would make sense right okay that is what i am saying
right so let us do a practice one tiles if i told you this is our area
tell me again what my formula is for my area of a square side times side if i told you that the side of are you listening
if i told you that the side of a square was 5 units 5 inches let us say 5 inches if the side of the square was 5 inches what would my area be
inches i have got to multiply it by the side right 25 let us do the same thing for parameter if i told you that the side one side of a square was 5 inches that means we would know that every side is 5 inches right because the square is the same all the way around
if one side is 5 inches what would my parameter be 20 i know we are just changing over from geometry to algebra from yesterday it is kind of a mind shift mind it is really a lot easier i think you guys are trying to make it into an algebraic type solution
you think i am going to do a multiplicative inverse on you any 2nd now not it is what it is the thing is the reason we have these formulas is so we do not have to count them all what if it is huge no if i put you in a room that had tiles on the floor that were in squares and it was a square room and i said count these
faster to count one edge and multiply it times 4 yes for parameter or count one edge and multiply it by itself side times side to get the area right yes so let us try one more
if i told you that the side of a square was 7 inches long what would the area be
board if the side is 7 inches long what would the area be i am asking for the area what would the area be if the one side is 7 inches long 3
area if one side is 7 inches long what would the area of that square be if i am asking you for the area if one side is 7 inches long what would the area be 49 guys the formula is at the board
tiles on that same square what would the parameter be
5 i do not know where you got the 5 long 7 times 4 is 28
yes i still do not get the side why do not you just put the number what number instead of side and side because we are putting the numbers in but this is your formula so any number i give you you can do it
any number i give you you should be able to find the formula if you know the area is side times side formula like the formula for division of fractions is the 1st fraction is the multiplicative inverse of the 2nd fraction
anymore let us try again if you touch the tiles again i am slapping them off the desk okay they are a tool not a toy and i should not have to say that to 5th graders
okay if one side of a square is 12 inches long what is the area you i am not ever going to write anything up there what is the area of a square if one side is 12 inches long
board
what is the formula for parameter of a square side times side times what is that what is written for parameter of a square
12 what is the parameter of a square that has one side that is 12 inches long 48 guys i do not know where you are going today
all what are you all not getting about this if you have one side all you need on a square is one side side if you have one side then you have all the information you need for parameter and for area and we proved it you counted them for me then we said okay that makes sense
if we have 12 then we know we are going to have 12 times 12 is 144 squares what if it is 20
20 what is my computation for area there 20 times 20 20 times 20 what is the parameter for that same thing if one side is 20
80 thank you 20 times 4 is 80 guys this is edges this is the whole thing in the middle okay
great let us do tell me if one side is 15 you do not have to do the math if one side is 15 what is the area you what is the parameter
number 15 times 4
16 okay what is the parameter if one side is 4
up 7 times 7 is 40 49 okay who does not get this yet lost that right there all right
squares everybody put the 9 back up the square made of 9 9 count the number of tiles
okay so you have got 3 on each side right and what was the number you told me that it counted up to 2s in other words 4 squares 2 and 2 4 how much is on each side
2 is that what you got one you see how that works time how many sides do you have
4 how many is on each side one there is your parameter okay 4 if you put it in 4 how many is on each side
80 but if one side is 20 what is it yes there is not parameter times area
things i mean how is there parameter on a one tile 4 that would be the parameter does that make sense okay do you feel real good about squares sleep i wake you up and i say the side is 2 you are going to say the parameter is 4
8 side is 2 side is 2 8 side is 2 the area is 4 it yes what do we do with triangles we are not doing it with triangles right now basic everybody feels good with this right
yes i am trying to decide whether when do we get to circles yes we will get to circles we are going to get to circles but let us hold ourselves to our squares right now squares let us leave our formula up there okay
on i want you to make a rectangle out of 2 going this way and 5 going this way okay 2 and 5
i have got 2 and i have got 5 this like that
okay what is the area you missed one tile i asked for area 1st
what is the area count them 10 okay so the area of this is 10 10 that is the area right 2 how many go the other way
5 okay just leave that there we will get you another one it is all right we will grab one
back okay listen so we know area equals 10 count the parameter j double check guys
what is the parameter of 14 are you counting inches you have got to count the edges 14 all right
what buddy look 14 you have got to count all the edges okay
babe what did you get edge count the edges buddy look 140
guys on the corners you have to count both edges of that square edges make the same thing 2 times 4
2 okay
area okay somebody count the parameter
12 you can not have an let us do one more
3 i know what it is area 2 times 3 10 all right look at those 3 numbers and look at the figures that go with them
can we come up with a formula for the area of a rectangle what is it
no a formula buddy that is going to work with every one a formula that will work with every single one when you say side times side the problem with that is with square all the sides are the same length you are on the right track but on a square all the sides are the same length
on this one we have 2 sides that are 2 and 2 sides that are 5 and 2 sides that are 4 and 2 sides that are 3 yes side times 2 side the side that is going that way will that work with any rectangle i draw
what if i draw one that is 3 going this way and 5 going that way okay i need a formula that is going to work for any rectangle playing look on the numbers that are on every single one of those and look at the area number
when the area was 10 and when the area was 8 and when the area was 6 yes what is this called area no
the area for a square and the area for a rectangle can not be the same thing because the area for a square has 4 equal sides rectangle it has uneven sides what do you mean uneven be more specific
rectangle that 2 sides of a rectangle are the same what are the other 2 they can be anything wait a minute do not go further you are telling me that i can have a rectangle with 2 sides the same like these 2 can be the same and these 2 can be different no
okay so what all of them are the same no they are not all the same did i draw one all the same
as on the bottom and on the sides okay listen what said was the top and the bottom are the same and both sides are the same
way it is called length and the short way is called width can we come up with a formula for how to get the area ticket length times width area of a rectangle
examples every single time is length times width the answer area is 10 length is 5 width is 2 area is 8 length is 4 width is 2 area is 15 length is 5 width is 3 area is 6 width is 2 length is 3
okay now i am sorry yes parameter now a little bit different because again we are adding the edges and the edges here remember the side was all the same
4 over here we do not have 4 sides that are the same 2 we have 2 that are the same here and 2 that are the same here right
that think what if i said how many sides do i have that are the same 4 how many sides are the same on a rectangle
2 okay what if i said so my width is the same right yes so my width times 2 do i have something else that is the same
yes what else is the same on all of them same so could i add my length to my width i have to multiply my length times 2 also right okay does this work
it on this one we said my parameter was 14 right width width is 5 times 2 plus what was my length i mean sorry my width was 2
5 5 times 2 because i have 2 sides that are 5 right 14 is that what we got when we just counted the edges
4 okay
width what is 4 times 2 that is that what we got when we counted all the edges one how many sides do i have that are 3
2 so we can say 3 times 2 and on this one it is the width okay 2 5 times 2
16 magic 2 it is always going to be 2
2 and i have 2 sides that are 2 right magic make sense guys now yeah breathing good
me which one area the area the area on this one remember we did side times 4 sorry we did side times side because on a square all the sides were the same okay on a rectangle all the sides are not the same
we can not do side times side because it is not the same but what we can do is we can do length times width because we know there is only 2 measurements measurement if we do that that will give us everything in the middle sides you are still doing sides but you just have to identify which side it is because on the square they are all the same one side 2 side 3 side 4
on a rectangle you only have 2 sides that are the same and the other 2 sides are the same width when we started talking about side times side or side times this you can not do side
together these 3 words we took some time talking about this morning they are equilateral isosceles and scalene
there s 3 more words that we re going to be using today or really terms that we re going to be using today bottom we re going to be using right angle acute angle and obtuse angle so i m going to start reading at the top and then i ll be calling on volunteers to take us through the rest of the information up here many words are used to describe triangles we will use these words today
can you please read the information about an equilateral triangle all sides are the same length all angles are the same angle good all sides are the same length all angles are the same measure just as a review each angle is worth how many degrees
degrees and we know that all angles will add up to 180 degrees good okay let s go on to isosceles pick a friend to read that information please today isosceles 2 sides are the same length 2 angles are the same measure the 3rd side and angle are different yes
information isosceles 2 sides are the same length measure but the 3rd side and the 3rd angle are different triangle and the last information pick a friend for scalene scalene all sides are different all angles are different very good
all sides are different lengths all angles are different measures but always adding up to 180 degrees okay let s take a look at the bottom information and i want to ask you how many degrees there are in a right angle if a triangle has one right angle how many degrees is that angle worth
this is some prior knowledge that hopefully you re bringing to 5th grade from last year correct can you guys show me with your hands what a 90 degree angle looks like yes it s an exact corner like the edge of a piece of paper angle i like the l s either backwards or forwards or upside down
doesn t matter as long as it s an exact corner just like the edge of a piece of paper this is what 90 degrees looks like 90 with a little symbol for degrees so we re okay on that
angle an acute angle is an angle less than what number belongs in there again so an acute angle is less than 90 degrees so this is a right angle which way should my arms move if i want to show an acute angle together these are all acute angles within here
and kind of has her fingers coming together like that and that works as well we re going to be using acute today then the last term up here is obtuse an obtuse angle i think we can do this together an angle greater than 90 degrees so they all have to do with 90 degrees but show our right angle which way are my arms moving to show obtuse angles
they re going this way almost like i m ready to fall over smaller right angles are equal to 90 degrees ready to move on down we re all set with our angles right i want to go to this page
i have 3 different triangles up here them an orange a blue and a red we are going to identify these triangles one of them is equilateral one of them is isosceles the 3rd one is scalene and then we re going to practice marking the sides and angles to show when they are the same and when they are different
who thinks that they can come up and label for me cross our fingers that their spelling is going to be correct let s go with equilateral 1st yet equilateral let s see if he can find it there are some cards over on our math word wall if you need help with spelling
the best way to remember equilateral is equal good job s very nice that is an equilateral triangle now can you pass that to a friend who can mark the sides to indentify the sides as being equal
those are going to be the little marks that we re going to be using today
job she s showing me that all of those 3 sides are the same because they all have the same mark in them good you re going to pass that to a friend who can identify angles as being equal
you did a good job but there s just one more extra detail that i would add who knows what that detail is what do you think we can add to those little curves that he put in there 90 not a 90 because they re not we could write 60 degrees are you listening
that why don t you write outside the circle so you can write nice and big like it s a little circle so go ahead and add that in there
information the last little detail that i was thinking we could add is just even a mark in these angles to show that they re equal just like we did for the sides are we all set on equilateral okay equilateral check next pick a friend to come up and identify the isosceles triangle
all eyes should be up on the board and focused good job bringing your card to check your spelling yes he did identify the isosceles triangle
you re going to pass it to a friend who is going to help us mark our sides the lengths of our sides
not 2 are the same the 3rd one is not so our marks are going to look different than they did in the equilateral triangle what do you think we should do to the 3rd side anything nothing we should put 2 lines on the 3rd side
we could leave it blank but marking it with 2 lines really shows that yep these are not the same next pick a friend 2 angles are the same the 3rd one is not them
it s going to be a little hard to see what s in the blue but we should be able to handle it
2 angles that are the same the other is not so he identified the angle but do we know which 2 are the same a which one is not we don t yet not the way that he identified them
you you identified the angle but not that 2 are the same and the 3rd is not
one there good one there and what about the top one blank let me fix that up guys
you did it correctly i just want to fix it up so that it s easily able to be seen seat i m just going to change the color so that we can see because we need to practice this the correct way because this is what we re doing today mark nice and big with a mark right through it and then the top one nice and big with 2 marks
better ready for the last triangle done we would need to get a protractor to measure these angles which we re not going to do right now up bringing his cards to check his spelling
it thank you
scalene do you want to take care of the lengths of the sides or just did you want to pass it off to a friend pass it off to a friend so somebody needs to come up here and show me these marks on the side i wonder what they look like for a scalene triangle
knows very nice job j he put one there 2 here and 3 over here meaning none of them are the same
angles pick a friend and i m going to change the color are you ready for the angles i think orange will be able to been seen pretty easily
there s one angle there s another angle and there s our 3rd but right now they kind of look like they re all the same
friend can you go faster so we can try to finish this up up 123 that s what i was looking for to show that none of them are the same they re all different
okay do you understand okay what about angles here i don t see any right angles angles i want you to talk at your tables about where you see the acute angles i m just going to highlight them with a little dot
we re looking for smaller than 90 degrees this one here yes it is so i m just going to put a little dot on it no this one is not going to be an obtuse angle we would really have to take out a protractor to measure it exactly it could be a right angle but it could be like that many degrees off
so we re not sure about that one but this one we re definitely sure this is an acute angle here yes this is an acute angle smaller than 90 degrees this one here yes acute here yes we know because 60 degrees is obviously less than
9090 so they re all acute over here i m thinking that this one if we did measure it it would be scalene not scalene obtuse
them any last questions okay i m going to give you guys a practice problem to do and a partner to work with today you want to take your math book with you
out we re going to need a ruler i ll ask to pass those out maybe in another minute or 2 when we get settled my group that i would like to meet at the back
back table you guys can read over your directions while you wait
close and you need one more thing for today and that is centimeter grid paper you re going to be using rulers using those rulers to draw triangles i have enough for 2 pieces of paper per person
person the triangles that you re going to be drawing are a through f on this paper you re going to be using your ruler following those measurements
f i think i will leave paper why don t i leave paper in 2 piles right here and you can get it with your group member when you re ready for it
all right guys
ruler actually that would be great all right guys we re going to start on the side that says triangles top let s start by just quickly reviewing the 3 different kinds of triangles
you guys are going to be responsible for numbering these words the definition of these words is not always going to be there for you so you really have to try and remember them so we know that an equilateral triangle all sides are the same length and all angles have the same measure how are we going to remember that s what an equilateral triangle is
we can think of that s the definition but what is a trick that we can use to remember in our head what an equilateral triangle actually is equal right you know what equal is
equal means the same so an equilateral triangle we can remember that that s the triangle that everything is the same this one they all have they re all the same and then inside they re all the same as well okay isosceles means at least 2 sides are the same length
different and at least 2 measures are the same length which means the 3rd one is different then the last why don t you read that one for us scalene triangle no sides are the same length with a scalene no sides are the same length are you okay on that directions this is a pretty challenging activity so we need to take our time
1st we need to name each triangle by the length of its sides so triangle a has one side that is 3 centimeters another side that is 5 centimeters and then the 3rd side is also 3 centimeters so what kind of triangle would it be an equilateral isosceles or scalene
says isosceles says isosceles why isosceles because like it how do you tell it s isosceles go ahead
because it says exactly there s 2 that are 3 and only one that s 5 so 2 are the same and one is different so let s write isosceles on that line for triangle a
that s an isosceles triangle those words are right up at the top so practice your spelling now we re going to go to our centimeter grid paper and we re going to try to draw it
centimeters the 3rd side is 5 centimeters ruler why don t you and i work on this together you guys try to see what you can do by yourself and then we ll check in
what i would do just as a strategy is i would really concentrate on these grid lines and make at least one side of the triangle centimeters is going to be our blue side
inches is the red side so centimeters will be the blue because it s centimeter grid paper each one is a centimeter which makes it easy for us take a pencil and draw a line just along the side of the ruler
good the other also needs to be 3 you can only go up to where the 3 mark is on the ruler and then we have to try to be as neat as possible
5 we re going to have to rework it this is what we re going to have to do we re going to have to do 5 on the bottom and then 3 and 3 coming up on each side
tricky tricky huh
are you doing okay
pencil you got it you need to check your work there
it s really tricky what did you guys come up with way you have to be using your ruler because polygons have very very very straight sides
example so this triangle here we made the base of our triangle 5 centimeters and then each of these sides going up was 3 centimeters so these are our 2 sides that are equal and that s the 3rd one that is not thing you need to make your base which is the bottom 5 centimeters yep
put your ruler on the grid line and then you have to try and get it so that your 3 centimeters are even on each side strategy in the middle of the base
so when you go to do your 3 centimeters you have to position so the 3 matches up with that line turning see how that s just about 3 do the other side
let me see that s going to end up being scalene if you do it that way i want you to try and stay on the grid line you re a little bit above it this is what and i just did
be right about here so what do we do with 3 centimeters we want to try to get it from that edge to that line in the middle
that s 3 centimeters can i help you with something
question okay we re going to write isosceles is where i want you to use the graph paper
i made those directions clear and i also went over them i said a through f
isosceles triangle for each of these we just want to make sure that we re always using our little marks to show when 2 sides are the same and when the 3rd one is not
when 2 angles are the same and the 3rd one is not we always want to try to do that
to show that they re different and we want to mark it with the letter a because that was triangle a
okay are you guys ready for b if you do 11 and one you re telling me that that and that are all the same
not that one is different so we re going to do a 2 through that do you understand and you re getting better at your little marks right a don t make it too complicated the simpler the better
so let s finish up a so that we can move on to triangle b okay guys let s go on to b
letter b is right on the right side of letter a and the measurements that we need for letter b are 14 centimeters 9 centimeters and 8 centimeters what kind of triangle would have 14 centimeters 9 and 8 we all can say it it is scalene
there letter b is scalene now we have to try to draw it
rulers ruler go ahead okay so there s 14
so there s 14 there s 8 and now the last one okay mark that one with a b
room make sure that you have your tally marks labeled and you guys can move on to c together
i ll be right back
okay come on over here guys you guys are going to work together on this
this is your paper page this line is challenging because you have to draw these triangles but then they re exactly those same measurements so it takes a lot of planning out
can i talk to this group so i don t know if you want to start with this guys or start with this side late but for this side when you go to draw your triangles you have to use rules on centimeter grid paper so that they re really as close to those measurements as you can get them
he s helping you on b
huh you got it
good girl remember it s scalene so they re going to be different good job labeling your angles but are those yeah so they all have there you go
you can move on to c if you re ready okay so this is your 14 here right rulers that was easy
is we ll use that as the gauge to help us so the middle of the triangle is right about here
so we know that one of them is going to be 9 so it s going to be a little bit past where the middle is and the other one will be 8 here so we re going to hope that this will be our 9 centimeter side and then let s try to see if this isn t that right about 8 yeah so that s kind of how you have to play it
you have to look for the middle draw a dot where you think you want your to go and then you can make your final decision
so that s going to be our 9
matter so put a one on that side a 2 on that side and a 3 on that side and you can go ahead and label your angles and also give it a name
if you get frustrated drawing your triangle that s not going to help you tricky you have to plan it out and sketch it out 1st
right if you work together it might make it a little bit easier on you here getting your work done
tricky i would suggest the base the bottom of the triangle the 14 centimeters it doesn t have to be we have plenty of room and plenty of paper so you might want to try to slide it would a little bit more you re going to stay right on the grid right that s going to be really helpful for you if you stay right on those grid lines
so what i mean by staying on the grid lines is you want to draw a line right where there already are lines you don t just want to invent them so go ahead and do a 14 centimeter line across okay now this is what i suggested to the other group
together so you want to try to find the middle of this base make one of your lines going up to be 9 and the other one will hopefully be 8 this is really a strategy that you re going to be able to use for the rest of them so watch so the middle of it is going to be right on this line here
base so one of our sides is going to be 9 centimeters which is going to go a little bit up half past the middle mark and this is what i would do draw a little dot where you think you want your 9 centimeters to go and then measure the rest of it
8 let s just adjust our dot a little bit so we ll be able to get it right on our 9 is from there to there see that
so it s possible you guys just have to really try to plan it out
okay i ll be right there we can get other paper
what do you guys need help with i don t understand how you can get the triangles to actually go on the paper like how do you get them to you guys aren t using they don t have to be exactly perfect but they should be pretty close
it how are we supposed to have 5 and 6 made up i would suggest for you guys i can see that you re not drawing right on the grid and i would suggest doing that so when i say write on the grid that means drawing lines where there already are lines so let me see your pencil and let s get our base to be along this measurement which will be 7
then what i suggested to the other groups is trying to find where the middle of this is which would be right about here base so you re going to kind of plan where you want one side 6 centimeters to probably come past the middle because it s the longer side other do you see how that would kind of plan it out that way
so let s say that our 6 centimeters is going to go to right there
5 you have to plan it out help that s why i m having you use grid paper and not just white paper
it all right guys i m going to give you 5 more minutes on your practice book page and then we re going to come back together
one i think you can go back and do your marks and your angles i don t see any on this i don t see any down there i don t see any angles so check and make sure you need larger paper for f
i was hoping the 24 would fit on there you could do it on the back
we have plenty of centimeter paper so you can get more when you need it okay the big one you re going to need larger paper for
this one won t fit on the paper if you do it right on the bottom you can do it on larger paper there s construction paper back there that you can do it on
work stick to it a couple more minutes guys
try to draw maybe one more triangle and then we ll come back together
i have a problem with the way you re drawing your triangles this is not a triangle because it has 12345 sides
pentagon how many sides are on a triangle sides so i can see that you just did that because you wanted to close your triangle in but when you do that and you add an extra line you re making it more than 3 sides
together let s go back to a
5 and we need to find the middle of this because each of our 3 centimeter lines is going to come right up to the middle
here so we need 13 centimeter coming up there and our other 3 centimeter coming down to right there we re going to do one more minute and then we ll come back together
up that s where i need it to be right so i m just going to turn the ruler as much as i need to now this is on 3 and that s connecting to the middle so that ll give me my 3 centimeters
why don t you draw on the other side you know it s going to be 3 so you don t have to measure it any more
is now that s a triangle right make sure when you go back to your desks you re bringing all your papers with you
you can pass your rulers in responsibly and carefully
it has your name on it desk we have a couple of minutes before recess that we re going to spend talking about the work that we did today
i want to start on the side where you had to draw the triangles on centimeter grid paper
hard the hard part was drawing them on the centimeter grid paper a what did you have to draw for letter a not inches 3 centimeters 5 centimeters and 3 other centimeters
not your math handbooks your vocabulary books but we will get to that in a minute
in i am going to shut down the lights a little bit so that we can see the board a little bit better what we are going to be doing today is reviewing surface area surface area is a concept we worked on a few weeks back
so today we are going to spend a little bit of time reviewing how to find the surface area of a cube 3 d objects that look like that and of rectangular prisms you will see a picture of a rectangular prism in another moment here is how to find the surface area of a cube
minutes i want you to read over this information yourselves
sets the surface area of a cube is the area of the 6 squares that cover it the surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one square cube therefore there are 6 squares
in order to find the surface area of the cube all you have to do is find the area of one square and multiply that by 6 who can tell me the length width and height of my cube
ahead the length the width and the height of the cube is 3 centimeters everything is the same high in order to find the area of one of those squares i multiply the length and the width
i multiply 3 centimeters by 3 centimeters and i get a product of 9 square centimeters that means that the surface of one of these cubes is 9 square centimeters it is a 3 by 3
that is its surface in order to find the surface of all sides of the cube i am taking 9 and i am multiplying it by 6 9 times 6 is 54 the surface area of that cube is 54 square centimeters 54 little boxes would cover this whole cube
54 of them one surface area 9 how did i get that 9
3 3 times 3 is 9 centimeters times centimeters is square centimeters 9 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 9 square centimeters good question another question how would you get the 6 for 9 square centimeters times 6
6 i multiply 9 by 6 because a cube has 6 faces 3 those are the squares that we can see here there is one on the bottom and there is one on that side over there
6 faces 6 squares any other questions let us move onto rectangular prisms time please read over all of this information and be ready to discuss it
time rectangular faces rectangular sides
let us review this information in the blue it says the surface area of a rectangular prism that is the 3 d figure i have there is the area of the 6 rectangles that cover it find the area of each rectangle then add those areas together so i have a lot of numbers up here and a lot of labels this time my length my width and my height are different
who can tell me my length my width and my height a the length is 4 the width is 5 and the height is 3 the length is 4 centimeters the width is 5 centimeters and the height is 3 centimeters nice job dimensions let us just talk about one rectangle right now
and i want to talk about this top rectangle if i wanted to find the area of just this top face there that top rectangle i would multiply 5 and 4 together i would multiply 5 centimeters by 4 centimeters and i would get 20 square centimeters
top the bottom face on this rectangular prism is exactly the same as the top congruent that is why i multiply 20 by 2 20 on the top far yes how did you get 2
2 because the top face is 20 square centimeters and the bottom face is 20 square centimeters 20 everybody is making that connection now that now let us talk about the other sides 5 and 3 let us talk about this rectangle and the one in the back those are also going to be congruent
good 5 centimeters times 3 centimeters got me 15 centimeters for this one all i have to do was double it to get the one in the back 30 so now i have my top and my bottom and i have 2 sides go on a rectangular prism there are 6 rectangles
sides we are talking about this one and the one in the back this one here in order to find the area i am multiplying 4 and 3 4 times 3 is 12 i am going to double 12 to make up for the rectangle on the other side
12 times 2 is 24 my last step is to add these 3 numbers together and i will get the entire surface area if you unfolded that rectangular prism if you unfolded it into its pattern we have worked before with patterns and folding patterns and putting them together to make boxes
if you unfolded that you would be looking at 94 square centimeters a how would you multiply the 3 and the 4 how did i multiply the 4 into 3 to find the area of this rectangle right here 4 it has a height of 3 and a width of 4
together the faces on a rectangular prism are not all congruent to each other are on a prism no they are not so you have to make sure you find the area of each and then add all those areas together
yes i am going to help you with the 1st couple of problems together but eventually you guys are going to have a ticket to leave a ticket to go onto the next activity review this is where we are going to take out our math vocabulary notebooks and we are going to put this example in them
now find a nice clean blank page if you can not find your math vocabulary notebook today you will have to write on a piece of paper you can travel responsibly to the back in order to get that paper you either are getting out your vocabulary book or you are getting a piece of paper
i really like how you are not even wasting any time it the information on the board is exactly what we are going to be adding to our notebook excellent job getting us started
5 18 12 so you can make the heading of this page to find the surface area of a cube or rectangular prism
heading look this one has a little corner cut out from it
it after you are done writing down step one please put your pencil down so that i know you are ready too if you have to flip back to this page you want to know what to look for
have surface area at the top or to find the surface area something like that
step number one says calculate the area of each square or rectangle by multiplying the length and width please reread number one
calculate the area of each square or rectangle by multiplying the length and width yes multiply the length and the width to find just the area of one of those squares or rectangles if it is a rectangular prism
one step 2 let us go ahead and write that down step 2 is to add all of our areas together
adding and then step 3 of course we want to check our sum and we want to make sure we have the correct label
page you can try drawing this cube perfect label its dimensions and then show how you would find the surface area area here is another surface here is a 3rd surface
we have 6 surfaces that we need to add together
it going to be a little different for cube than it is for prism easier i think so because all you have to do is really multiply one time and then you are adding that to itself 6 times
drawing to draw a cube in your notebooks you can just draw a square another square and connect
if anybody needs more time to copy this i can come back to this page in a little bit but i want to give you guys a chance to partner up or team up and practice a couple with a friend let us go to our whiteboards and here is your 1st example
i would like you to find for me the surface area of this cube do not put your notebooks away quite yet just in case you need them guys now it is time to turn and talk work with a friend and i will give you a few moments to do that
time you guys are working together right examples surface area all the areas added together
j good discussion did you finish copying that down up every turn just make sure that we are switching off okay how are you doing over here 5 times 5 is going to get you the area for one square
25 so go ahead and finish off your work 25 square centimeters would be one square but we have 6 surfaces 6 you working with and
6 groups remember that step 3 is to check your label so make sure you have the correct label you got step 2 step 3 is 25 5 times 5 is 25
25 times 5 is 125 5 multiply the width well the height the height but why 5
good the surface for one of those the area for one square is 25 square centimeters cube 0 yeah we have to multiply by 6 25 good same thing there are 6 faces on a cube so you have to multiply 25 by 6
6 cubes and rectangular prisms you are really focusing on the number 6 in i see 150 square centimeters there i see it there i see it there there there
it this square on top is a 5 by 5 that gives us 25 square centimeters times the surface area of this cube is 150 square centimeters nice job you ready for another one
on i do not think that is a good idea here is your next example whoever did the last one you have to switch off unless you are working by yourself one so here is another cube
cube please tell me the surface area of this cube
a is in charge of this one
can you trust him yeah zeros this time huh
double check your labels and it looks like everybody is just about finished label you need a number and something to go with it
3 surface area is square centimeters or square inches or square feet or cubic units units nice job in let us see what you came up with for the surface area of this cube
if i unwrapped this cube and i cut it up into its pattern the areas on each of them would come to yes we all have it 600 label cu we know that that stands for cubic units good so we found the area of one side by multiplying 10 by 10
10 times 10 equals 100 cube questions before we move on
leave the next 3 d figure is going to be a prism go surface area of this rectangular prism be ready to check in
talk turn and talk talk talk talk a little bit slower
yep and you are talking about just the top face right now
so the top and the bottom get you 4 might want to stick with that 4 cause that is going to be in your addition sentence in a little while so now we need to talk about the other 4 sides 1st the 10 and the one the 10 and the one face 10 cubic units very good
units 10 times one equals 10 and then the face on the other side of that is going to be congruent so you can then multiply that 10 by 2 2 so you do not want to circle the 10 because you are not done with that sentence this one is a little bit more challenging
work so we have 2 +2 is 4 20 now we need to talk about the faces that are 2 by 10
10 and then the other congruent side circles i see some mixed reviews on this one
i want you to put your caps on your markers and i want you to show me your work look so we have a couple of different answers as i am looking around quickly the directions were caps on your markers
down and i want you to look really really really focus for this one you have another prism problem to do with your friend and then your ticket leave as a prism all on your own go let us talk about the top face and the bottom face to find the area of the top face and the bottom face i want to multiply 2 by one 2 i have an area of 2 on the top
the bottom is going to be congruent the area on the bottom is also going to be 2 for a total of 4 cubic units bottom thumbs up if you got 4 for your top and your bottom sides i am going to highlight now the side that i want to talk about 1st
here and i want to talk about how to find the area of that side i have different dimensions right now very different dimensions 2 this one here this face 0 i mean 10 units by
by one cubic unit yes 10 there is another face on the other side that looks just like that one tell me the dimensions of the face that is on the other side of this yellow face here thing so i can multiply 10 by 2 and i would get 20 cubic units
thumbs up if you had 20 cubic units for those 2 faces go 12 more to go but we really just have to do work for one more because we know what it means to be congruent this base here take a look at the green face here
face thank you 20 is the face on the other side of that going to look just like this congruent so i can just then multiply 20 times 2 and i would get 40
units tell me the last step together i do need to add all those numbers together 40 20 and 4 your surface area for this prism is 64 cubic units job this group here and very good working together
good if you did not get 64 do you have a question go where would it go
one i thought i had one more for you
one so while i make this turn real quick and talk about surface area and make sure you are understanding how to find it
enough yes do you need dimensions not you i will give you a length of 10 cubic units
count do you all know how to count can you count the cubes up to get the height can you do that can you count the cubes across to get the width can you do that so last opportunity to turn and talk go yes that is a prism
prism yep certainly not a cube because not all the sides are congruent do not argue around put the board on your desk so that is able to see it better and so that i am able to see it better
count are you agreeing with everything going down there
floor why do not you do this one on your own just on a scrap piece of paper
good so 2 faces have an area of 50 cubic units so the front face here and the back would be 100 yes so do you want to talk about the top and the bottom or do you want to do the other 2 sides
i think is trying to get this problem done so that he can go on with the rest of his work together i see some people finishing up so let us try to finish up and we are going to have to talk about this one
figure you ready for your ticket in let us see what you came up with
i see 400 cubic units 400 cubic units 400 square units 400 cubic units 400 here also got 400 and a couple of different answers scattered here and there time to put your caps on your markers time to put your marker on your desk
you are not going to use that anymore eyes up here and let us talk about this last one before we have our ticket to leave you the length on this cube not cube rectangular prism is 10 the height the height is
interesting and the width one 2 3 4 5 5 this face here what is the area on this face the area on that face is
units you must have multiplied 5 times 10 here who can tell me the area of this face with nicely labeled dimensions 100 100 cubic units units you must have multiplied 10 and 10 together to get that
top the top of my prism 50 again 10 good you could have doubled this to make up for the bottom giving you the number 100
you could double this number to make up for that other side giving you another 100 you could double this number to make up for the other side giving you 200
correct yes 400 cubic units is it questions i am going to pass out your ticket to leave this ticket will allow you to go onto make break and round with a friend
you do not remember make break and round 0 yeah no i remember erase your boards and i am going to come around and collect those supplies and i would like you to quietly on your own work on this problem
you i am leaving that example up there for a reason it i am going to give you 3 minutes to work on this
own let us go get to work yourself come in
please cover up your work
why i would double check that if i were you time double check your work please please please please please
combinations did your mom find my note last night so you have to only your recess today and i can already see that no improvements are being made
you just had all those opportunities to ask questions to talk with a friend about this and now you are on your own and you look like you are stuck are you taking accountability for your work not you know that you have something to review
area it does not look like you are trying your best that no not right now
name i did not say throw it down
me you had the right answer the 1st time time i thought you said i do not know where your answer is
it so i am going to put you in the good pile if i call your name you are going to go to make break and round if i do not call your name we need to work on this problem
and
goodbye if i did not call your name we are going to work through this problem seat and i want you guys to move up
a i am going to put this problem up on the and we are going to work through it
i am going to be asking you guys for lots of answers lots and lots and lots of answers along make sure you are focused and make sure you are ready for my questions height if i want width be ready to tell me width if i want to know dimensions be ready to tell me those dimensions
understand here is the problem that we were working on we had to find the surface area for this rectangular prism it the width is the width is unfortunately not 5 in this case
you are looking at the length what is the width the width is 17 the way that we are looking at this prism the width equals 17 feet different but the way that we are viewing it it is 17
j the length is the dimension that stretches back prism 8 feet yes it is 8 feet height equals 8 8 feet
correct we just have questions about what numbers to multiply together and what numbers to add together correct yes correct good i am glad that you know where you are having your difficulty guys the 1st step is to find the area of each square or rectangle how many rectangles do you see on this prism
5 i see more than 5 how many rectangles do you see on this prism 6 i see 6 as well cube there are 6 faces on a rectangular prism
6 at the end of this activity we have 6 numbers that we need to add together rectangles we need to talk about these rectangles and we need to find the area of these rectangles i am going to highlight the rectangle that i want you to give me dimensions for the rectangle that i just highlighted tell me its dimensions please
5 yes it is a 5 by 17 it is 5 tall and it is 17 wide 17 what is 5 times 17
go 85 square feet is going to be it
85 square feet is the area of just that one rectangle how many more rectangles do we have to go
66 how many have we found 11 how many more to go area we still need to do some work do not we yes now this is the strategy that you guys could use should you choose to use it you know on the other side of this prism there is another rectangle that looks exactly like that blue one
j yeah did you know that on the back side of that rectangular prism is another rectangle that looks just like that one yeah because opposite faces on prisms are congruent other can you very quickly tell me the area of the rectangle on the opposite side of this blue one 85 square feet do you agree with that
that because 5 times 17 is 85 and the dimension 85 squares it is going to be the exact same thing can we add 85 +85 to take care of 2 rectangles
in what is my total going to be
put this down here you all set today we are going to continue working on dividing with decimals which we started talking about yesterday when we talked about powers of 10 today as we work i want you to think about the division strategies that we used when we divided with whole numbers
some of you have said you feel more comfortable with one strategy over the others so you have got to think about what strategies did i feel most comfortable with when i was dividing whole numbers and how may i need to change those ideas or revise those ideas or extend those strategies to work with dividing numbers that have decimals in them are we clear
we are also going to talk about what we did yesterday which is a relationship between division and multiplication i am going to put 2 problems on the board
problem 18 divided by 6 equals 18 divided by 6 tenths equals exactly if i asked you how to write these 2 problems with a missing factor how would i do that so is it going to be division or multiplication we are talking about factors of multiplication
one excellent would you like to come and do the next one is reads length times 6 equals 18
so factor times another factor equals 18 work the unknown factor times 6 tenths equals 18
we are going to use running as a context again and since likes to run which we learned in his story we are going to use do you want to read your problem actually in a level 4 voice please and ran 18 miles in how many days he ran 18 miles in all
day he ran 18 miles in all run can you visualize this in your head
perfect it is perfect 0 someone is being critical line we are always looking at the whole story the number line is telling me i did not want to write one
you have a number line and i want to show that ran 6 miles a day all how many days did he run who thinks they can come up here and show us how far ran on the 1st day
hands how far did run on the 1st day up remember when we have number lines we have to label what else what does the jump show
exactly can you repeat what you just said how did you know where to stop
he ran 6 miles a day what would you label the top what day one
down i see a lot of thumbs up but i see that why do you disagree 0 yeah did it say that ran a mile before he even started tracking this how can you revise this to make it more accurate
let us count this on the number line the number of miles one 2 3 4 5 6 no one 2 3 4 5 it erase the part that you need to
thing do you agree now or disagree who would like to show day 2 of running
up you do not have to label them all see label them all if you need to
they agree with you on the 1st day he ran 6 miles on the 2nd day he still ran 6 miles but he is ran a total of 12
up who knows
yet are we going to be able to answer your question
it how many days did run days you are saying the quotient to that problem is 3
that yes line come and show us 18
is just here no up to here
is right here yeah because each day was a total of 6 miles right is that is right
day if each day was a separate day that equals a total of 3 days sense now let us imagine that did not run 6 miles a day he ran 6 tenths of a mile each day he still ran 18 miles in all and i want to know how many days did he run
problem what is the only thing i need to change right all we need to change is ran 6 tenths of a mile a day
run how would i show this now on this number line up before she does this do you think our answer is going to be more than 3
raise your hand or give a thumbs down if you think the answer is going to be less than 33 people say the answer is going to be more than 3 why
because if there is 10 parts in each mile then 10 parts in each mile it would have to be more because it is not just a whole number so he is running less than a mile a day and before you are saying he was running more than a mile a day
mean if he is running less than a mile today why is my answer going to be greater than 3 because it takes more days for him to run it jumps it would take more days to run 18 miles if he is running less every day would not it
absolutely so would you label this 6 tenths or down here line she made more marks why did she make more marks on the number line
because it is smaller 0.6 or 6 tenths is less it is definitely less than 6 but it is less than a whole exactly on 6 tenths one.2 and one.8
6 i am going to stop there because remember when he ran 6 miles a day he stopped at 6
how many days you are doing a good job arrows we have listed them for you and it is hard to be precise when the marks are not there how many days did it take to run 6 miles before it took him a day to run 6 miles
if he did 6 tenths of a mile a day how many days did it take him to get to 6 miles
10 it took him one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 days i am going to ask you to scoot for a 2nd it took him 10 days to even run 6 miles
work she is stopping on multiples of what right it is a little bit challenging but she kept with it so for the next 6 miles how many days did we have more how many are total in 12 miles 20 and how about in those last 6 miles
10 so total how many days did it take to run 18 miles 30 so 18 divided by 6 tenths is 30 days
reasonable yes does 30 times 0.6 equal 18 why does that equal why does 30 times 0.6 equal 18
i am going to want to hear from you think
you you think this is equal to 18 why because it is the same as 3 times 6 but it is just that the 6 is divided by 10 and the 3 got 10 times bigger
the 3 where 0 you are saying that my answers or my quotients got 10 times larger that is a good observation my quotient got 10 times larger we think back to yesterday when we were talking about powers of 10
10 so the quotient needs to get 10 times larger a i think you see 3 wholes and that there is 30
3 if you are going to get to 18 you need 3 more tenths to get to 18
so you have to make that 10 times larger too excellent thinking back to our rule yesterday how would i multiply this whole number by a decimal how would i multiply these remembers multiply them by whole numbers i can multiply them like they are whole numbers what are the factors
30 times 6 what you have to drop the 0 because 0.6 is who can explain the decimal you guys came up with this rule a day or 2 ago
m there is a decimal at the end of the whole number an imaginary decimal yeah the space you leave the number of spaces on that number behind the decimal you are saying there is one place left in this decimal so what do i have to make sure my product has
right it then becomes what instead of 180 sense yes do we agree with this yes so just like we did when we were multiplying going to get rid of this multiplying decimals when we are dividing decimals we are going to use strategies that we already know
we are going to think back to unit one think of all the division strategies we did in unit one think of the one you are most comfortable with which is where your name currently is the division strategy you feel most comfortable with
you are going to divide these like they are whole numbers at 1st the same way you came up with that rule for multiplying decimals and both of your rules your 1st step was to multiply the factors like they are whole numbers right thing i am going to show you not forgetting the 2nd part is my answer reasonable
based on the problem does this answer seem reasonable l read this problem we do not say 0.7 remember 7 tenths equals blank times 7 tenths equals let us think about this problem for a 2nd
we are going to estimate as well today so thinking about what this quotient will be approximately do you think the answer will be approximately one
10 approximately 100 i see some people who are unsure how do you know what the answer the quotient if it is going to be approximately one 10 or 100
partner eyes to eyes how do you know what you think the answer will be why explain it to
interesting you think 10 explain what did say
because 105 if we think about it as whole numbers is equal to 10
okay eyes and ears up here
18 so the answer has to be greater than 10 you think okay what do we think a i think the answer is going to be greater than 100 100 is thinking more than 10 but not too much more
100 you are saying 7 tenths is just a little less than one whole mile and you are bringing it back to a story context which is a perfect thing to do when you are thinking about what the answer will be sorry 105 divided by one the answer would be 105
if he ran less than a mile a day is it going to take him more days to get to 105 miles or less days more so actually thinks the product is going to be greater than 105 no someone else who wants to comment on this are you just agreeing or wanting to comment disagreeing okay
disagree because 7 tenths to a whole number i do 7 times 10 you are using you are going to use a division strategy and you are going to use groups of the divisor you are saying if this is 7 times 10 that would be 70
5 times 7 and if you add 5 more tenths or 5 more sevenths it would be 105 105 so you said the answer was going to be what
one.5 you add 15 to it you you are saying to add another group 5 groups of 7 and that is 35 groups so i have 15 groups of 7
you think your answer is going to be you think the answer even though when i add these 2 factors i get 15 you think the quotient to this is one.5 a i thought she said 70 times 5 no she said 7
divisor let us think about this for a 2nd because it seems like we have a few different quotients going on here if i think about this problem 105 divided by 7 tenths what would be a reasonable answer 15 what do you think would be a reasonable answer
is speaking so eyes on her why 105 divided by 7 tenths is 15
you think it is but i also want you to think if the answer to 105 divided by 7 is 15 is it possible that 105 divided by 7 tenths is 15 too does that seem reasonable to you too bit i do not understand it
either eyes and ears up here
please what do we think some people are saying they are still not really sure here i have not heard from you
15 why the reason i think it is 15 is 105 divided by 7 i think it is approximately 15 based on the work we did up here which was based on groups of the divisor we said the answer to this is 15
d if the quotient for 105 divided by 7 is 15 is it possible that the quotient for 105 divided by 7 tenths is the same thing answer i want you to think about that j i think it is one and 5 tenths
why 70 +35 is i can not hear you
15 with decimals you put a point in front of the 7
you are using what we came up with rules for multiplying decimals multiplying like whole numbers count the number of places add that number of places in your final answer
a i think it is 15 because 10 divided by 7 is equal 3 and it is like the algorithm then 35 divided by 7 is equal to 5 so you divided them like whole numbers but could i ignore the decimals when i am multiplying decimals
disagree because because is thinking back to yesterday when we were looking at the powers of 10 were the decimals for multiplication and division moving in the same direction
she is thinking back to the powers of 10 and the patterns 15 then you know that in division the smaller the pieces the bigger the thing is then you multiply 15 times 10 and it is 150
is using reasoning about decimals he knows that 105 divided by 7 equals 15 but he remembers from yesterday that when the number got smaller the quotient maybe it could not be 15 but it could be 150
disagree we use whole we turned the equation into 105 divided by 7 and that equals 15 but the real equation is 105 divided by 7 tenths and you have to make 710 times smaller so you have to make 1510 times larger
that he said this is this the divisor or dividend times so what happens to our quotient 10 times bigger which we noticed yesterday agreeing think back to is context about running
if he ran 7 miles a day and ran a total of 105 it would take him 15 days to do it tired he runs less in a day cold he runs less in a day and he still has to run the same amount
is it going to take him 15 days to run 105 miles
okay because we are just kind of getting to this and we are realizing that we can use some of our division strategies but we have to use other things i want to give you one more problem before we go off to work
me 16.8 divided by 12
me i want you to think about these as whole numbers and think about what you know about division and decimals did you want to change something
i wanted to take out the decimal because it could be like whole numbers and at the end up the decimal back before we jump ahead i want you to compare these problems for a 2nd this one to this one to the one we started with what is the difference between these 3 division problems that you notice i will put a star next to the ones we are looking at
this this and this what is different about them so one of them i gave you options that is true but what is different about the actual problem the equation
there is multi ways to find it agreed i am going to write this in the same form as the others i am going to see if you notice something between this this and this
is the decimal number is the dividend divisor keep that in mind for a 2nd notice that the divisors in these have the decimal numbers here it is the dividend keep that in mind
one more than 10 time i am giving you 3 possibilities what is the answer to 16.8 divided by 12 and why
i want my ones to tell my 2s what they think is a reasonable answer and why eye to eye
what do you think
tell why you think it is one.4 m think about why you think it is one.4
answer you can not just choose them why do you choose them my ones told my 2s what they think the answer was
tell me what told you and why
one.4 because i said 12 you take away the decimal between the 4 and the one and 12 times 14 is 116 you are saying that if i take away the decimal and say that this is no if you take away the decimal for one.4
okay you can do 12 times 14 it is equal to 116
so you are using groups of the divisor but thinking about our rules of multiplying decimals and if this was one.4 this answer would have to be are these the reverse of each other a someone else tell me why their partner thought the answer might be one.4
tell me why said that
now 16 and tenths is it somewhere between these 2 numbers or is it less between so you are saying the answer has to be somewhere between one and 2
think i think it is one.4
why because 16.8 go ahead 16.8 has a decimal and one.4 has a decimal does that always work with them was was it 150 yes so this had a decimal but the answer did not the quotient did not so
i noticed if you just look at the whole number 6 divided by 12 16 you mean 16 divided by 12 is only you and i great minds think alike
12 i had 16 pieces of candy and shared them with 12 of you 11 piece plus part of another do we think the answer is one.4 14 or 140 14 why
because you said one.4 when you were talking to i changed my answer why because why do you think the answer is 14 and not one.4 never mind i got mixed up
one.4 do you understand why it is one.4 comment we are showing that we are listening to her i noticed a rule
is the decimal is in the divisor when the decimal is in the divisor yeah then the quotient will have a 0
mean the quotient may be larger and when the decimal is in the you think the quotient is smaller i want you to see if that rule is true as you work on these problems you are developing what you think is a rule for working with these decimals i want you to think about that as you work
a i agree with said 14 and the reason why is 168 divided by 12 is 14 is convinced that 168 divided by 12 is 14
true that is true as whole numbers ask yourself is it reasonable to think that if i added a decimal that i am going to have the same quotient is that reasonable
3 now add a decimal did i get the same quotient no say 12 times one is 12 and 12 times 4 is so you are breaking apart the dividend which works
in addition to what said the dividend has a decimal because it is sharing with more people but if it is the divisor there will be less that is a great idea
that when the dividend has a decimal it is sharing between more people but when the divisor has a decimal it is sharing to less people that is right we think a context for it
yes in addition to what said when he said 168 divided by 12 equals 14 16.8 became 10 times larger 16.8 became 10 times larger from here
168 10 times smaller what are you saying that the quotient also 16.8 got 10 times larger when it changed to 168
sorry okay what happens to my quotient it gets 10 times smaller if my dividend got 10 times larger what happens to my quotient it gets smaller one.4 divided by 10 is 14
it got 10 times larger do you agree with that you do it 1st of all you have division strategies that you feel confident using use them but think about the reasonableness of your answer is my estimate and is my quotient reasonable if i place this in a story context
as you work on page c 85 i want you to use the division strategies you already know and then you are going to be asked to think about tips if you had to give a 4th grader some tips for dividing decimals next year what would they be rules at the end we will share problem number 7
you may want to circle number 7 and we will also share your tips please i will come right to you 12nd please a few of you said i am going to work with you so why do not you go back to the table do you have a question
i was going to say it is too hard to explain does it make sense that the answer is one.4 no i am still you are still confused why do not you come to this back table and i will work with you and we can talk a little bit about these problems i do not know how to write this problem sure you do
context think about what you know about dividing whole numbers and how you may have to change that slightly okay okay do you want to work on some of your division strategies now
yes when you do division and make it into a whole number you need to make it 10 times bigger or smaller what do you think do think about what you are doing when you make it into a whole number
is the number becoming is the dividend or the divisor becoming 10 times larger or smaller and what would you need to be your quotient okay is this allergies or being upset
know you ready to start or do you need help help i want you guys to start please
numbers remember what i just said to and what i said to 2 or 3 other people if the quotient to 121 divided by 11 is 11 do you think the quotient to this is going to be 11 too yes i can not figure it out
come to the back and i will help you out do your best thinking until i get to you thinking hard i just put the decimal right there so i do not get you are dividing them like whole numbers running do i think my answer is going to be 11 or do you think the quotient will be larger
how do i get it exactly what do you think think about the context we did at the beginning with the number line do not think about the exact answer think about whether your answer is reasonable or not
yes honey what is the matter come here please what is going on
help a few people said yesterday that they still don t feel comfortable dividing whole numbers and that is who i am meeting with right so just tell me that you do not get it okay too would you like to have lunch with me today okay we are going to meet during lunch because i have noticed you have been really upset the last few days okay i do not know what is going on i have tried asking a few times but we will sit and have lunch together how does that sound
good so go wipe your face in the bathroom with some water come in come to the back table and i will help you out okay go ahead gentlemen are we still stuck on number one or have we moved forward 2 it looks like you have got an idea of what is going on
let us look at number one for a 2nd what is the 1st step we can do did we say what on number one i just took off the one one so you took away the decimal and imagined it was 11 okay so what is 121 divided by 11
use did you use groups of the divisor breaking apart the dividend use i just used a standard algorithm which is strategy b which is where you put your name anyway right
so when you used the standard algorithm what did you get 2nd if the quotient to this problem is 11 is the quotient to a totally different problem also 11
10 is it reasonable to think it is 11 that so you are saying these 2 numbers are what what 10 times larger
so what do you think might happen to the quotient if this got 10 times larger 110 let us think about this in a context
11 now he is going to run one.10 of a mile a day so will it take him more days or less days more by how many right 10 times larger
so the answer that seems reasonable there is 110 right does that make sense does that make sense of let us do our work for number one then move to the next one and it will start to make sense as we go along we just got done with number one
11 who can tell why the answer cannot be 11 it cannot be 11 because there is a decimal right there and you have to times it by 10 and it is going to be 110
11 the quotient is 11 when i divide them as if they are whole numbers but when i multiply decimals like the whole numbers did the product of that answer look the same as the one for the decimal they looked different so do you think this one needs to look different as well this quotient needs to look different
absolutely so we were just talking about number one how if i do it as a whole number the divisor becomes 10 times larger so my quotient needs to become 10 times larger who can give me the problem for the next one
read the number as it is problem let us turn it into whole numbers go 35 divided by 7 strategy how are you doing
good breaking apart the dividend people we know 35 divided by 7 is 5
5 my other 2 options are what 50 why because it has to get 10 times larger okay so you are saying that you want to make the answer 10 times larger
50 because from this number 5 5 8 because there are not options think about what you did above and think about how that might help you for 5 8
be i am going to give you some options for 5 then think about how you can apply that to 67 and 8 so 45.6 divided by 3 one.52 how do i read this number 50.4 or do you think it is this
i am giving you kind of a lead here with 5 larger because it was 0.7 but it is 0.07
500 why is this 500 instead of 50 no now you know because it is in the hundredths place so it is supposed to be timesed by 100 so when it is whole numbers it is 5 and since this is 2 places i need to move the decimal 2 places
that is a really good observation i like that
realize i realized for 35 divided by 7 it is a whole number so we have to make it 100 times smaller not 100 times smaller but 100 times larger boys and girls
7 hundredths imagine that on our hundredths grid if i had 100 7 times i would end up with 7 full grids quotient i needs to become 100 times larger
multiplication is kind of like division they are somewhat related right we can not go by the same exact rules but somewhat sense i want you to try the next one start on the next one and then i will come back and see if i can support you if need be
t i know the answers but i am stuck on number 5 is this equation true that 121 divided by 11 is 110 you are either working or going back to your seat i have to write another equation exactly
remember how when we were dividing and people used groups of the divisor this you have to go back and rewrite it with the decimal in this case sense you have the work here that i had up here
problem running short on time you do not get how you do this problem
notice when i turn this into the original problem what happens to the dividend it gets smaller how much smaller 10 times why do not you go back next to and ask him for support if need be
head back to please it gets 10 times smaller so what do you think is going to happen to that what do you think the answer is going to be right and also think about this if this was 7 divided by 9 9 divided by 9 would be equal to what one if it is less than 9 is my answer going to be greater than one
no so think about is it reasonable within its context doing do you have a question no help i know you do but now you need to show me you can do it when you do not have options okay think about what you did in these problems
even though they presented you with 3 options for answers you still had to think about which option is actually accurate
strategy can i get my eraser back you do have an eraser right here right borrow is right sense it is kind of hard have we chosen an answer yet
already i want you to wrap up the problem you are currently working on and in your head i am going to ask you to think about what is it you are noticing you can do in order to divide numbers with decimals it seems like we are not totally ready to share or ready for tips
what are you doing or noticing in terms of a pattern or rule when i divide decimals let us quickly go over this problem before we head down to lunch what did we say the 1st step was turn it into a whole number that what is the problem when it is a whole number
9 remember we always say the number inside of the brackets 1st 72 divided by 9 remember the outside number is the divisor and the inside is the dividend
9 we have been working on these facts think about a fact you know 8 do you guys agree problem you did 8 times 10
10 why did you do 8 times 10 the 2 in 7 and 2 tenths is in the tenths place so i just did this is in the tenths place so you want to do 8 times 10 to get 80
think i disagree with answer you just have to add a decimal you think 8 is the answer but you just have to add a decimal yeah why do you think i have to just add a decimal because there is nothing else you can do
think i do not really get it what do you think 80 why because what did you notice happens to this number
it is 10 times smaller so what needs to happen to my quotient if this got 10 times smaller let us think about this for a 2nd
look at the original problem what do i know that is near this problem that helps me rationalize this answer as to why it is 8 tenths 80 7.2 is near 80 no this is near what 7.2 is near what 7
9 less than what less than one one i have 7 pieces of candy no so 7 divided by 9 has to be less than one so if i have 7.2 divided by 9 can my answer be 80
one it is a little confusing but it helps to think about a context for this answer ladies and gentlemen before we head downstairs i want you to turn and tell your partner what are you noticing as a tip you may add later on when we finish this up after lunch or tomorrow at the start of our lesson what are you noticing about dividing with decimals turn and tell your partner
shared what is one tip from this problem you can ignore the decimal and divide so if one answer is 10 times larger you are going to make the quotient 10 times smaller let us see if that is true ladies and gentlemen stop where you are
i am seeing some tips i am wondering if we will agree or disagree with tomorrow tomorrow some of them may indeed work
i am going to ask you to put that sheet of paper at the center of the desk and i appreciate you taking your hat off during hat day for our video because obviously that would not have been very professional of us but you did have your mathematical hat on which was good and i know this was challenging but we will continue to work with this and you will understand it
like i said in our morning message you are going to master this okay you are welcome to get your hat and put it back on for school hat day class we will head right down to lunch
if you are factor of 25 you may you are a factor of 5 up if you are a we are transitioning quickly and silently
j can somebody read what we are going to be doing today in our math lesson you have to read loudly please
we will learn how to add fractions with unlike denominators we will discuss strategies for subtraction fractions plus take notes about our discoveries so which part of this did we do yesterday
fractions can anyone learn anything specific or anything that they learned yesterday about adding fractions
remember speak up please what we did was we the 1st thing we did was we did 14th plus you added up the 14th and the 2 fourths
you said the problem was something like one and 14th and 2 and 3 fourths yes is that right okay does anyone remember what we did with this one yes we added one +2 2 because they are the 2 wholes and that gave us 3
and then how do you know that 14th +3 fourths equals a whole
because they have the same denominator are the same so if this equals 4 fourths if the top and bottom numerator and denominator are the same they equal one whole yes okay
like you do 4 squares is that what you mean okay then you scribble in one square why one square
in then the other one you do 3 fourths 3 of them because the numerator tells us to if you take the one from the 4th and put it on the 3 fourths that is one whole anybody have anything else to say about that
s then we like if a number is the same keep it the same which number like if we had 14th +2 fourths you are supposed to keep the fourths the same do you remember what that part of the fraction is called
i heard you say 14th +2 fourths and you say it is the 4 that is the same called the numerator which one is the denominator the 4 excellent what does anybody remember sit
c so if the bottom was the same if i said eyes over here please 3 eighths +3 fourths what would i have to do resource i see the same 3 people
ideas no one remembers what to do if the denominator is not the same number do you are supposed to add the numbers 4 times what do you mean 4 times
0 you said you add it 4 times and then you said 4 8 12 16 j to find the common multiple
right so for 4s we did skip counting by one 2 3 4 put a little line so we can keep that separated no what else do i need to do why because someone with their hand raised so i know who i am looking at
you have got to so i have 4 here again 3 fourths the denominator is 4 right
too because the 8 is the denominator and you have to skip count by that too here if i skip count one time what would this be 24 i know a few of you can tell me your eighths then what 32
16 i see 16 and i see 8 biggest the smallest the least so we are going to try to find the least common multiple or the smallest number they have in common 8 here i am multiplying my 8 by one so do i have to do anything no because it is just going to give me the same answer so i can just do that
what about 3 fourths what do i multiply 4 by to get to 8 notes what do i have to do to 3 fourths multiply the top just the top
why why remember say you have to multiply the top and bottom by a whole
and what kind of whole does it do i put a big one whole if you times it by how many there are what do you mean how many there are i mean what did we figure out here again
that 4 times 2 equals 8 which is the same thing as 3 times 8 3 times 8 or 3 eighths 3 eighths okay 2 so you are saying i need to do 3 times 2 and 4 times 2
whole that whole tell me about that whole it has the same numbers and good resource in the room the number line
it is at 100% it is equivalent as 5 fifths 3 thirds and 10 tenths because you remember that one whole means the top and the bottom are the same the numerator and denominator are the same we know that you need 2 pieces to make a whole and we have 2 pieces right making 2 twelfths what is 3 times 2
6 and what is 4 times 2 8 so now my new equation is 3 eighths +6 eighths which gives me what 9 eighths am i done
no it is improper it is improper so we need to change it to a what is a mixed number again what do i need to do you need to times what do i need to times
3 eighths and 6 eighths why do i need to times them because that is how you make it a okay that is all right l some of you are looking at your notes and not using them all
so i take 9 -8 like that though the 8 is like the denominator so you would not get the whole from the number but if i write 8 that is just an 8 right whole yeah why am i taking a whole out
because 8 and 9 one what am i left with 18th where can i put my 18th
go you color in one whole whenever we did the arrays remember how i drew it if i am adding them together 3 how many do i color in here
6 how many do i color in here we did 3 eighths how many do i color in here here remember the numerator tells us to color in sixths one 2 3 4 5 6 whole what can i do
whole what can i do with these pieces over here okay how about somebody in the front row
j you take 2 of the pieces from 3 eighths and put it in 6 eighths right
this is leftover this one is leftover so i can take this guy and put it it is kind of an additional right does this show one whole and this extra little 8th over here
after we have gone over reminding ourselves how to add the fractions especially ones with unlike denominators we can switch to seeing what we can do with subtracting in your math notebooks i want you to turn to a fresh new page i want you to put subtracting fractions at the bottom or at the top
you are also going to need to make your columns do it right over here 3 put what do we always put on our notes on the top left corner
unit this is the 3rd major thing we have gone over 3rd major thing
up if you have the date at the top of your paper give me a thumbs up up if you have the topic subtracting fractions at the top of your paper thumbs up
if i were sitting on my notes it would go here in the 1st column all right
answer knowing what you know about adding fractions i am going to put a subtraction problem up here and see if you can figure out a strategy that will work to help you solve this subtraction problem and then i am going to have people come up and share okay
easy here is your 1st problem it you can solve it here or here lied solve it in the last column because that is where we solve
down worry about spelling later on right now i want you to worry about getting your thoughts on to paper okay it do you have your problem written down here
helpful is that better yeah so try something try something
this is more about experimenting and trying more than do you have the answer right on the 1st try all right remember be brave
okay what did you come up with can i go to the bathroom yeah i don t know
adding what are you showing here problem so how do you do that
it what what did you subtract 2 -one equals one 3 i am not saying you are wrong
did not because i saw a denominator and plus i subtracted the denominator okay if you can get this drawn out i would like you to come up and show it
that what do you put there
okay would anyone like to come up and show what they came up with for an answer and i can move my stuff out of the way and move this and turn it back
up remember to speak up a little bit so we can hear you want what did you do up here mister
okay so you drew another square and subtracted one excellent let us give a hand because i know that was hard for him you would anyone else like to come up and share their work
s thank you to my students that are being great listeners and turning their bodies so they are facing the speaker why do not you turn off that 1st light and see if that helps
seat would you like to come up and share what you did we are going to do one more and then maybe move on to something tougher a bit more complicated
do the denominator stays the same and then 2 -one equals one so i got 13rd i am hearing that something is similar among all the people that are showing their work what is something that is similar besides the answer is 13rd
a they said 2 -one equals one numerator said that the 2 in the numerator 2 thirds and the one in the numerator 13rd 2 -one equals one on nothing okay what else is similar
that the denominator stays the same
s because if a number is the same how about this let me rephrase my question if i said 2 thirds -14th am i comparing the same kinds of pieces
why someone with their hand raised so i know who i am listening to would you explain really quick because it is equal are thirds and fourths equal saying okay
saying you stay put sir can somebody else continue explaining what started there
okay so i said if had 2 thirds -14th the thirds and fourths are they the same types of pieces no so if i am subtracting 13rd from 2 thirds are the thirds the same types of pieces yes or no yes so the denominators have to be the same because i am comparing the same sized pieces yes if they are not the same then am i comparing the same sized pieces
no we are going to do hopefully 2 to 3 more problems so if you did not get to share this time hopefully you will get to share next time that yes madam yes
try same thing as before if you can explain it and then solve it in your 3 columns here is your new problem
that yes one whole and 14th take away 3 fourths what are you going to do with that so try something we did 2 thirds -13rd so you know that you are taking pieces away
down i will give you your pencil in a 2nd assuming there are not going to be anymore problems between the 2 of you
sure so that means when i give you your pencil back you are going to be solving the equation as best you can and not goofing off anymore correct it got it written down
what can i do this 11 think about it
if the problem were this 13 take away 9 would you be able to take 9 away from 3 do i have to borrow how would that look here can i do this and this what would that look like
to 14th so you are saying one whole is equal to 14th like that if i were to draw it like this one 2 3 4 is the same as that
here colored all of it many one whole what does one whole equal then 4 there you go you okay
person sometimes just hearing the words does not make sense to me sometimes i need to see what you are trying to explain if you are having a hard time putting it into words see if you can put it into pictures and that might help you to explain it okay you how is it going over here i need help this way works much better where are you stuck
why do not you say 14th -3 fourths why shade in the whole thing because when i was going to do the answer i put it back over there how many of you think that you have an answer the works
how many of you are stuck in a horrible hole and you just can not get out of it how many of you are wanting to exchange some ideas with your neighbor to see if you can get an idea from a neighbor it here is what i am going to do and here is what i am going to ask
chair you may turn to the people next to you behind you or in front of you
i want you to turn to your neighbors and share with them what you have tried and see if they have ideas okay
work i am saying share the work explain to each other what you have tried you have an answer
ideas what did you come up with nothing nothing okay so one whole if the denominator is fourths what would this look like i do not see it broken up into many pieces what would a whole look like if we are talking about fourths
can you show me what it would look like in that circle this one here broke it up into 4 pieces you have 4 pieces colored in here plus this piece here and you are taking away this right
part all you are doing is showing me an extra section away i am taking it away and moving right blocking it out away okay
what one whole this one here from is this part of this or is this part of this
left interesting with so after talking you are stuck in a hole it all i heard was blah blah blah not for another 10 minutes
sorry okay ideas some of you are totally stuck in your hole so let us see what we can come up with for people that should get themselves out of the hole that they got stuck in
does someone think that they understand enough to try to share their work with the rest of the class with remember there are 22 of you and only so much time in the day so i cannot have every single person come up s what i did was you can sit down in the chair if you would like
what i did was i put one whole and 14th hold on 12nd i am going to make it a bit bigger there you go what i did was i did one whole and 14th and then this is the 4th i took away the other one whole can you show me the taking away of 3 fourths that you did
ms b this is one whole right this is 14th and that is the one and 14th part of the equation correct is this this yes so this is one whole and 14th right
that yes does this make sense with this no what is going to be considered a whole if i am talking about fourths what does this what is equivalent to one whole if i am talking about fourths
4 fourths so what we are really saying here is this one and 14th is 4 fourths plus this extra 4th right no so this is one whole correct
yes this is 14th right yes so all of this is this correct
yes except that has shown us thank you that this whole is actually one square cut into 4 pieces and all the pieces are colored in right so this one whole remember talking about cakes
it is still a whole cake in the pan and in this case i sliced it into 4 pieces now can people see that this whole is actually 4 pieces
continue hold on a 2nd board i want you ready to listen like a great listener would thank you
you have to take away 3 fourths and your fourths are right here okay this is i took away 3 okay so you put the hold on understand so you put these in here or are you showing you took them out
i am showing so you took them out them yes okay then it equaled 14th so this you are saying has one piece leftover yes okay so this one has 14th in it still
yes 14th less than one +one equals 2
clearly if i look over here at this what you did was you took the 3 fourths from our equation and subtracted it from here
right yes so if i take 4 fourths and subtract 3 fourths class what is leftover if i have 4 fourths and i subtract 3 fourths 4 -3 that would be 14th if i put it with this 4th what have i got
okay would someone else like to explain it in a different way her would you like to come up and show what you did i need your focus again
did i drew a box a little bit louder please thank you i drew a box can you show exactly where you did that right here that is your clock and you shaded in the whole thing to show the whole
that what is that top circle so that top circle is that whole you cut into fourths and then you eliminate which excellent vocabulary by the way 3 of them
again because you are supposed to take away 3 fourths can you take away the 3 fourths with the sharpie since it is darker left then i have my 2nd spot and shaded it in
i cut it into fourths and shaded in one for this 14th i saw that i had them up this is one leftover this was 2 and this okay thank you actually here is what we are going to do
i am going to ask you guys to try one more
now you have seen people doing the pictures of them so what we have basically seen is if we take this whole and show it as a whole so the whole here is fourths this is my whole colored in plus the extra 4th here and then i start taking away what is leftover one 2 3 i can add what is left and get my answer
okay so what i want you to do in your notebook well here let us look at what we have left in our picture
yes i showed that one whole is 4 fourths i subtracted 3 fourths one is gone fourths this is broken into fourths so subtract one 2 3
one how much is in this down here one this is what is leftover from the whole what one and 14th -3 fourths equals 2 fourths that is okay
here is what i want you to do in your math workbook i am going to give you 3 problems that i want you to start working on now but will be homework if you do not finish them right so on a new page these are the problems i want you to solve
starts anything that is not finished is going to be considered homework do we understand yes so right now the expectation is that you are copying these into your math notebook so you can start working on them i would like for you to try working on them by yourself please thank you
okay today we re going to be working we ll continue our work in bits and pieces
yesterday we looked at equivalent fractions and how many ways we can remember how to a fraction but this morning we re going to be comparing fractions to benchmarks and by benchmarks i mean reference points and benchmarks could be 0 half one
that s a good when you re looking at any fraction when you compare fractions when you look at fractions you re thinking okay why does this fractions belong the smaller of so your reference points or your benchmark your best benchmark or reference points should be 0 half and one
a number line is a wonderful way or strategies for comparing fractions
so if you want to compare if i want to place to fit in a number line where the fractions belongs it is a smaller fraction or bigger fraction my best bet is to look at the number line have my 0 my half
ground i always told you that no matter what the number is find your middle ground i ll find my half then my whole the next is how far is to fit from one half
it s closer to one half and equals up to 0 is to fit closer to one or to fit closer to half if you know this fraction you re going to know this so question if you know what 25th is where should i place it

tell us why you think 2 fifths is placed the 2 fifths is right yes explain why that should be 25th
i think 25th should be right there because if you make 5 times over here if you make 5 times on this line it would be closer to 0 because it s only 22 parts of 5 and if it was one part it would be closer to 0 because it s not fully at 3 or closer to one or one half
or you just divided from here to here 5 from here to here so from 0 or from the 5th but where are we
who agrees or disagrees with j because 3 fifths is not equal to one half 3 fifths is actually 60% and the okay why would s half be
it would just be a half because what is the half you can give it to me decimally what do you mean .5 that s a half it s .5 half of one but she said divided into fifths
okay so what would this half be do you want to correct yourself okay what would this half be
2 fifths .52.5 would that be yes it okay speak up
i didn t hear what you said okay what should the 15th be come here so besides the 15th every other thing every fraction on the number line is correct no let s give you a different line right here by yours
what could she have called that
yes does that represent one half yes okay next question we are all in agreement that this is the right one
okay having done this which benchmark is 25th closest to which benchmark is 2 fifths closest to remember i said to you the benchmark could be 0 it could be one half it could be whole so here which benchmark
how on the number line you see one half and did is 2.5 over 5 okay can somebody add to that yes
so you re saying i could convert this to 40% okay go ahead what 40% is closer and this is 50% you say 40% is closer to 50% than what
this is a benchmarks so you re choosing to go half right and 40% is closer to half than 01 is 40% closer to one how much is this one
okay so 40% is closer to 50% than to 100% or 0% is that what you re all saying
say it s like up and down okay i m glad she brought that up here fractions or rational numbers right
so if you re rounding it up in this case you re looking at the benchmarks and you re thinking to yourself which of these benchmark is my fraction closest to so how do you say that what you are going to be doing today is compare fractions to benchmark
we re going to play a little game before i give you we go to activities our goal today is to use benchmarks to estimate the size of fractions and compare fractions if you look over here again what did is compare this to fifths to percent
so that you re trying to estimate how close am i have and if i know this i know that this is my this is what i need to go i m going to go with this from point a to point b because point b is closest to point a
so we use benchmarks and benchmarks are what you are going to be using your best benchmark is 0 half and one plus you want to say to yourself this is where i want to start
if i divide my number line into 2 if i divide it into my number line 0 is my starting point journey and here is my journey where i m going
so your 0 point your half and your one is your benchmark and benchmark is reference point
so when you play that game you re going to ask yourself okay which of these benchmarks is my fraction closest to we ll do that right now and move to the next activity so i give you where you think it belongs
okay let s start the activity i m going to start with your fraction where it belongs down no no no no
time you don t have one that s moving moving you re thinking about it as soon as i gave it to you
okay okay
yes what is 110th 10th what is that that s 10% and 13rd is between 0 and one half who is 13rd how much is that how much
okay who has 8 tenths 80% whose is that okay tenths 90% okay
6 tenths 60% 4 tenths 4 sixths who is that give it to me in percent 66 and 2 thirds or another fraction name you did we do 5 sixths no
who s 5 sixths you ve got time how can we i like what s going on how can we use what we know here
based on what we have say that again a half we can go to a half and half would be what half would be what half would be what in fraction 3 sixths okay
and you said half is how much in percent okay so how much you have left 56 left which is what
fraction we want to remember to twelfths okay now what is the name that fraction could have used to make it a lot easier for you 13rd okay
okay thank you i didn t mean to do that but it was interesting that you had that who has 6 fifths 120% 120% are you sure yes how is that well i know that let me see if we can break it down a little bit more
anybody okay so i was percent because it s okay thank you who am i leaving out
118s 137.5% ooh 11 eighths right 11 eighths you said it s 1137 and one half percent 137 and one half percent can you break it down for us
you is that everybody speak up please can you break it down
okay i know that 11 is an improper fraction i like that i want to go there fraction and i took one whole out of 11
10 how much is that 20% and it was i added 110th to a 100% which 100 10% okay thank you
group improper fractions because the numerator is bigger than the denominator okay so we have improper fractions because the numerator is greater than the denominator which means what when the numerator is bigger than the denominator what does that mean me it s it s a more than whole number
okay so we re now going to work through do our last activity which is going to in your book we re going to go to page 24
we re going to go to page 24 and we re going to solve questions a to d and we re going to come back so i would like you to work in groups
so let s see if we go 3 by 3 then there will be 2
fine so let s see 123123123123 stay and work at the tables i don t want more than one group how many groups do we have come on let s go guys
3 groups around the table what i mean is one group over there one group over there one group over there so you 2 are together so you guys are left
and now come back who s your partner you 3 come back i know that some of you usually work ahead of me
if you re one of those already ahead of me i m going to ask you to go with your group i want to hear the talking that is going on go to page 24 go page 24
so there were some other things i want to listen in on
time yeah so if you 2 are discussing this time here to work on his own
here okay which one and which one this one was between 0 and one and you changed the fractions and you rearranged them
no so what you have for what that s a okay you re still working on it
maybe as soon as you can keep track for today that s what i mean
why don t we move this and have this the way you re doing this is very confusing to me
you re going to you can go to the next page
how does it look
that s what i asked you
are you doing the same for both okay go to the next one then
it how are we doing over here are you still on a why you you don t know what you need to do
you re looking at those fractions and putting them exactly where they belong so you cannot be putting checks like that line them up just the way i did the line that i showed you like what we just did so let s go ahead and put them in there okay keep going
are you finished go back and start discussing i m not sure you re keeping track on how you re solving them your strategy
him if you ask him and he tells you you have your benchmark right which is okay okay so you ask yourself what is half of 9 half of 9 is
a 4.5 okay why don t you do that right here and you know that is how much okay so you ask yourself you re looking at 7 ninths so is 7 ninths closer to one or is 7 ninths closer to one half or closer to 0
reason so if you say it s closer to one why would it be closer to one because it to more steps to go to 12 more fractions to go to one okay so how much do you think each of them will be valued was telling you what to do
129 and multiply it by one okay this is a group thing
what the numerator okay you multiply the number of what number of pieces the number times the denominator so what is it the units so what is it called the units you know how you say you divide in by 9 right and 9 is what
what does that stand for in the fraction 7 ninths what is 99 is the denominator and that denominator stands for what the number of pieces that make a whole okay so 9 ninths is 100% right yeah so you divide into one whole like you said you divide by 9 and you said times
times the numerator times the number of pieces which is 7 okay how are we doing okay cause i m going to you ll soon be on your question d yeah okay
guys pretty good so why don t you we did 24 but so that s what we did way and this last part you guys a
you did around it would be nice for you to put those fractions in the column where they belong
did but somebody else may not understand what you re doing okay
and times for with the fractions we explained what each of them have which is
b so like for the 1st one i used we used that to help us with the 1st one like you said like you said because the numerator is bigger than the denominator the denominator is the same so we don t compare that
say it again when you have the same denominator what do you do
so instead of trying to figure it out we replaced it so it would be easier for us so like the denominator and you know sometimes when you tell us we may actually make it the same denominator that s what we did with this question
so question 3 yeah denominators i didn t really so we did one
okay so the common denominators were and 7 ninths is 63
so 7 times 9 is 63 and 3 times 21 is 63 2121 times 2 is 42
63 divided by 9 is 7 and 7 times 7 is 49
so that means that the 3 sevenths is 27 and 7 ninths is 49 i m going to ask you what goes into b
okay you guys all set with b b you guys all set with b yes okay how about you guys yes
okay and you go to c
d wait a minute is anybody going to do b d just one
d are you guys ready for a okay let s go fast are you ready for b
over there go over there and write it down fast
so 2 to 21 is and the other one is in the other one
okay who does not have a marker done let s do it
marker did i give you guys 2 markers no we don t have time you re doing problem c 1st to go
how could i give you okay which one are you going to do okay we don t have time
okay great finished a is all set
set give them that marker give them that marker in your hand
okay you guys all set
so you did this is we can continue that discussion later we re going to do presentation
anybody else okay what okay you know what let s add up one
okay are you finished yes okay
okay sit up please get sit up please you re a or you re c
presentations okay please get seated anyone from group a to come over and tell us what you did
please you can read the problem out because we want to know what the problem says comparing fractions to benchmarks a decided whether each fraction below is in the interval between 0 and one half the interval between one half and one or the between one and one half record your information in the which shows which fractions are in each interval
what we wrote for a benchmark on question a was we found all the fractions that in order between 0.5 and one half and one and one and one half 15th 3 twelfths 38s and 17th are al between 0 and one half
and 6 tenths 7 tenths 34s are all between one half and one are all between one and one half do you all agree yes thank you b let s go who s doing the presentation read your question decide whether each fraction is closer to 01 half one or one and one half
3 eighths is closer to one half 7 twelfths 17 over 12 is closer to one and one half 7 eighths is closer to one and 7 ninths is closer to one is there any one that you guys think is in the wrong spot
yes i thought that 7 tenths was closer to the one yeah closer to the one
c number one is 5 eighths is less than 6 eighths i know that because they have the same denominator so i checked if the numerators which one is bigger and 6 eighths is bigger than 5 eighths is he right
i knew that cause if you convert 3 ninths it will be to 13rd and 23rd is greater than 13rd and for number 4 the 13 twelfths is less than 6 fifths i know that because is less than 6 fifths 13 twelfths yes
and number 516 twelfths 6 twelfths is less than 5 ninths i know that because 5 is greater than one half and 6 twelfths is one half
and number 6 is 3 fourths is equal to 12 sixths because if you because 12 16 ths equals 3 fourths and the other one s 3 fourths too
you let s go to d
60 divided by 12 is 3 is 5 and 5 times 4 is 2060 divided by 10 is 6 and 6 times 7 is 4260 divided by 6 is 10 and 10 times 5 is 50
so after we did that we from least to greatest which is 112th 7 tenths 4 fifths and 5 sixths and from least to greatest that was for that problem and for this problem we found a common denominator again and the common denominator was 63 cause 39 and 7 can go into 63
so 63 divided by 3 is 21 and 11 times 2 is 2263 divided by 9 is 7 and 7 times 7 is 4963 divided by 7 is 9 and 9 times 3 is 27
so after we did that we put them in order from least to greatest which is 3 sevenths was the 1st 2 thirds was the 2nd and 7 ninths was the last are there any questions no right how did you get the 63 okay so how we got the 63 was we found a common denominator and for what for all 3 fractions 63 divided by 3 will be 21
63 divided by 9 will be 7 and 63 divided by 7 will be 9 so after we did that we knew it was the common denominator so we used that to help us divide fractions and find the least to greatest what do you mean by common denominator common denominator is a number that all the denominators share in common you have a question are we all set
you okay we ve come to the end of this activity let s go back and see if we actually met our goal were we able to use benchmarks to compare fractions
yes did we develop strategies for comparing other fractions yes what strategy did we develop the common denominator what other strategies least to greatest that s okay that s what other strategies did you percentage we used percentage what other strategies did you use
use was telling me he 2 denominators that are the same and looked at the numerator strategy so when you go back you check all the strategies we said we can use in comparing fractions it s also converting a fraction converting a fraction into another fraction or naming the fractions
all these things helps us you know compare fractions to things well thank you you guys are wonderful
so what we re going to do is on our blank sheet of paper we re going to make a graphic organizer to kind of help us organize these shapes
okay so hopefully on your paper you have done something like that you so the shape the picture and the question marks and you want to make sure you have enough room for this so hopefully you re using your whole paper to help you
it s up to you whatever is going to help you and i m going to be doing it on the board with you so hopefully you ll have something to look at okay so i m going to show you the name and the picture of a plain figure but i m also going to show you what it s not i m going to show you what it actually is and then i m going to show you what is not that shape
2nd and then these are examples of them and based on those examples that you re given pay attention based on those examples you are given i want you to come up with your own definition group it s up to you but you re going to come up with your own definition and i m only going to give you about 30 seconds or a minute to come up with your own definition based on what you see on the board
okay all right are you guys ready to go go the 1st shape is a square square okay so under shape what are we going to write square square then we re going to what draw a multiple students picture picture then with your group you have about a minute to 30 seconds
write a definition under the question mark not under the actual definition under the question mark is what is the definition it s up to you yeah what are you writing a 4 sided shape under the question mark good under the question mark yes
all sides equal is a parallelogram okay good so we have pictures of squares right here and then we have pictures that are not squares right so based on what you see what is a square how would you describe a square in your own words under a question mark
what is a square based on what you see and based on what you know that looks just like scribble yeah it kind of does look like scribble so obviously that s not a what square that s not a square that s not even a shape no it s not
so real quick give me some answers okay it is something that has all equal sides so i m just going to write equal sides
okay good a shape that has all equal sides l it can be used for okay shape it has 4 edges 4 what edges 4 edges okay so 4 edges all right good okay so the shape has 4 corners
c it s a parallelogram a parallelogram okay what else
i put it is a 4 sided shape with but yeah it is a 4 sided shape okay a 4 sided shape so we could just put 4 equal sides there okay m a parallelogram with 2 pairs of parallel sides okay a parallelogram with 2 pairs of parallel sides
perfect so 2 pairs of parallel sides good and i ll take one more next an equal sided figure and equal sided figure good so here is the technical definition of a square you ready for it
close a parallelogram with 4 congruent sides and 4 right angles angles book so a parallelogram and we had most of that so that was good now what does congruent mean because we didn t use that word congruent when we described it based on what we knew and what we saw mean why don t you take a guess
think if it has 4 congruent sides 4 congruent sides based on what we know about a square
means a square has 4 congruent sides what what do you think 4 congruent sides do you want to call on a friend to help you
m equal sides equal sides good so if you didn t know what that word congruent means you need to add that to your vocabulary and i would even write in your notebook what equal so i can remember congruent means what
equal and if you just knew what a square was and you knew that it had 4 equal sides then that should be a pretty easy thing to remember all right we did that one slowly and we did it with a shape we re familiar with so that we can understand what we need to do writing all right so are we ready
one rectangle so these are rectangles and these are what not rectangles not rectangles so real quick i want you to draw it and write how you would define it
it maybe we can use that new vocabulary word we just learned which was what congruent congruent let s use that new vocabulary word we just learned congruent how would you describe a rectangle how would you define it in your own words
no yes it is because it has i want you to save all your energy for when you talk shhh we ll talk about it
on put your hands down because i haven t asked anybody it is so you re saying that a rectangle is always larger than a square
is always no not always so can that be a definition that we can use for a rectangle if it s not true all the time say you said a parallelogram with 2 pairs of congruent sides
very good i like that does it have any congruent sides so you re saying that none of the sides are congruent yes
yes which sides are congruent so you re saying to me that this side and this side are congruent they re equal no
so what is congruent about a rectangle think about that okay okay
share i m going to take one person from each table just for time because we ve got to get into groups in a few minutes s it has a right angle in it it has a what a right angle it has a right angle so you re saying one right angle
okay so is saying a rectangle is only a shape with a right with 4 right angles all right so 4 angles so a rectangle is a shape with 4 right angles sides 4 corners 4 corners 4 edges
4 edges okay so a rectangle has 4 corners 4 sides and 4 edges word who used the vocabulary in their definition a a parallelogram with 2 pairs of congruent sides a parallelogram so a parallelogram with what 2 congruent sides with 2 pairs
pairs where are the 2 pairs on the sides where are the 2 pairs of congruent sides e on each side like the top and bottom so the top and bottom are congruent and the side and the side depending on how it is or the opposite way where both of the what opposite sides are what
congruent keep playing in here cause you won t play at recess if you want to keep playing in here playing and because you want to talk back you don t need to have it for the rest of the week
okay let s look at the real definition real quick a quadrilateral with 2 pairs of congruent parallel sides and 4 right what angles so a quadrilateral hold on
angles 4 right angles she has all day she has all day apparently teacher j is standing right there and if she can see you can see unless you need glasses and you don t know it
mine okay quadrilateral we re going to talk about what a quadrilateral is all right real quick if you did not finish you can look on a partner because we ve got to move on
v how is a rectangle a quadrilateral how is it a rectangle a quadrilateral what is a quadrilateral i know you guys talked about this in 4th grade what is a quadrilateral an equilateral what is a quadrilateral it s a shape with what teacher yeah a quadrilateral is any shape with how many sides
44 so if that s the shape of a rectangle what about a square the same thing so would a square be a quadrilateral then what 4 sides 4 sides is a triangle right and a square can be what a quadrilateral because it has 4 sides a rhombus anything with 4 sides is a what
quadrilateral so you guys are remembering this from 4th grade right one triangles i m not taking a lot of time on this
go what is a triangle it is a shape with 3 sides it is a shape with 3 sides okay good it also is what 3 corners 3 edges all right here s the definition for a triangle are you ready it says a polygon with 3 angles and 3 sides so a polygon
no yes or no what did you say you said no you can t get your work done or yes you can i said yes i can t hear you
okay you need to get moving because we re not doing this every day okay the next one real quick parallelograms those are parallelogram these are not go because we know that all of these are polygons right all of these
that they re all polygons but parallelogram that is a parallelogram so what is different about the parallelogram and how would it be
it s a shape that that s curved is it curved are they curved though a curve would be like this like a circle so a parallelogram okay go get your pencils moving
just leave them on your desk okay a parallelogram what is a parallelogram help me a shape that has i don t think can you hear
no because she s talking and her hands are over her mouth so i do not think she can hear you and we all know you re louder than that so go ahead a shape that has 4 sides that are slanted and have no right angles okay so a shape that has 4 sides that are slanted slightly slanted and has no right angles
c it is a what it s a quadrilateral it is a quadrilateral good shh okay so he s naming other shapes that are parallelograms like squares or rhombuses and rectangles
e we said kind of like a rectangle but it s what
it s kind of like a rectangle a rectangle a square okay it s a rectangle but it s lengthy what do you mean by lengthy did you say lengthy no i said slanted slanted i thought you said lengthy i m like lengthy what do you mean by lengthy okay here s what a parallelogram is
whoever said quadrilateral you were right on the money so a quadrilateral with 2 pairs do we have to write it if we have it exactly right yes
actually we have one task 1st where you re going to try to make other shapes with all of these shapes sense yes so in front of you you have a bag of tangrams and this is a trangram set and in your bag you should have 2 large triangles make sure you have these pieces you should have 2 large triangles
top you should only have 2 so give me back one
you should have 2 large triangles you said we have 2 little triangles no
look at what i m holding up in front so you understand this is where following directions comes into play them yes you said 2 large squares i m sorry 2 large triangles my bad
so you should have 2 large triangles and then you put those to the side and i want you to look for your 2 small triangles so you should have 2 large triangles and 2 small triangles okay you should have 2 small
if you have 3 small i ll take that one i don t have one you don t have small triangles no i don t have any small triangles what are you missing i had 3 no you should have 2 small and one and then you should have like a medium triangle you should have one medium triangle 2 small and 2 large
so who can tell me what we should have in our little bag so far we should have what 2 what 2 big triangles 2 large triangles 22 medium one medium triangle and 2 what small
okay now the other 2 shapes you need to be on the lookout for you need to have one what was this called polygon you need to have one parallelogram and one square square so you should have a total of 7 pieces make sure you have all 7 before you get started i got 7 all right we have 7 okay
now here is your goal and here is your task for the next 10 or 15 minutes and i want to see which person which group which pair can get it done 1st if you combine all of these shapes and put them together and you have to use every single shape you can make a rectangle one rectangle
so your goal or your challenge with your partner or with the people around you is how can you combine these shapes to make a rectangle one entire rectangle ready do we have any questions about what you re supposed to be doing j i don t have a medium triangle you don t have a medium triangle teacher j is coming right to you j all right teacher j is coming to you as well
what do you need honey i don t got big triangles you don t have any big triangles you have one so you need another one okay that is not a rectangle if you have all the pieces if you have all 7 pieces then you may try to start making your rectangle out of all 7 pieces
everybody should have their own rectangle on their desk using their pieces combined you didn t use your square parallelogram you have to use all 7 of your pieces to make a rectangle do that s not a rectangle you don t have a right angle
though keep going remember the characteristics of a rectangle honey patience patience you have to use all 7 pieces you can t not have 2
you have to use all 7 pieces to make the rectangle which team or group can do it 1st can i did it this morning just to make sure i knew how to do it to show you okay i m not giving anybody no hints because almost
you have to use the square and the parallelogram this don t make no you have to manipulate them
go just think about it it almost there she made it it all right got it
you may help your table okay but don t tell them it nope am i almost there now
on shh your rectangle will be like this and this is halfway there with the 2 big triangles you have to try to find listen you you have to make this shape this right here with the remaining pieces
so this side has to equal this with the remaining pieces so how can you use those other pieces to make something that equals that am i halfway there not yet these aren t in the right place teacher b i got it on let keep working but help him out if he needs it
nope these pieces have to equal this on this side
is is that a rectangle does it have 4 angles 4 right angles does it have 2 pairs of parallel sides okay you re almost there i did it
yay did you get it
there you have that triangle in the right place but you re not looking at my drawing at the top because if you looked at the drawing at the top you would know that it has to go this way upset you have that triangle in the right place stop now build from that and finish your rectangle okay
see how did you do that did you do this yes okay why don t you got to s table why don t you go to s table and will work at s table why don t you go to s table to help them
here s your next hint are you ready stop i ll wait i ll wait for you and then i ll just take time off your recess all right the next shape your medium triangle goes like that
go almost done you re really close okay no more
job good are you done yes let me see up i m an idiot for someone who got it you surely got it didn t you good job
almost i showed you where to put this triangle and you didn t listen now try it
i got it it i did it all by myself i m going to take you away from here and he thinks he s got it
once i get to one everyone should be quiet eyes on me and sitting down seat as much as i know you want to help her we re done i think most of you got it now right on if you had to draw it in your notebook we had our medium triangle go this way
go on the side of the triangle on the side of the what multiple students triangle on the medium triangle good here then we had yeah we had a little triangle go right here you had a square on the side well this actually was like what a square
then this was a triangle triangle so some of you were only thinking about how to combine our little triangles and our what square or how to combine the triangles and square most parallelogram the parallelogram because it s not shaped like a normal what
shape does that make sense it looks like a diamond now i have one more i guess challenge for you
ready using these 7 pieces instead of making a rectangle make a square no not a square parallelogram a parallelogram now remember hold on it s going to have to be a rectangle but it s slightly what
that now see what you can do no no these shapes have to be slanted that s the rectangle
this will go down like that you re supposed to make it like a trapezoid i ll give you a hint if you can fill in the middle you re halfway there am i halfway there that s still a rectangle no no
don t give up it you re getting there
okay i ll do this take out the big triangles and then make a parallelogram take out the big triangles make a parallelogram so we want to make a shape
i got this part we want to make a shape like that using these so what we re trying to do is we re trying to make a shape like this using the other pieces
see now try to make it with the other pieces
all right stop stop okay i ll just wait for you and that will be the time i take because i don t think it s raining do we re going to come back after lunch we ll take these back out
okay what have we been talking about with decimals the last few days putting them in arrays arrays okay
else that was team time d multiplying decimals by decimals okay
d area model area models okay today we are going to start looking at division and i know this is something you have done in 4th grade and we will move forward to divide decimals but today we need to look at just dividing whole numbers and what division is
division on a piece of paper i want you to write down a division problem label it and tell me the parts of a division problem write down a division problem and tell me the parts of it
problem you should always have your notes out because you do not know if i am going to give you something to do
you are going to write a dividing problem
divide okay okay can you divide those evenly
groups can you do that minute show me a division problem
divide and show me how to if i have 24 how can i divide that evenly
means yeah okay divide that evenly is it all right if i just did this yeah that is awesome raise your hand if you did it awesome if you are still working finish that problem up
i just want to go on and move on so we can talk about the dividing process and kind of see what division is multiplication what did we say that is another way of doing
or i can just say one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 addition what can we say about division
n another number that is like dividing into another number evenly what is this number called j divi divis divisor divisor okay this is called the divisor
what is this called the number inside the house that you have been taught dividend okay this is the number you are diving into and what is the number i am dividing into in this problem 6 i want to see how many times 6 can go into 24
in division we have the divisor and we have the dividend and what is this answer called up here that is a multiplication remainder the remainder that is what is extra
s quotient this number is called the quotient what is the answer called in multiplication product so there is different terms with multiplication and division with division we have the quotient as the answer
now we are going to look at what is division
okay it is repeated subtraction okay it is multiplication backwards it is kind of doing multiplication backwards even subtracting
like 6 times 4 is 24 okay so if i have these up here how many do i have 10 how would i divide that evenly
i would divide by 10 i can have one 2 3 4 5 and one 2 3 4 5
does everybody see how we have 2 divided groups evenly yes okay
i am going to group each set of 2 group i see how many groups do i have okay i can easily see that i am going to work with 4 groups of 2
so that is all division is okay 32 work that on your paper and see if you can divide that evenly
you can just draw something simple circles or squares and see how to divide that evenly show your work
groups okay evenly divide it up evenly 3 i want even groups so what am i dividing by
evenly so break that up into 2 separate groups how do you divide 32 into 2 separate groups evenly group show it on your paper
groups i said draw 32 and then divide them evenly into 2 groups okay how many would be in 2 groups
32 i did 3 groups of 10 10 20 30 and then my 2 if i wanted 2 groups if i wanted groups evenly if you are going to divide them evenly what am i dividing by i am going even groups like just divided in half
i want 2 even groups 16 in a group
good so how many in each group okay so i am going to take this 1st 16 and then one 2 3 4 5 6
6 here is going to be my other group of 16 you can divide it in half evenly but i saw that did something else he divided it into 4 groups of 8
absolutely when we were looking at the grids for multiplication what are these each so what can we think of these as
tenths so what if i am dividing we said this is just 10 and we said dividing it evenly we can have 5 in each group we can say 10 divided by 2 is how many 5 5 in a group there is 2 groups and i am dividing that into 10
what if i think of this as tenths come on
0 okay there we go so what if i have 10 divided by 0.5 if these are tenths i am taking tenths divided by 0.5 what half half of it just like this
if this is tenths one 2 3 4 5 and then my other group of 5 so we can also divide tenths and hundredths and with a decimal so if i have 10 for tenths i divide it into 0.5
how many groups do i have 2 i have 2 groups of 0.5 i am going to give us a little bit of practice and i want to see how we do
solving i am going to let you work with your group okay paper you may find a place on the floor but i do not want to hear your voices i am going to be coming around working with the problems with you if you have a question you use your team member to help discuss it and solve it
room i want you to work with your group and i will be coming around to monitor and help you as you come along get this is going to be some problem solving with dividing this can we whisper to our group yes
you can talk to your group members to discuss the problem asking what do we need to find out and what is the information we already know in the problem group you may use an inside whisper voice to talk to your group and try to work these out
this you can write the answers on here but i do want to see work shown on another piece of paper or somewhere can we write on the back if you number it nice and neat and keep track of your answers yes
you going to sit here
yes okay dividing yes it is a simple one but just show where you have done the problem
candy how many will each person get
okay the group has 6 people so we need to see how many pieces of candy each person is going to get i will come over there in just a 2nd okay here is your 6 people
6 that is your 6 people so let us put these candies with each person and see how many we get okay so put these candies in each group and see how many each person gets
you understand okay each okay there is another piece of candy evenly okay there is another piece of candy
groups okay another piece of candy okay each group there is 6 people so how many pieces of candy
okay tell me how many candies are in each group
candy how are we doing are we on number 2 we are on number one
fact they are trying to get you to see that when you are dividing how many pieces of candy will each person in the group get 6 if we have 36 pieces of candy each person is going to get what 6
okay if we have 60 people in the group and we have 360 pieces of candy how many pieces are they going to get different so you are still going to have to divide it because i know you are not going to draw out 360
this is a little bit easier to draw out but here you do not have to draw that out but if you divide it it is going to be a little bit different how are we doing you need to get a pencil
pencil you did not give me one yesterday not yesterday day yes i did
together i do not know why we can not work together but i want you to talk it out and work together what are you doing for number one up we are just talking about division today
can i want to teach you division and i want you to learn division we have 36 pieces of candy and we have 6 people
get how many pieces of candy is each person going to get
it one 2 3 4 5 6 pieces all right you do division and then you do multiplication you can check your answer with multiplying but there is really no answer no 100 murray has $100 to spend on the t shirts for 8 members of his soccer team
each shirt costs $7.75 money this is kind of a multi step that okay
yes and have money leftover yes so that would be right now we need help on number 4 how would the quotient what is the quotient it is the answer how would the quotient change in 12 divided by 48
it is 12 into 48 if 48 was increased to 4810 instead of 12 divided by 48 if 48 was increased to 480 how would the quotient change
more they are wanting you to explain and tell how much more it would be 4 so if 48 was increased to 480 divided by 12 then explain that in words i want you all to think this year use your brain cells
i know that it added a 0 that it does not really matter what do you mean it is going to change the number but the quotient stays the same no not by making a bigger number it is not
okay when you all divide here we said if there is 36 pieces of candy and 6 people one 2 3 4 5 6 okay so i know if each person in this problem if there is 6 people and we are dividing 36 pieces of candy we know each person is going to get how many pieces of candy 6 so each person is going to get 6 pieces of candy
it says if our group had 60 people and i had 360 pieces of candy how many will each person get 60 where is your 1st number going to go when you divide your quotient answer is going to go over the number that you are dividing by
dividing it is going to go above the 0 no that is 60 divided by 36
0 if it has 60 people had 360 pieces of candy how many will each person in the group get if i just take away the 0 and divide and take away the 0 from both and divided it then add back the 0
for number 3 we can put the quotient 6 stays the same but not in the same exact spot use the parts of a division equation division quotient dividend and remainder to answer the following question what changed in the problem one and 2 and what stayed the same the quotient stayed the same you are right by so it is explaining your answer
that s what they are wanting you to sorry babe they are wanting you to be able to explain it problem no i am not saying draw 360 fine as long as you are just showing the work that is when you just do the math to show the work out this one is a little bit easier but no i am not asking you to draw out 360
thing how would the quotient change in 48 divided by 12 if 48 was increased to 480 words i am going to give you about 5 more minutes and then we are going to talk about it
answers you need to use your voice with your team members you i did i want to hear you talking to your group
i want to see the work on your paper i talked to them okay did do the math problem you come here i want to show you come around count out 36
count out 36
one if the group had 60 people and i had 360 pieces of candy and 60 people how many will each person get
so divide that and see how many you will get
these are 2 together hold on
36 there is 6 people one 2 3 4 5 6 people now put these candies in each group
no here is your 6 groups one 2 3 4 5 6 in okay
about one more minute and we are going to go back to our seats and talk about this
group you need to see what they think too and if they are getting the same thing
this many you are multiplying it says how would the quotient change in 12 divided by 48 if 48 was increased
i was trying to show that 12 times 40 would equal 480 that good so if 48 was increased to 480 and you are still dividing by 12 what is going to change 4 you would add a 0
put that in words not just that you would add a 0 but that the quotient would become 40 let us practice explaining things this year zeros i like doing stuff like this you do
very good cool we are going to be doing a lot of problem solving are decimals and fractions the same kind of yes
yes any fraction can be turned into a decimal that okay
twice if you will quietly go back to your seat we are going to talk about these and make sure we have all the right answers and understand them
me okay hang on
that okay that good this was the beginning of it
i want us to get more familiar with can you get those on thank you babe with dividing because dividing is a skill that we will see all throughout your life even as an adult you go to the grocery store and you need to know how to divide things out
you need to group things and see what is going to go evenly with money things like that i want to make sure you understand these problems and what they are asking
so for number one what was the question asking
our group has 6 people i have 36 pieces of candy how many will be split into the group evenly so we are going to have 36 pieces of candy know how many people in our group
6 6 people will you hit the front light this is a simple dividing problem because we are trying to see how many groups of candy how many will each person get in that group
6 here is my 6 groups person all you are doing is putting those 36 pieces of candy in a group 6 each person is going to get 6 candies
36 i am not dividing into 3 so when i put my quotient the number at the top i am going to put it over the 6 because i am dividing 6 into this whole thing 36 not 3 j okay
hurts go ahead and take her down and tell her that her head hurts and we were going to do the crackers in just a 2nd 6 i am going to put my 6 above the 2nd number in my quotient because i am dividing 6 into 36 not 3
that yes so then i am going to multiply back 6 times 6 and i am going to follow it through we know it is a simple division problem
for number 2 if our group had 60 people and 360 pieces of candy how many pieces are we going to get 6 just because i have a 0 here and a 0 here my number when i divide 60 is it going to go over the 6 here
no i am going to divide 60 into this whole thing and we know it will go 6 times 6 times 0 and 6 times 6 it will still come out evenly but i am dividing much bigger numbers
the quotient is the same but it will be in a different place because i have a 0 here okay for number 3 use the parts of a division equation divisor quotient dividend and remainder to answer the following what changed in problem one and 2 and what stayed the same
one the dividend and the divisor okay my quotient is still the same right my 2 numbers i am dividing by are much bigger okay
so you just want to make sure that you understand that your dividend and divisor is larger by a multiple of 10 but my quotient stays the same 6 okay
number 4 how would the quotient change in 12 divided by 48 well we know 12 into 48 that is a simple math fact that we should know 4 so i am going to divide 4 and notice my 4 is above that last number in the quotient
what if i have what if 48 was turned into 480 into 12 4 now i am dividing into it is not going to be 4 12 will go into 48 12 times
okay i am going to subtract and bring down my 0 and i still have to divide 12 into 0 and it will go 0 times time so if this number does not change look what happens to the answer here i have 12 into 48 and here i have 12 into 480 difference so what happened to my quotient then
it increased it increased by what by 0 by from 4 to 40
36 from 4 to 40 it is 4 groups of 10 okay so it is going up but it is a multiple of 10 because we are adding a 0 because 40 is a multiple of 10 right okay
then number 5 murray has $100 to spend on t shirts and the 8 members of his soccer team here each shirt is $7.75 multiply i have to find out how much i spent on all the shirts
i know each shirt is this and i know i have to buy 8 shirts so i am going to multiply and here i am multiplying the decimal like we have been doing 8 times 5 40 carry the 4 7 times 8 56
60 then 8 times 7 62 62 what bananas dollars make sure you put your dollar sign when you deal with money okay so the question was does he have enough money
if all the shirts are $62 and we have $100 did he have enough left yes obviously we know 62 is less than 100 and we will have some left over okay folder if you did not finish you can revisit these later
today we will continue with dividing tomorrow please get your things ready to switch over to ms
all right boys and girls last night i asked you to use fraction using factor trees and i want to take just a couple of minutes to review a few of the problems to make sure you have this down pat and then we are going to move on and take a look at percents
all right so when you did your factor trees last night how many of you found that it made reducing your fractions a whole lot easier okay how many of you still like using greatest common factor fine how many of you like using divisibility rules okay so we have decided we are not going to use divisibility rules today
you might decide in the future you would rather use them again and that is fine but for our purposes today we are going to go back to factor trees all right so pull out one of those fractions that you think would be a really cool one to take a look on how to factor so that we can reduce this fraction you if you cannot find your homework right now you will just need to write it down in your blue folder
all right 6 sixteenths the very 1st question i am going to ask myself with 6 sixteenths is this if someone came up to me and said i have 6 sixteenths of a pie for you missus b is that going to make a whole lot of sense to me am i really going to be able to picture in my brain what 6 sixteenths is going to look like
reduce and so then i look at my fraction and what is the next question i am going to ask myself yes does 6 go into 16 evenly perfect will 6 go into 16 evenly without having a remainder no if the answer was yes what would i do to the numerator you have to divide the top and the bottom by 6 very good
right you would circle the 6 and then divide the top into the bottom the numerator into the denominator r you put 16 next to 6 and then you make a tree good we are going to start we are going to make a tree for 6 and we are going to make a tree for 16
all right so when i make a tree for 6 the very 1st question i ask myself for 6 is what what question will i ask c 2 times 3 i am going to ask myself what 2 numbers can i use and multiply them together and get 6 and that will work for 2 times 3 now i do not want to use one and 6 right
3 outside of one and 21 times 2 is 2 and one and 31 times 3 is 3 can i break these down anymore to reduce them or to make them smaller no which means that in this case the 2 is what kind of number good and the 3 is what kind of number
number so then i am going to come back over here and i am going to write my 2 factors for 6 right there we are done with 6 for the moment what am i going to do with 16 d we will see what can go into 16 right and so which 2 numbers have you chosen to go into 16
8 times 2 okay 8 time 222 is a prime number it is a prime number so i am going to circle that and i am finished with 2 for the time being not what 2 numbers could i use to multiply together to get 84 times 24 times 2
22 is prime and 4 is not 2 is prime numbers so in this case 2 times 222 factors when we finish our factor tree for 16 right
so we have 222 and 2 trick whenever you have 1234 like that that is actually the number 2 to the 4th power me you will say 0 missus b told me that because you write the same number that many times
is 88 times 2 is this if we have a 2 on the top and a 2 on the bottom what do we do good now we have one number left on the top so it automatically slides over to be the numerator is 688 that is right
2 times 2 is 4 times 2 is 8 so now in my brain can i picture if had a pie and it was cut into 8 pieces because that does happen i have had a pie before cut into 8 pieces or a pizza cut into 8 pieces and i am going to get 3 pieces of that pizza now can my mind comprehend that better than saying 0 you are going to get 6 sixteenths of a pizza yeah we have reduced it to lowest terms
whenever you have a fraction that looks like this ask yourself the question can it be reduced yes 62 times 2 is 44 times 2 is 80 that now what if we wanted to go back and we wanted to do the bucket way
do you do a bucket for 6 all right let us do a bucket for 6 what is a bucket for 61 times 61 times 62 times 32 times 33 times 23 times 2 that s a repeat so we are finished
divide 2 whatever you do to the top you have to do to the out we had the same number
so whatever strategy you use whether it be through factor trees that is terrific if you feel more comfortable using find the greatest common factor between those 2 number by using them in a bucket that is cool too right now i want to practice some more with people at the back of the room on this sort of thing
and then we have today some folks may use their time to journal back mimio for wednesday people me cards if you use the cards remember you can do this by teams or we can you have 4 playing
you only need one deck to draw your cards and build your fractions from those questions does anyone not know where to go right now if you are with me will you please bring last night is homework paper with you so that we can work through these
go actually leave yes because we need them for the mimio yes
fine will you calibrate for me
you all right 0 thank you is it just me and
z come on buddy all right everybody okay for will you please just pick a whiteboard quickly thank you did it calibrate okay
okay you can use it for your whiteboard all right guys quickly thank you funny take a look at your paper from last night and if there was one that you want to start with so we can work together
together 8 twentieths 8 twentieths all right 8 over 20 okay what is the 1st question you are going to ask yourself do tree
it what 2 numbers did you use to multiply together to get 84 times 24 times 2 and we got the 2 so what are we going to do with the 2 going and what to get 42 times 2
and they are also prime so if i use that earlier do you remember how i did 2 with a 4 up that is called an exponent and so if i had 2 times 2 times 22 times 2 is 4 times 2 is 8 how do you think i could write that with an exponent 2 with a if you did the 2 with the little 3 do you know how you read that
bonus ready 2 cubed awesome all right so 2 times 2 times 2 go for our fraction here we will have 222 do you agree
too all right now let us check out what happens with 20 what 2 numbers did you use something what if i had decided to use 2 times 10 would it have still worked
why because you get the same answers to get the same answers all right here we go 4 and what about 2 they are both prime those are both prime numbers good and so then down here i am going to write 52 and 2
agree yeah what if i wanted to write the 2s like i did with this one what do you think i would do with that and then the exponent the little 2 right there no squared squared yeah 2 is squared 3 is cubed
2 and anytime you say 2 times 2 times 22 times 2 is 4 times to is 82 cubed is always going to be 8 so whenever you see that just think 82 squared is 2 times 24 all right so there is a little bonus all right here we go
what do i do now that i have my factors there there is a 2 on the top and the bottom a 2 on the top and the bottom and you do that again to get another and what is left 5 and a 2 automatically how would that feel you like it
better yeah sort of or does it just take a little practice sure then lets practice another one why do not you pick one this time 110 over 24 will 10 go into 24
not so why do not you see how far you can work this one and then we ll work it together while you are doing that i will be right back and check on everyone else fractions we are doing that is multiplication
cards fractions we were going to do that but is that a 2 player game or just 3 no you could have played with 2 or 4 people area right and there were 12340 you know what
cards will you please go get the right cards out of the crate for me yes that is right you are doing fine yes can stay but you have to get the other cards because we are not using those cards today thank you all right boys where is your center
here we are done on our center then you can come work with me or you could actually go get why do not you try the candy cane exemplar you can work it together the candy corn exemplar try that one together i am so sorry you all right okay did you finish your journal
exemplar it is right there under the pocket there just leave that one out and i ll fix it later thank you
okay we ll fix it later that will be good are you finished okay good let us try it let us find a tree for 10 to start with do we each get one sheet yes you each should have a sheet all right what 2 numbers did you use to multiply to find 15 and 2 and you know what the coolest thing is about this
prime they are both prime and whenever you see the number 10 you might get to the point in your head where you automatically thing 5 and 2 and you do not have to work up the tree anymore board you might automatically think 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 and you just write the 42s down all right tell me about 24
use 2 times 122 times 12 what did you use 4 times 64 times 6 and what did you use 4 times 6 all right we are going to do it both ways 12 yes that one gets a little 12 is because what did you use after 12
number and then what did you use for 62 are they prime sure and so we have 23222322 now if you did 6 times 4 the same thing will happen
6 times 43222 all right do you have it now prime and then let us compare 2322 they ll still come out the same even if you do use different numbers all right do we have a 5 on the bottom
bottom so we are going to slide over the 5 now what is 3 times 2212 now your reduced fraction should be 5 twelfths is that easier to visualize in your head yes i get the same answer did you use 38s for 24
i got a different for the bottom what did you get on the bottom do you remember ah man all right so has picked one and has picked 11 i ll let you pick one next does anyone want this chart for tonight i ll take it
it okay we will probably have enough time for each of you to have a turn so put that to the side it all right what number do you want 28 over 4028 over 40 okay see how far you can work it out on your own
own 28 fortieths if someone said that they had 28 fortieths of a piece pizza of pizza pie a whole pie i do not know that would be hard for me to figure out
calendar all right do you have any fraction problems in your calendar that you are working on today lots of fractions this time around where is your calendar i want to see where you are actually showing your works before you showing your work before you colored in
me all right show your work please teacher yes 2 all right what they have a remainder at all do round it
happens did you already work it out that quickly it what factors well 1st of all will 28 go into 40 evenly did all right but it doesn t so let us do a factor tree for 28
use 4 and 77 all right and for 4 we automatically know it is going to be 2 and those are both prime so on this line we are going to have 22 and 7 and what did i tell you the other 2 is
22 what is that called squared 2 squared we will talk about this when we do measurement the square part and you will already have that so try to tuck that away right there all right let us take a look at 40 okay okay 4 we re going to have 2 and 2 again
prime and for 10 what did you use 5 times 2 both prime prime so on the bottom then we have
222 and a 5 we have a 2 on the top 2 on the bottom 2 on the top 2 on the bottom
yeah good good good all right cool so then if in my brain if i can picture a pizza in 10 slices i am going to have 7 i am going to be stuffed but i can figure that out way better than 28 fortieths of something one let us see you are up
21 over 3621 over 36 all right see how far you can get
for my friends at mimio i would prefer that you have something fraction related thank you do i need to reset it for you okay i think you might be able to there you go
out sit down did you have 7 as the numerator that is all right let us retrace it okay that is great trouble all right did you have the 3322
here wait you had 32 okay so you had 2323 at the bottom all right that was okay numbers you must have made a mistake when you did you cross out x out a 3 and a 3 he has 43s 0 you had 43s i see okay
366 times 6 okay let us look at that again 6 that should have been 23 and then 23 do you see where you made your mistake sure all right okay so this chart goes to
sure where do you get those kind of papers i got this at like office max or office depot sure that would be fun i mean you can get i have a whiteboard also that is this same size
unfortunately i wrote on it with a permanent marker that pretty much destroyed
chalkboard would be fine but those whiteboards are fun too i have a whiteboard do you i have a whiteboard i have 2 different whiteboards i have one that is connected to a clipboard and i can not write on it standing up because it is hanging on the wall in the middle of it
i can not sit that one down and i have one that my teacher gave me in 3rd grade that i have been using well that is good practice though try one more problem here
work 28 we just did that one we did we just did it my friends in the front corner you may put away that game and you may go work on your calendar at your seat much all of us yes but just came under here i am taking care of your group 1st
you i noticed after i had to call them down that you were involved so you may go back to your seat as well and work on your calendar thank you reaction for the 8th time i end up calling you do you understand i am finished seat i have to clean up all those cards because of him
let us pick one real quick 14 over 24 let us go ahead and work that out while and i figure this out come here i got one over 4 and you got 2 tenths were these yours yes up you and i will discuss this later if you have a problem with what i have asked you to do write me a letter and we ll talk about it
in the meantime and i have one of your sticks from yesterday those your calendar thank you teacher yes
what do you think candy corn what do you think candy corn tastes like what do you think heaven on earth hates it well that is because everybody is taste buds are different i know he asked me and then he asked is that part of the exemplar it use a simile or a metaphor to tell me about candy corn
this 14 did you use 2 and 7 oops 7 times 2 prime yes it is the same it is the same numbers cool so we have 7 and 2 on the top 24 maybe use 3 times 8 or 6 times 4 or 12 times 2
number 8 we are going to have 2 times 4 then we are going to have 2 times 2 so we have prime number 7 and 2322 and 23222 cross out a 2 here
is 1212 now the last fraction that we had was which one we had 14 over 24 and then 21 over 28 36 now we have 7 over 12 when we reduce them what do you think we could say then about those 3 fractions
yes excuse me you all right let us try one more and then we are going to call it a day for this part measure just for fun
yes do we have to do it using the family tree the family tree well factor tree the factor tree what is the 1st question you should ask yourself yourself will 4 go into 12
yes will 4 go into 120 i thought that would throw you a little curveball it helps good good got it now
please what do you mean a packet right there on what the exemplars fine all right so let us go around the room for just a moment and let us debrief
give each other a little bit of an idea of what happened in your centers today mimio i had it set up for math percentages and decimals and fractions which game did you think was the best today that you would recommend for the people that have mimio tomorrow hm i notice you were playing sugar and i know that is a lot of fun boombot 2
2 i didn t like sugar you didn t like sugar but boombot 2 is it pretty cool yeah okay tell me what makes that a great mimio game for fractions much okay tomorrow please stay on those people who are in mimio please stay on the fractions and percents for the people who drew the cards to make their fractions what was the best part of that game
game like it helped you more with fractions like i understood it more better like as an example 2 tenths as like you can reduce that and get 15th okay all right that is okay
exemplar was it easy middle if you ve not tried that one yet you get to give your opinion on the taste of candy corn no do neither of the s like candy corn fine and for the people that worked on calendar which problem today was the easiest to solve for you
the sphere thing the one with the sphere the sphere favor would you bring me that baggie of the blue cubes you all right and my friends that were back here with me today what was the best part a about the square should we tell everybody else
okay with the factor trees if you will join us here you you need to please be seated properly all right one of the things that we learned was that when we factored a number like 8 we had 2 times 4 and then we factored that again and we ended up with 22 and 2
when you write that with what is called an exponent how many times did you write the number 2 times so you would write the 2 and you would write a small 3 which is called an exponent and that is called cubed
and as you get older in your math classes if you ever see 2 cubed you will automatically think 8 because 2 times 2 is 4 times 2 is 8 so 2 cubed will always be 8 all right yes 2 means like i knew this but you can do it
it my cousin told me 5 years ago well that was sweet of your cousin to teach you 5 years ago perfect so in your head and n i still can not see you
check so in your brain you are thinking i have 2 twice and 2 times 2 is 4 then think it through
2 in my brain i have to think this pattern i have a question 93 squared is 9 because you are actually repeating the 32 times and you are multiplying that you are actually repeating the 32 times and you are multiplying that do you see that yes okay those are called exponents we will use them when we talk about measurement when we talk about square yards and things like that
tomorrow how many of you are excited to think that on your social studies test friday you might score 100% it if you got a bonus question which we will not have on this one i apologize for that too if we had a bonus question and you got 5 bonus points what would your score then be
so if i had 100 and then i had will you hold those 2 for me 23 how would i write that as a decimal number 123
how would i write that as a decimal one.231.23 yes absolutely right fraction you would put 123 over 100 yes 123 over 100
you and if we divided 100 into 123 i promise you we would get one.23 so then if we write that as a percent it would 123% do you see that now i need you to travel back to your seat in one moment
and when you do please clear your desk because it is time for recess you may
all righty can you read the math goals for today
will be able to multiply decimals students will be able to recite the process of multiplying decimals all righty so let s go over
decimals what have we done so far with decimals someone please share and tell us g subtracting decimals subtracting decimals what else have we done with decimals t identifying place identifying place value with decimals
done e we learned decimals least to greatest how did you get that
j from greatest to least least to greatest and greatest to least very nice decimals i want to quickly review subtracting decimals before we move on items you are going to have $20 to start with okay i want you to subtract an item that i tell you to subtract okay you ready
$20 i want you to subtract the pizza from$20
i like it
8 this is a one
board you may sit watch and see if you are in agreement with l if you agree with his difference please give him a thumbs up
and explain to us what you are doing i can t really hear you to well
playground then you go to the 2 and you have got then you subtract 10 -9 is one
0 9 -8 is one and then you bring a one down and to subtract all right if you agree with please give him a thumbs up
missing 0 yeah so i half and half agree with you you nice how do i read this e okay so now you have $11.01 and even after eating all this pizza you still decided that you are very very very hungry
breakfast and you passed by a truck that selling ice cream and you are like umm strawberry my favorite i have $11.01 and i want to buy that strawberry ice cream cone
over line up his decimal yes he did this is correct go ahead buy that ice cream cone
when you are done figuring out how much money you have then please stand up
do huh let me see 9 -2 is 8
one that s a surprise explain to us what you do okay
beautiful teacher d is going to yell at you if you do not line up the decimals you right board so when you come up to the board how do i expect you to write in on this huge board
it and not only are you used supposed to write big enough you can space out your numbers so they are not one on top of the other e follow what does and look along
and if you agree with him please give him a thumbs up when he is done
$7.72 if you agree with give him a thumbs up
it after eating that pizza and going to that truck and eating an ice cream you keep walking along the street and you realize that they are selling your favorite food and you are going to make room you don t know how but you are going to make room because this hot dog looks really amazing
so subtract the hot dog from what you have and let s see how much money you have left over after buying a pizza and ice cream cone and a hot dog
lot i hope you are full after this
you did the 2nd problem can you call on someone to do the last one already 0 why is still have his hand up
on shhh don t forget to tell us what you are doing
7 -5 is 2 $5 -0 i thought you said plus
$5.22 if you have $5.22 as your final difference after buying pizza ice cream and hotdog please give me a thumbs up
wow no it s right there okay so when we re subtracting numbers when we are subtracting and adding decimals what are the rules for subtracting and adding decimals g wants to repeat that i know he does rule line up your decimals line up your decimals good what s another rule
l add zeros if you need too add zeros in the places that are empty to hold that spot r which number goes on top the biggest the bigger numbers goes on top rules again the smaller number goes on the bottom okay so if the bigger number goes on top and the smaller numbers goes on the bottom
d you add and subtract the way that you normally would from right to left before we start multiplying decimals you need to keep something in mind and remember what this is and i hope you do remember it digit all of you should know what s a digit we went over it on paper that we just did
j no what s a digit number so how many digits does this number have 3 and what are those digits
have and what are those digits they okay how many digits does this have what are they how many digits does this number have
4 what are they nice okay so when you are multiplying decimals you do not line up the decimal points you do not line up the decimal points the number on top is the number with the most digits
important then you line up the other number underneath right i ll show you what i mean by this but you have to count the number of decimal places after the decimal
okay then at the end you have to use a total of decimal places after the decimal or total number of digits after the decimal in your answer and this is how we are going to practice doing the decimal dance because that s going to help you up you ready
read go ahead shake hips m ready okay now when you are dealing with multiplying decimals you are going to be moving the decimal point this way
ahead go it go ahead move those decimal places boom boom boom boom sit please copy down this example
5.82 times one one
all righty with 5.82 how many digits are there after the decimal so after means to the right of the decimal
decimal so i have 2 decimal places or digits please write that down right next to 5.82 digits you need to pay attention write that down
5.82 focus okay let s look at one one how many digits after the decimal 11 digit after the decimal what number is that
one so please write in one decimal place or digit after we do that we add up how many decimal places digits in total are there in our problem
so i add up my 2 digits here and my one digit here get 33 digits so please copy that down
way you can do it the classic way or you can do it the break apart way but multiply those 2 numbers together as if there are no decimals in them
line and then this one is 0 times 10 and 0 times 8 and 0 times 5 0 so got 582
thing i ll give you 30 more seconds for those of you who are still working
here simple enough right okay so in between your answer i want you to write bars to separate them
okay does everyone have bars to separate them
you after you have your answer i want you to have bars to separate your different places you trying to steal my marker ready yes this is where our decimal dance comes to play so when you have your answer after multiplying the numbers as if decimals didn t exist you are going to put your decimal point at the end
start so put your decimal point after the 2 this tells us how many places we need to move to the left places 33 so i m going to go from this bar to this bar
going 233 so your decimal point ends here so your answer is 582 thousandths okay dancing yeah we re going to try another one
can i erase yes you have any questions yeah you could multiply inaudible okay i want you to do it this way
okay all righty how many digits after that decimal how many digits after that decimal place place 2 and what are they
way 44 and 5 too that 0 right no decimal places there so how many places do i need to move in total 2 decimal places or digits +0 decimal places or digits equals
22 decimal places or digits all righty so i want you to change this as if there were no decimals in it
all righty so our product is 11610 that very nice h what do i need to do between those digits before i even move my decimal
draw lines put bars in between them
m after the 0 after the 0 so i m going to start it here m 22 decimal places right remember we did this time 10 9 8 there we go
over boom how many places did i move it over going boom how many places did i move it over 22 so now that is where my decimal stays
so our answer is 116 and 10 hundredths very nice all righty any questions so far no i want you to do this one in your groups
out the same way we just did it
go don t forget to say how many decimal places or digits are after the decimal for each number
how many digits after the decimal we start with that 1st down and the bottom one hum so how many in total it seems like we re working independently
you know what i did before i even started my problem is i counted how many decimals were after the decimal and i don t see that on your paper but i see that on which means you guys are not working together so can you share what you did before you even started
go how many digits after the decimal
digits hum do we line up decimals in multiplication no
3 okay so now i know this is your way to do it 563
37 go ahead 3 dimes 5 15
hum 15 how many zeros do we attach 3 good 7 times 5 count by 5s is 5 10 15 20 25 30 35
so after you have your product put your bars in between this way right 0 you did it yeah beautiful i didn t see you dancing though so there s a problem
part good i see has his are those supposed to be the bars bars how many decimal places are you supposed to move it
3 this answer is different from this answer 2 decimal places and one decimal place equals how many decimal places
3 huh okay so erase this the whole thing
number one with the dance one all righty put bars
you only moved 12 how many do you need to move start how many places do you need to move it down so it needs to go from this bar to this bar that is how many
3 write your number down write your answer stay okay can i have a group come up to the board to show how they did it this is including solving your answer finding the product
bars and getting that decimal place to where it needs to be
what does your answer end up being your product what s your product 20 and
can you move out of the way for a 2nd so how many of you for your product got 20831 also known as 20831 hands up okay so is putting all those digits behind bars
you always put your decimal at the end to start good there you go i want to see those hips move nice so your final answer is 20 what did you say
20 and 831 hundredths what did he say 20 and good excellent excellent excellent if you got the same thing please stand up
nice very very nice this all righty with your groups
do actually just for the sake of time just select one any one of those as a group decide on any one of those to do that s the thing you want to do easy or you want to actually challenge yourself and do something a little bit more difficult
c b s right in the middle b challenge okay i want you guys to work on it just like you did before together okay okay
before okay which one did you guys decide on group 34 you mean so why don t you do something in the middle why don t you do b
b so that it s in the halfway point b which one are you guys doing c one does 0 count no just one of them counts just pick one of them okay
it that s 5 and 5 tenths 0 is this a bar i thought it was number one nice so we are writing down the decimal places after the decimals how many places in total
yet not yet ah come on
hey we don t say that here did you solve it
can we work together as a group because some of us are still behind and we are not even close to being student g
if you are done you can work on another one
how many decimal places that s because you added an extra one
see you made the problem harder what answer did you get aren t you finished with that problem put your answers behind bars
how many places do you need to move 2 hum let me see what your answer is
it s kind of hard to read his handwriting good did you do it the break apart way
all righty so i was able to go around and see that you guys did great work together done are you finished okay so now what i want you to do is i want you to get with your learning partner and in your student activity book unit 6
i want you to work on pages 67 and 68 with your partner
why don t you work with yeah work with and
no you didn t so switch them i like this this has more digits than this one so this goes on top how you doing
how many places do you need to move it over
how many places do you move your decimal good
numbers one i don t see you moving go ahead hey
it s fine 0 no 0 no i ll work here let s work on the next one
i m just here because is in the bathroom
here and this is the same number that i m talking i m talking about this number
here where do you see the decimal so how many places do you need to move it
answer okay write it down here you know this one
do you know these do you know this one how many zeros do you need to attach 2
go excellent you are doing great can you work with on number 4 come on
how many places do you move it over just one hum let me see
can you work with him okay when you are done with page 67 move on to page 68
it hum solve it with not by ourselves right eyes up
work with work with too go ahead i want to hear what you guys are talking to each other about
well if 110th is one dime how much is 6 dimes 6 tenths yeah 6 tenths exactly
pennies if that s one penny how about 6 of those
600 pennies 6 hundredths right is that how you write 6 hundredths how do you say that number 6000 is that what the answer is
how do you say that number 600s is this a decimal point where s the decimal point what place does this end in
hundredths it s only one place after the decimal tenths so how do you say that number here you don t see a pattern here
spot hum sign out
hum a lot of erasing on that paper over there okay
68 read what it says on the board why aren t you solving it
no no it s 2 digits hum how many digits after the decimal 2
let s go over page 67 did we say 0 just say 8
100 hundredths good and go over these problems you moved it over 3 places
here so the 1st one is 1400 so what do you need to do
14 and 110th yeah where do you get the one
it you only move it one place right one and 4 tenths yes
he s right because if you had the the decimal point can move one time okay so what are some things that you notice about multiplying decimals
e that it has pattern depending on it s place value doesn t it j do you line up your decimals in multiplication no do not line up your decimals decimals the bigger number on top not the bigger number
the number with the most decimals the most class so you are going to do one move and then pass your marker along and let s see how fast we can do this one problem together ready yes what i want you to do is solve it the way that we solved it in class
here count up the decimal digit place here okay product then you are going to put your answer behind bars ready who wants to get started pass it on to someone else
on good
come on come on come on next person get it places total decimal places total decimal places total decimal places
go de she spelled in spanish de places all right so student m determined for us that we moved 2 decimal places
places good next person next person come on come on come on good next next next next go ahead
yet whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no no go back up there
up okay
bars go ahead go ahead go ahead yep went didn t go
the decimal place we always start where t what s our final answer someone write down our final final final answer go ahead you started us off you are doing to finish it
who can say our final answer answer and 12 hundredths one more person say it
j 1236 and 12 hundredths and i want to hear a girl t 136 and 12 hundredths okay so before we end today stand up stand up
up all righty you ready decimal dance 12 that way go go go go go go go i like it music very nice work
all right class we ll start off with our time test and then we re going to real quick review for your test tomorrow short it s not one of the longer tests we ve done this year i m not sure though because i made it new
group i m not sure thought that it s not going to take a little while to do cause some of the problems are a little involved i guess meaning that you re going to have to do more than one step away when you get this just put your name at the top over we re going to try and do this in 5.5 minutes so we ve broken the 6 minute mark
minutes all right name at the top paper flipped over ready set wait come on guys we ve got to go
go okay we ve started
normal and that was 5.5 minutes right on the nose so it s the quickest we ve done this guys we re going to go through this quickly and read through the answers trade like normal after we re done and we get these back hold on to it you re going to need the back of this for what we re going to do after we review for tomorrow s test that all right guys quickly now keep up with me
fast row a 20 60 108 99 96 80 72 70 60 and 48
okay row b 48 40 90 120 56 9 24 24 44 121
72 are you checking the paper in front of you
yes row d 48 33 36 20 56 126 32 108 42 and 36
row e 12 132 96 20 63 180 27 105 28 165
up okay row f 18 36 24 108 24 70 96 168 24 and 27
row g 24 40 45 44 180 66 56 64 90 and 24
row h 55 18 28 144 16 0 72 40 32 and 121
row i 36 108 98 36 154 135 120 48 165 and 96 and the guys the last row row j 48 48 150 63 20 132 60 42 96 and 121
go ahead and count up the number correct and then give it back to whomever it was you graded
now so we ve crossed that magical 6 minute mark finally 80s okay hold on to these just set these aside cause you re going to need them again shortly at least the back part your test tomorrow girls you re with me back there right
okay that s twice now i ve had to stop for you or actually 3 times anyway tomorrow s test not that long right now it s only 2 pages i m thinking about adding a few so at the most it s going to be 3 there are some protractor questions but there aren t going to be any where you get a circle and then you have to figure out what the angles are within the circle
i m not going to do that because i m finding it hard to make the circle big enough you remember that was a problem when we did the homework assignment the other day the angles were so small it was almost too hard to measure those those do not show up at least they never have before test they ve never showed up on the crct before so i don t think they re that important to do
but what you will see guys are problems like this where you have a circle and it s broken down like this and you have to figure out what the angles must equal
so if this is 90 and this is 90 and let s say this is 50 degrees and this is 30 degrees and this is what 60 degrees how would you figure out what this is
h you would add up all the angles and subtract it from 360 exactly every angle you were given you add it up 360 360 degrees what if you are given and guys you will be given this by the way what if you are given a triangle
let s say the triangle looks like this and i give you this is 100 degrees and this is 30 degrees how would you figure out what this missing and we ll call this angle a again is remember this is a triangle this was a circle
with a circle you added up the angles you had and you subtracted from 360 now this is a triangle that changes things a little bit thing you add up the 2 angles you have but where it s different is what do you subtract from
180 and guys i ve seen kids do that before where they will mix the 2 up and they ll get a triangle and guess what they subtract from yeah they subtract from 360 or they get a circle and guess what they subtract from 180 what if it is a rectangle
let s say tomorrow on the test you get a rectangle and i give you i won t even write them up here 360 what if it s a triangle like this
that what if it s a shape that looks like a triangle only it s not a triangle because it doesn t have 3 sides and let s say you get all the angles but one of this shape
right by the way because for whatever reason this kept tripping my class up last year what if i give you a circle and there s a straight line and the question is just how many degrees is that angle right are we good with all that yes the other thing guys go back to the shape real quick
this shape has one 2 3 4 5 sides sides pentagon raise your hand please pentagon so you would call this a pentagon but you would have to put another name in front of it it s not just a pentagon because it s not a normal looking pentagon
pentagon so what do you call it irregular pentagon it is an irregular pentagon right so guys there are probably i looked at the test this morning
there are probably 7 or 8 questions where i simply give you a shape and you have to tell is it a regular pentagon or is a irregular irregular pentagon girls i think you know quadrilateral right yeah pentagon is a 5 sided shape
again hexagon hexagon a 10 sided shape okay and guys you also have to tell if they re irregular like this was or regular like this thing is
good okay the other thing guys and the last thing on the test you have to tell me angles actually then within that shape guys you re going to have different angles
this and remember this would be angle a angle b angle c angle d e you may have to measure an angle
so for instance guys if you get a shape like this you may get a question what s the measurement of angle a b c 180 it s going to be 180 degrees don t let those questions trip you up
complicated if it is a triangle i don t care what kind of triangle be it isosceles right triangle equilateral triangle whatever okay so guys those should be simple questions for you
then the last thing these i m hoping are easy cause i know you ve had them since 3rd grade this it s a line but it has arrows at both ends something what is this it never ends it never ends
right what do you call this where there s an ending sorry there s a beginning i said that backwards no ending that a ray this is a ray correct
this if there s an ending and there is a beginning what do you this right yeah you know it s weird every now and then you see that just called a point
i do not know if that s correct or not but i have seen that on assignments more so than any kind of test you re given circle but it s kind of like right angle square corner it quickly now what s this
correct what do you call a line that well here i ll go to this cuts the circle in half diameter diameter and then finally a line that cuts all the way through the circle but doesn t cut it in half cord cord questions on all these on the test easy guys this test it really isn t that hard
i m going to warn you though the next 2 chapters that we do starting with what i m going to show you today tended to trip kids up last year i m hoping what we re going to do today will help that a little bit
see but these next 2 chapters guys were probably the toughest last year than any other 2 chapters the entire year quick when s the test when s the test
tomorrow tomorrow let s do this those guys i need you to get into 7 groups
let s try and have most of the groups have 3 groups of 3 and a couple of the groups are going to need 4
you go back and join them back there guys here s what i need you to do now you and your partners i don t normally use these things but they work for this this is called a snap cube and guys the reason it s called a snap cube is because you re going to see this later if you haven t worked with these before
you can snap them in and snap them off from the other cubes one you and your partners decide how many of these snap cubes would be needed to fill whatever box you have in front of you
now but just write down how many of these do you think would be needed to fill up that box you have in front of you yourselves see if you can make a good guess here is the cube up how many of these do you think it would take to fill up that box
to the tip top to the tip top and fill every speck of space in that box guys just you and your group members take your best guess
if it s better you can join this group right here
otherwise move your chair and just sit there so you re not on the outside of the group
guys i do not know if that helps you because we re measuring by cubes
see guys one thing i should have mentioned will you go ahead and circle this number you wrote down whatever your guess was and will you just write it by it 1st and what that 1st means is 1st guess easy again just circle the number you made your guess because i think your guess will change as we go through this but let s just hear what each group came up with
front they had one of the bigger boxes at least by height a triscuit box girls how many cubes did you guess here s a cube 65 back here these ladies had this box 30 30 cubes they said to fill this up
now remember that would be to fill this thing up here all up to the top so every space you back here these ladies had this box 25 25 they guessed the guys back here had a small cereal box 14 they guessed 14 of the cubes okay guys where s your box
53 the guys over here had this box right here and they guessed 53 cubes is what they thought then finally the 2 groups up here this group girls are you with me here this group had this box 48 they guessed 48 cubes for this
then finally our last group had this box which is similar to what the girls had over there only it looks like it s a tad bigger okay the next thing i m going to give you i m going to give your group 5 of these cubes to measure with and let s see if that changes your guess in any way
so i m going to give you 5 cubes and you re going to use these to possibly i guess keep your guess the same or maybe change things go ahead
box the answer would be no because you re trying to be as exact as possible so if this group stacked their cubes and the cubes were this high the box isn t that high so you can only go up till you ve filled the box okay
sense okay take that into account that it wasn t quite at the very top
so if your group hasn t try and speed up the process a little bit
it was kind of a boring game though it really was it was sloppy and the refs were bad
good did you see that ridiculous call yes
okay it sounds like guys it sounds like most of the groups have made a guess and i noticed just without spending much time at any one group i noticed that a lot of the predictions changed from when you saw one cube to when you had 5 to work with
up here the 1st guess these girls had was 165 cubes sorry they 1st guess they had was 65 cubes 85 so their guess increased when they were measuring with the 5 cubes
back here what was your 1st guess 30 56 so that s 2 groups in a row where their prediction increased with the 5 cubes
49 an unusual guess but good enough so again they increased 14 guys what was your 2nd guess 30
30 so they more than doubled their original guess guys right here their 1st guess was what 53 53 and what was your 2nd 96 96 so far every group has increased this group their 1st guess was 56 right huh what was your 2nd 96
96 and finally this group right here had a 1st guess of 72 right the next step in this guys listen listening when that happens we never ever ever do things right not once so listen
listen the next step in this is teacher h who gave me most of these cubes was nice enough to put these things in these bags for us so i m going to give each group at least one of these some of you possibly 2 if that is not enough and your group needs more cubes that s fine
what you can do is either come up here and get another bag or next to those guys there in that corner there s just a box of these things
so you have access to more if you need them
so tray and fill your whole box with cubes
well try it again but remember guys i see your taking apart the cubes put the cubes back in the box cause i m going to have you take those out and show the group so make sure you have those on hand ready to roll
guys you re starting to run out of time
faster guys are we helping them yeah how i m building it do they know that do how does that help if you just cut them off and put that in all right hold on a minute
this you can t just throw the cubes in and get an exact answer look at what he s tried to do he s tried to build this and put this in it fits perfectly does it fit perfectly it needs some more now the problem you ve run into is what fit so what would you have to do
possibly but for right now why don t we try and fill this as best we can by making i do not know by making this was yeah 12 high and 4 across 12 high and 4 across is what he did that listen see how many of these you need to fill that in
guys keep doing that and i ll call on you last okay and give you more time here i know we have some groups still finishing up
if your group is still finishing and guys back there we re done with that stuff for right now if your group is still finishing up then just keep going if i see you working i ll try to leave you alone have you finished yet yes has any group finished yet besides back there and up here okay let s take a look guys at the group up here
again now stop what you re doing for a 2nd guys guys this group is saying they are finished only just glancing at this i see a problem
girls you needed to fill every inch of space in this box every speck of space hey what s the problem they have they have an extra space that you have more space here
it would expand the box the problem they re saying they have and i know they re not the only group give me a cube will you please is that if you put in extra cubes what happens fit now this is something guys i wondered if you would have an idea on how to solve this problem
do or in other words i guess maybe a better way to put that is what would you have to do in order to fix that problem it make it flatter huh make it flatter he s saying make it flatter possibly if there was a way to flatten this out and then you could lay them in that s one thing
thing split it in half if there was a way to break this either in half or break it into fourths you could do that so if this is you and looking around the room i think this is most of the groups including guys you back there you did not fill in your box all the way estimating this group has got to figure out okay we ve got this box
we ve got this box almost filled in all the way but the key word there guys is almost so what they ve got to figure out is okay if we could cut this box up sorry not box cube up how would that change
that talk amongst yourselves how you can do that guys that does include you in this group so stop making the figures and try and figure that out then there s this part right here
side yeah how many rows there are okay well then you could maybe just take out one section up you could do this but that looks like that would be kind of hard i would suggest you just take it lay it down and just take out one section
see what i m doing yeah and then that would help you i m glad you got the clock back on the wall good
glad did you fill every speck of space 35 how did you figure out what needed to be added in that s half of a cube though that s 10
so if you cut the one cube in half then you can fit it in there and 10 cut in half is 5 okay how did you know that you had 10 halves there s 5 in here and there s 2 sets of 5
5 i don t see where you re saying there s 5 in there cause there s 3 here 3 here and then 2 going this way i know but there s 5 going down okay gotcha 5 so you re saying that would be like putting 10 cubes and slicing them in half my question though is would slicing them in half work because look from here well maybe it would
so you re saying that measures out to about half a cube okay good 35 what was your last guess 30
close all right guys groups just stop what you re doing time so what i need you to do is just sit down listen
stop i need you to put it down we don t have a kindergarten class last i checked guys i just need you to look follow with me did one problem this group ran into is they at one point trust me they did had this hole with cubes the problem they ran into was they were saying okay
we can see how many go this way and then they couldn t remember how high it went on the sides so they are in the process of recounting that was maybe something i do not know if this problem happened to some of the other groups as well
i was watching the group of and what they were doing 1st they were just throwing cubes in the box that because they re right eventually they would have been able to fill the box
that you can t really count them yeah it s very hard to count how many you have not only how many cubes are in there but like the girls up here trying to figure out how many do i have going down
across how high is it you kind of need to know those 3 things and if you re just throwing cubes in and saying it s full the problem you run into is you re not going to know how many cubes are in the thing all right girls do you have an estimate about how many
200 they are saying they have about 200 cubes in there difference they had 85 and now they re up in the 200 range
good girls back here they have done a really nice job guys take a look of filling this almost if we re going to be picky i do not know how well i can show you without these toppling over but there is about a spot that big roughly where they haven t quite reached the top
remember we re filling every speck of space and every speck of space is every speck of space right 64 what was your 2nd guess 56 56 so they were fairly close what could they do guys and we re being picky with this
what could they do to fill up that little bit of space to the brim or at least how could they think i think some of the groups one of the groups guys i told them hey you ve got to fill it up to the brim and you didn t quite do that and they sort of looked at me like what how would you explain to them how could they just go about thinking about how this could be filled somebody raise their hand with an idea
cubes into fractions daniel is saying look you re going to have to cut up the cube now it s a shame we don t have a cube cutting machine i do not know if they even have those but if we did and they could cut up the cube and guys i know you ve seen this before how many of you remember those area problems like when you were in 3rd and 4th grade
they would give you like a rectangle and they would say 0 this side is 12 inches and this side is 6.35 inches how do you find area again
do you have to multiply you have to multiply length times width right guys can you multiply length times width and figure out how many cubes you had in the box let s take the girls up here
here could i just pull out the bottom part which would look something like this part if i just multiply length times width is that going to tell me how many cubes are in the box
no no because guys they had a stack of at least 3 of these things so just doing length times width is not going to tell me how many cubes are in here what else would i need to know i do not know why i put this stupid marker hold on for a 2nd let s say guys that my box was like this
these i knew this wouldn t cooperate
right i d need to know width then what else would i need to know for height height if i multiply those 3 numbers together would that give me my total yes try and do that now with your group
width see what happens when you multiply those 3 things together ahead don t go ahead do would you please put your cubes back in your bags if you have your cubes girls listen
if you have your cubes in your box just leave them in there then when you set your boxes back there any cubes you have left over let s put those in bags and then you can put the bags up here
all right boys and girls we are going to get started on our division lesson today so yesterday we worked through some problems as you will remember that were pretty tricky yes yeah those division problems were pretty tricky so today we are going to be practicing some of our strategies again we are going to do our workshop today so you will be working at different centers throughout the classroom
we are going to start off today with a little bit of a review and some discussion about how to solve these division problems
board i like how you are raising your hand quietly
missus santos owns a and she has 56 apples to arrange in rows for her window display she has room for 4 rows in her window stop right there minute i want you to close your eyes and imagine missus store does everyone know what a window display is
no so a window display is when they have a big window and they want to display like mannequins might be in there and they want to display their goods 56 and she wants them to put them in how many 0 how much room does she have
window i am picturing 4 rows ready to put our apples in now someone read me the question that we are going to solve today a how many apples will be put in each row if she puts the same number in each row excellent someone give me an equation that would help us solve this problem
then it reminded me of our last problem with the dog i wanted to make sure i put the same number in each row i do not want to have one row with 10 and another row with 8 equal so how many apples would she put in each row
4 56 divided into 4 so i am going to use this notation today to write that 56 divided by 4 what does the 56 stand for again everybody apples apples what does the 4 stand for rows rows we are missing what number
the answer we are missing the answer but what are we looking for here the quotient the quotient good memory for the apples in each row raise your hand g apples in each row i am going to put that question mark there
row so you made me remember last week when i taught you this notation i said that this notation reminds me of what an array an array so let us imagine i have an array card and on one side i see the number 56 in the middle
in an array we know that dimensions show us how many rows and how many columns so i am going to imagine there are 4 rows heads probably not because is this one of our times tables
hand 4 times 13 12 4 times 12 which we know is 48 48 so we know that this number is higher than 48 48 apples higher than 48
12 you know what i am going to wait we are not going to go through and solve this problem today cause this is actually one of the problems in your work from yesterday but i could say 4 times something equals 56
number we are missing one of our factors we are missing know what i am going to wait til i can hear that everybody is paying attention c we have a missing factor in our factor pair
factor well today we are going to play a game if you look at our objectives called what raise your hand a play missing factors with a partner play missing the factors dun dun dun just like this one with a partner
g solve division problems using 2 arrays pictures or equations excellent so you are going to be playing a game called missing factors and you are also going to be solving some division problems using of course if you need the cubes if you want to use arrays if you want to use pictures or equations
well i think it is important that we play a round of missing factors ourselves before i send you off to play it so i am going to need a volunteer and i am going to need to make a little semi circle here so that i can demonstrate how to play this here since you are sitting right in front of me why do not you be my partner so missing factors
now i have already put the directions out on the tables that we will be playing at everybody will be playing this game today so it is super important even those of you on the outskirts that you can listen and see how to play this game today
one so for missing factors what you will have you will have a set of directions on one side although if you pay attention now you might not even need to look at the directions sheet this is where you will be recording some of your equations you will also need a set of array cards array cards okay tell me what step one is
spread out all the array cards in front of you with the product side showing that someone so let us take this one i have a side that says 6 by 7 7 times 6 then i have another side that says 42 and it has one factor on it
7 which side has the product side of that the side that shows the answer which one is that product the product side up
this i notice it is missing a factor it is missing a factor what factor is it missing 66 so on these array cards when you look at them you can see there is a 421 of the sides will be labeled with the dimension
the other factor is missing that is why this game is called missing factors your job today your goal is to find out what that missing factor is a why does it have a missing factor why does it have a missing factor well it has a missing factor so that you can play this lovely game and try to figure out what the factor is
so if you see that the product is 42 and one of the factors is 7 if you know your 7s tables 7 times what equals 421 i have the answer 12 as my product
factor one because 12 times one is 12 also 12 divided by one is 12
right we will just lay a couple of them that product side up given your job is to say what the other dimension is direction this is the missing factor
for example if you choose an array card that has a total of 16 and one dimension is 2 the missing factor is 8 okay now it is really important that you guys are watching cause i do not want to see any cheating when it is your turn i want you to pick the card up cause guess what
side so you can not do that so i am going to start with a somewhat easy 11 now for those of you who can not see i will hold it up for you it is 20 is the product
what i am demonstrating how to play this game factor well i see 20 is the product 2 is one of the dimensions i know that 2 times 10 is 20 so the missing factor is 10
10 then what do i do once i have done that turn the card over to check your answer if you get am i right yeah is 2 times 10 20
factor keep going turn the card over to check your answer if your answer is correct keep the card you know what i if your answer is not correct return the card to the set of array cards back card now this is the last step and i am going to demonstrate this on the board as reads it to you
j on the missing factor reading sheet recording sheet sheet recording sheet write 2 equations one multiplication equation and one division equation you have to write 2 equations one of them will be multiplication what would be the multiplication problem for the card i used
10 10 equals 20 now has not read this part yet but you will circle the missing factor so 10 was my missing factor so i would circle that i am also going to write a division equation
does anyone think they might know the division equation for this again 40 divided into 2 groups 40 no how can i use these 3 numbers to write a division equation
c so 20 divided by 10
10 10 equals 2 hand 20 divided by 2 equals 10
i hope you are paying attention is that clear no say that again you could erase this anyway you could erase this and then put that right there but is 20 divided by 2 20
for there for there yes this is my multiplication equation equations my division my division equations
cards tell us what you see on it 11 the dimension is 11 and the answer the product is 22
no you do not i can not see does anyone know what the missing factor is 2 so he would circle that 2 times 11 is 22
11 equals 2 i would circle the missing factor right if points to one and he does not know it he just leaves it in the pile
okay if he gets the answer wrong he leaves it in the pile cause he is going to have to learn that one right so your goal again today is to play missing factors with a partner and to solve division problems using cubes arrays pictures or equations
any questions all right one thing before we get started please do not leave the rug this way because of the video camera okay all right the 1st group to go will be group one and and at the zebras table
go ahead the 2nd group to go and and at the tigers table ahead group 3 and at the penguins table
teacher 4th group table j the last group 5 at my table and and group 6 will be at the giraffes and
can you take the array cards to their table please join this lady is group sorry i knew i was missing one name c this group i knew i was missing one girl i hope you did not come empty handed we are going to work on some division problems today
okay so i want you to read through the 1st problem and think about how you would solve it yourself as i make sure that everybody is getting started here right you can talk to each other and get cubes if you need them
hi i am going to look to see that you guys are getting started started can i read the directions do we need to read the directions no these are yours i do not know i want to read it i got one okay do we have pencils
i got one that is mine give me the scissors teacher l maybe you could get this group started and make sure that is paying attention okay girls what will i see if i know you are getting ready
c thank you you so you and will play and you 2 will play
these how many array cards do we need you can just spread out a handful whatever will fit and when you need more you can put more out okay
i did not figure it out yet all right 84 divided by you know it is 84 divided by 7
let us write that down let us write the equation down to start with here tell me what this stands for
i am curious what you are doing these are chairs meeting there are 7 chairs in each row
how many rows of chairs are there for but i thought there were 7 chairs in each row
no you are supposed to try to put them all in that spot i know it is small good question let me go get a white how did i not bring my whiteboard over here
c what does that 12 really stand for
84 what does the 7 stand for chairs in each row 7 so i know that 84 divided by 7 we are missing a number here right what i am missing is how many rows of 7
so if i think of it this way it is like 7 times something should get me to 84 that is how many rows 12 12 times 7 is 84
84 so did you need to draw your picture it is okay there is not a picture but i am not sure your picture matches the problem if you were to draw a picture it might look more like this there is a row draw how many rows do i need
12 right if i drew 12 of these rows i would get 84 chairs does that make sense one let us see if you do not even need the picture to help you okay
all right so what is our strategy today them who can tell me what is 7 times 12 are you guessing 7 times 12 is 84
12 what do we have going on here what does this stand for the rows for chairs so what was your strategy with 7 7 like a row of 7
7s how do you know when you are finished how do you know when you have reached 84 know do you know what 7 times 10 is
10 that is 70 chairs
84 so you really could have done drew on this with okay that is fine you really could have done if you thought about it your thinking 7 times something should get you to 84
sense now if you know 7 times 10 gets you to 70 7 times 11 gets you to 77 7 times 12 gets you to 84
84 see if you can draw some equations to represent your thinking on there
t 6 times miss santiago had 90 packages of candles keep reading the candles came in packages of 6 how many packages of candles does she have i notice this time you wrote a multiplication problem so what are you thinking there explain it to me
packages of 6 okay so you know what if you can hear me clap twice it is getting pretty noisy in here
voices i want to remind you to synergize with your partner i want to remind you that you have about 4 minutes before we are going to rotate
i want to see some synergy at is table again the candles come in packages of 6
so the 6 stands for what the candles come in 6 they came in 6 packages what is a package of 6 so a package of 6 is a package of 6 whats candles so the 6 stands for candles candles
missing how many how many candles say that again what is it that we are missing if i know that here is a package of candles there is my 6 candles there is the package
for she has 90 packages
0 my goodness we made a mistake she had 90 candles candles come in packages of 6 how many packages of candles does she have sense 0 my goodness i am going to need to cross that out
i would like to do it she had 90 candles okay that might make more sense one 90 divided i am just going to write down what you are doing tell me the 1st thing you wrote down
90 divided by 6 you so here is a package of candles 6 6 6 12 or do we know a high what is the highest 6 table you know 11 11 so i am going to rewrite this as 6 times something equals 90
6 times 11 equals so one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
72 so think about how you would represent this with like you did with this one that all right if you can hear me clap twice snap once it is still way too noisy in here and it is time to rotate
if you are at a missing factors table you may leave the array cards where they are and you will rotate to the next table time no group will rotate to me
table this group you are rotating to the giraffes no table way we always rotate this way
so you would go to the zebras table have a okay sit across from your partner please
paper let us organize these array cards 1st why do not you each put a set out in front of you put these aside with your name on it i need another paper you know what there are plenty of papers
turn it around why do not we have a recording sheet it is on the back of the directions out said turn it on this sheet no all right once you have your stuff organized your sheets are right here
how many are we supposed to take out you can just lay out a couple t here is a recording sheet for you
you have one okay can you not sit in this chair right now
table i need to see some synergy here scoot your chair over please on that table show him how to do it
minute you know what s t 0 p stop noisy you are all using yelling voices indoor voices mean only the person next to you should be able to hear you
i need to see some synergy working you know what
you are not focused right now you know what that is not my name you called me now synergizing so what would i see that is not an indoor voice okay stop these are not indoor voices
i should not have to say it again go okay if i saw you synergizing i would see you 2 sitting a little closer
i would see you reading this carefully and discussing how to solve it okay jill bought a bag of 50 beads to make a keychain she uses 6 beads for each key you do not know 7 times 12
how many keychains can she make she says she do not like going to a higher number so you know 7 times 10 11 what is 7 times 12 anyway so let us see if you can get there
7 times 11 is do we write the same ones as they get this group is not doing the right thing because i see that these are not flipped onto the right side
okay i do not see anyone synergizing with a partner so i 1st i am pointing to this one
c i am going to see that the product is 45 d 89 i agree with you 9 so i would write 5 times 9 is 45 wait i do not see division problems here too then i would take this and move it aside
you have to talk with him you 2 need to say who is turn is it has go ahead you have to wait your turn go ahead do not pick it up
it what is the product product no you tell him that is what i said what is the product that is what i meant no you tell him 80 you are supposed to be telling this
the product is so if it is your turn and you wanted this card you would go the product is 80 loud then you would say did i get it right you did so now you can record it
then talk to the product is 96 is 8 8 what is the missing factor you have to make a guess
is what might be this long 96 12
you are right 8 times 12 is 96 turn okay she is not your partner
partner did you read the problem about you know what i have noticed that you 2 are on different sides of this paper
please which side are we going to go on it read it to
72 plus what equals 90 so if i had a 8 then that would be 80 +10 so i need she used 6 beads for each keychain how many keychains can she make i do not know this timetable what do you think
picture what would your picture get a pen out of the you can not just say i do not know you have to use some strategies
so one strategy might be to either get cubes or to draw a picture here i will go get the cubes there are some cubes on my table so take the ones that are in sets already say that again you can do it that way that is fine
i know there is not a lot of room there okay another thing that we are missing 2 equations for each one you should have 2 equations for each one you know what i will have to write down what i see going on here and it is not all good
hard i am working hard so are you helping him wrong if he were my partner i would be telling him that tell him
what so i am going to watch to see how you are going to recover right now and do the right thing both of you
wow some you know what i am going to wait but i would really like to see that you know how to work with a partner one you are going to talk to him
stop you know what stop take that hat off right now
together so we are going to stop because this is a waste of time unless we can work together i need to see right now that you can clean up your cards we are going to discuss what partnerships will look like on the rug quietly i want to see the cards and cubes picked up
i want to see that you have your 2 sheets and that you are not being careless you you are checking for pencils and books go now i said quietly
a i should see you cleaning up d do i see you cleaning up then go help clean up the cubes on the back table organize the papers that are left out please
together the 4 of you have done an excellent job paper i am proud of you today i like how and were working hard together nice job
math clean this up please excuse me boys in the library out of there please you know what
partner you know what those people who were at the tigers table i see a chair sack on the ground
place all right
i am just very curious if there is a partnership who really thinks they were synergizing okay why do you think you were synergizing
other she wanted to do 7 times 12 and i wanted to do 7 times 11
but i told her i would like to do my high numbers she decided to do 7 times 11 it did each of you have to solve it the same way
that but if wants to use her own strategy she could do it and if you want to use your own that is okay but what i saw these girls doing here is they were talking to each other about the math that they were working together they were reading the problem together and that is what a good synergizing partnership would look like
who thinks they could model for us with their partner how to play missing factors you know what i am going to write who thinks they can model for the entire class how to play this game correctly i would not pick you guys cause i am not sure that you were all synergizing
so i would agree no i am sorry when i looked over i did not see synergy at that table synergy could you 2 switch seats with and there could you bring the array cards over please please you have some
attention what do you notice as they play so i will know you are paying attention when your eyes are on and like is like is looking
to i like how is standing up
you boys do not need to see
agree yes i agree okay s t 0 p stop no were they addressing each other
yeah were they talking to each other no well could play this game without why what was she doing with and what was using for
i mean if i were playing this game by myself i probably would play it very differently than the 2 of them were just playing notice was correcting if the factors were right how did she know what she was choosing what did do to let know which card she was choosing
she said something divided by something equals something she said out loud i am choosing this card she then said an equation this writing them down other not saying anything out loud
you are supposed to be using your partner to check to see if you are right you know what i am noticing who was doing this and who was not
i am sure teacher l was as well so we can not do group work and games if you can not talk to each other nicely if you can not use each other and work with each other it is like work and play it is like our theme work and play
play we can play a game but it is also work and it is learning workshop how many people feel like they met the objective of playing factor pairs with a partner
see you would see where is your evidence today that you met that objective what would i see the sheet what would i see on your recording sheet work the directions raise your hand
p you do not know me just one equation p thank you
equations i should see more than just 2 rows filled out probably except for that last group who got cut short what evidence would i see to see that you met objective number 2 solving division problems j working with your partner no what am i going to look for tonight when i go to see if you met my objective or not
k that you drew a picture and answered it no you need to answer the questions who honestly thinks they met the objectives today on both now look at what i will see when i look at it
see our work finished i want you thinking about that today and you should be thinking about that every day know who honestly thinks that there is evidence that they learned today
2 people i agree with some of you that there might not be evidence that you learned today in please make sure your name is on it as you leave the rug you should have 2 pieces of evidence today i would like you to hand it to teacher l
i would like you to go to your seat and take out a book and read as we get ready for social studies please do not push and shove wait your turn please where do i put this is it an extra it your mom sent me a message that you have something for me in your backpack
here okay we already discussed a little bit but i want to start today s math lesson reviewing from yesterday
review and then you re going to be working more on the same exploring of things from yesterday hold that right there so we showed yesterday we were working on page 7 and 8 does everyone have in front of no
don t i have a couple extra copies i don t now if you look would you put this up there for me please please turn please look to number 2 on that page please look to number 2 on that page
we started yesterday showing how i see i know i m not going to have us bring chairs up to the rug but i want you to turn i want you to please turn your chairs so you re looking up to the front okay we started yesterday s group found the same answer but they did it 2 different ways
does anybody recall or can you tell us what did you have to start layer and what was on that layer layer they had 25s
so this is that what you re saying 5 so that means this layer 2 groups of 5 is also 2 times 51010 so if i draw like a sideways representation
it was 2 times 5 on the bottom layer and then what happened next up no put the tape down quietly layers when you added 2 more layers you weren t adding just 2 more cubes
what happened 2 more what 2 more 5s this is 25s 2 groups of 5 no i think we re saying there s not just 25s there s 2 groups of 52 times
so summarize what just happened she had only 5 groups of 2 and then she turned it into the she wound up turning it into so you re saying that groups of 6
happens 5 groups of 65 groups of 6 which is another related factor d because i know that s 35 times 6 is 30 so the volume is 30
by the way what how would you explain the word volume mean because actually one or 2 kids weren t here this week a couple of days j can i say something 1st
right and also because he said 5 times 6 or he could have said 2 +2 equals 246 that so then that s 6
one then it goes to 30 and the volume is like what s the number that like it equals word cubes or sometimes people say cubic units and we put this up on the little word as cube cubic unit
know units there s you put units and next to the . next to the units you put a small 3 to the 3rd power cubed but we re going to talk about number 3 after
quick and i m going to stop and i m going to put i need a black marker i need to put one minute up for our recess time because i hear 2 kids touching tape and i see one kid cutting something right now one touching tape nope okay that wasn t put that down please you already asked me for it
now the same the same same problem did this another way she instead of doing layers she had columns not rows
units to the 3rd power and that connects to what s group said yesterday what number was your table looking at here s our 10 groups of 3 by 4 by 3 ah
so yours was different what number 336 number 3 and what are the 3 numbers 3 by 4 by 33 by 4 by 4 by 3 ah
so this connects this connects to your objective today boys and girls i want . our job today your job today is to determine the volume of rectangular prisms which is up there
your language objective what i want to see you do is i want you to use numbers to prove your strategy works i want you to explain why your strategy works and how it could work every time like layers but i also have this question about why 3 factors why do you think there s 3 factors so s group started yesterday and everyone has this
3 it says 3 by 4 by 3 so they actually use the word by instead of times 3 how can you figure out what a cube looks like with just numbers with decide which 3s do you want to come up and show us
3s if you want to if you want to draw what you started with come on up and thank you math we want to hear what your thinking was
this i started with i 1st because i did my 1st answer 1st i did my 3 times the 4 yep right and i knew that was 12 12 times 3 is 36
so that was my 1st answer 36 was my 1st answer so you know there s going to be 36 cubes you re saying and then i saw you guys tracing something your team traced i know it won t be exact because there s no squares that let me put this this is what they traced
and this connects to what was saying to do now this morning something there s something about that ah so i see your dimensions up there
4 boys and girls where do you think s thinking was to put the 3 and the where did he get the 3 and the 4 from k where do you think well i have a question for you
see he s making an array it was wrong because it was because we didn t know the 3 was well you re not wrong because it connects to the problems but you know there s something about that 3rd number
the 3 so is that what you re saying or is you did the 3 and the 4 but you know you have to think about this other number the 3 look so what this is on one of our questions test factors 3 by 4 by 3 else what are you thinking
i guess it needs to be so the 3 times 4 is one of the dimensions that equals 12 +3 layers times 3 so can you hear that from way over there said could you begin to say because this is really important about what you said
say the 1st few things you said about the 3 by 4 and the layer 3 by 4 is just the dimensions of the area that times 12 +3 so you re saying that 3 by 4 is just one layer just like the one did was a 2 by 5 on one layers yeah ah
awesome all right so boys and girls i m going to stop i don t want to do all the talking you re going to work your objective is to determine the volume of the rectangular prisms on 3 and 4 prove that you know them with numbers adding you can make a picture to show what s going on if you re finished i have a challenge for a couple students to create a certain type of box
work we re going to work for about 15 to 20 minutes then we re going to try to talk and summarize what are these things we ve discovered we have layers we have 3 factors we can make columns sometimes so go ahead with the materials person i know the groups might be a little different today so you have to sort of manage materials
10
i thought about eyes
because i don t have all eyes up here
it s so unfair that some kids are doing that
i don t have all eyes i every friday now i wasn t clear enough because i see some kids that are kind of half working objective i should have written on all the problems on page 7 and 8 you have to finish that those 2 pages and show how you know the volume so take ownership and leadership of it and get working on it
task 0 yeah to turn the light back up around the one materials person gets the stuff and we continue
i don t want to have the discussion some of the things we ve discovered because some real issues came up with these i m seeing some kids i m going to add time because i see some kids who are not focusing on the objective the whole time that at the end of this week i want to really bring back together what we ve discovered
i think one minute is very fair to have group the materials person puts all things back and be back at seats up to be discussed what we have go ahead please it s time
you should be by the time the timer goes off
i guess maybe i m being really unfair about expectations maybe that s my fault but i m expecting you to beat not when the timer goes off i don t want you to this timer doesn t stop ready maybe that s my fault for not explaining it clear enough but this is important in this math
girls so please turn up 4 some really important ideas came up on number 4
36 i heard 48724 and 1441 group noticed i believe these are all factors of 12 me 12 is a factor of all these numbers these are all these are all multiples of 12
tricky when you have your paper you can t see the whole you can t see the whole thing you can t see the whole thing so can you now i m talk boys and girls i want to hear i think this should be fair
shh i want to hear 5 comments about other kids thinking so when says something i want to hear someone commenting about what he was thinking off you guys have different colors but this is someone used black and white for the same one
4 can you come up and tell us what you saw layers of 6 what do you see that made you say that because i see like the 4 and then the 2 because so i knew it would be 4 times 2 and it would be 6 on each on each on each layer of 6 on each layer of okay go ahead paraphrase what he said
or summarize or agree why agree the summary i think 48 is yeah 48 i think we have 48 because like you built the model and you put them in
there s 6 layers and then there s 8 in each 8 times 6 equals 4848 okay you said this 1st so there s one comment now what did you and saw different layers
us the 2 of you come up can you show us what you can you tell us i said that there was 24 on each side so you did 0 that s what does she mean
because 24 +8 is so 78 it s really 8 times 3 so a group of 24 go ahead what does she see that made you say 24 you started talking about what is 4 times 6
4 times 2 equals 8 okay so 2 groups go down so she caught . if she caught a line down you could see 2 groups wait there s one more how did you see it
i took 9 and you see one side well i saw that one bottom inside so 4 times 3 is 8 and in each layer there would be 8 48
okay so i don t think i could ask this i m doing a bad job of this i m doing a bad job of this game of discussion on this j i agree with the 12 count because you get 12 in the whole thing 120 what did you mean
i m sorry like i agree with the 12 count like the counting and like yeah 24 times 2 equals 484 times equals also 12 times 4
and 8 times 3 i want to end with this boys and girls how would we name this if we said there are because there s something about 3 numbers how would we name this this would everyone for 30 seconds talk to the kid next to you
numbers turn and talk
cool i so they know the total is 48 now one kid said the answer would have to be this is a one times one times 48 another kid said another kid said what did you say i said let me show you how i wrote it
say i want to discuss this 12 times 2 times 212 times 2 times 22 and one i put the apostrophes between the 2 times 2
on i want to end with this take a look up take chart everyone look up at the chart please all of these one
these 12345 answers and there could be more 48 but but there is is that is true all of these make 48 but only one of these is the actual dimensions of this
i know the answer okay
we are going to would you stop talking people at the back lesson now we have been looking at decimals percentage percents and fractions and how are these math terms common
we have percents fractions and decimals how are these 3 what these 3 concepts have in common s they are all part of a 100 they are all part of a
whole a percentage is a fractional part of a whole whole a decimal is a part of a whole now we have done we have looked at adding and subtracting decimals adding and subtracting fractions and finding percents of a whole now today we are going to go on to some other exercises
we are going to be looking at word problems that involve decimals right now 1st of all 1st of all let us do a 10 minute activity before we get into our lesson can you pass out these for me person thank you
you can pass these out please the people at the back
now while you are doing that i would like you to record 3 tenths 3 tenths on your hundredths chart shade in 3 tenths on your 100 charts
let me see you shade in 3 tenths on your 100 charts done so how many rows are we going to shade 33 that is 3 out of how many
13 out of 100 so each row is how many how many squares in 3 tenths okay so it is 10 rows in each row 10 squares in each row so that is 3 tenths
me 353535 over a 135 hundredths now shade that on your paper
shade 35 hundredths on your paper job so how many are we shading
35 how many so how many 3 tenths and 51s 3 tenths and 51s 3 tenths and 51s good that is 35 hundredths okay
right now on your sheet of paper we are going to the package that i gave you yours let me see yours have you shaded okay
job now so we all agree that a decimal is part of a whole did you shade all the squares no you do not shade you shaded a fractional part or a portion part of the whole right now i want you to look at your paper
17 and you are going to read with me a decimal everyone a decimal a fractional number place value decimals places are written to the right of a decimal point
so for example how would i write 35 as a decimal .35 okay so the numbers are to the right of the decimal okay now turn your page to turn to page 18
page 18 page 18 and i am going to call on individuals to read for me and then we will do the solutions for the problem
example the normal human body temperature is who can read that number for me k 98 and 698.66 degrees and what does the 10 represent there represent 10 how do we know that is 10
remember it is in the tenths place it is in the tenths place remember when you are doing these problems 1st of all what do you have you have maybe you have a whole number before if you have a whole number then the whole number comes before the decimal or after the decimal before before so you will have the whole number and then you will have your decimal
okay so 6 now after the decimal what comes next tenths it is tenths then you have hundredths and thousandths so it is always good to have this as an example to help you to identify the place value for each figure
right now so it says the normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees fahrenheit how is that number written in words
words 98 and 6 tenths 98 i am sorry
paper so it is 98.6 that would be written in words as 98 and what part of speech would be 90 here
speech what part 90 is describing 8 here so it would be an adjective okay we are making connections to reading 98 and 6 tenths 6 s i x 6 tenths tenths in number and in words
so we should be able at all times to write the decimal number in numbers and also in words okay now read number 2 read number 2 for me
shows this number in standard form c 2 caitlin walked 3 and 8 hundredths miles that is written the number is written in words now in standard form how would you write that and what did you choose
no it would be it is 3 okay this 3 and 8 hundredths miles
okay so they did what do you what letter did you choose number 333 and 8 hundredths so i am going to have my tenths this is going to be tenths hundredths and thousandths so how many
8 hundredths so there was did we have a number for did we have a no no so we add a 0 and the last figure here would be in the hundredths column so it will be 3 decimal 8 hundredths everybody sees that
okay now i want you to do number 3 number 4 and number 534 and 5 sit up yes okay this is a whole number the whole number is always before the decimal
decimal then you have tenths then you have hundredths then you have thousandths this is a whole number point thank you are you finished
working come on see what happened come on focus on your work
done okay take another minute k okay number 3 is for
a 75 miles per hour what number okay so she drove 63 decimal what
2525 what okay what number is in that tenths place what number is in the tenths place 2 what number is in the tenths place huh what number what number here is in the tenths place huh what number is in the tenths place 2
2 everybody agrees that 2 is in the tenths place because exactly after the decimal there is the tenths hundredths and thousandths so 2 is in the hundredths place job okay number 4 is for you
no starting number 4 why did you say d
because after the comes the thousandths after the hundredths comes the thousandths so the answer there would be d
right could i do number 5 number 5 certainly how is the number how is the number one decimal 2 everybody read this number for me
one and 205 thousandths now how is this written in words w one and 205 thousandths okay so did you choose c
so it would be one if you were asked to write this in words one this is a whole number one and and meaning that there is a decimal there there is part of a whole there one and 202055 what
thousandths thousandths we do not say 105 and one and 205 thousandths is this related to the lesson
6 what is 6 times 10 +4 times one +3 times 0 one +9 times point b see you want to come and show this on the overhead please paper that is a long one
b everybody agrees with b yes okay let us see in your paper 10 write out the problem and then you show us how write it bigger please
6060 +4 times one is equal to
now +plus put it here 9 times that is one hundredths so that 909 so what are we going to do now
now it equals 60 okay put it right here 6 times 10 is equal to 60 explain your work sweetie do not erase it just put the show us how you got the total 6 times 10 +4 times one equals 4 right that is the whole number yes
so 0 one this 3 times 13 times one is 3 right one so what do we have here in the tenths column
is 99 so the answer is read the answer everyone 64 and 39 hundredths 64 and 39 hundredths thank you right now what i want you to do turn to question 10
j you need to write how many thousandths and could you please write in words too words how many thousandths how many thousandths do not just write thousandths how many thousandths always
look not paying attention have nothing tenths then you have what
what 1000 thousandths so this is asking you what is the value of 3 in the number 22 now how do you classify this is this the whole number yeah so where do i put it
words show your answer in numbers and in words i think i i started to work on this one okay let me see yours okay how many thousandths how many
many all right now remember let us draw our table again so we have the what comes 1st
number the whole i am just going to write wn for whole number whole number then you have the decimal then you have tenths tenths then you have hundredths then you have thousandths pay attention stop writing
learn okay so what is the value of 3 in the number 22 where am i going to write the 22 the whole number whole number
33 so what is the value of 3 go ahead what did you write 3 thousandths 3 thousandths absolutely it is 3 thousandths we are going to write that in words as well as in numbers so 3 thousandths okay
s 3 thousandths here so yes 003003 in words and in numbers
that in words and in numbers do not just write thousandths how many sorry excuse me
up sit up and you need to be paying attention i am not concerned about that right now
okay now let us do another one see number 11 a yeah read it
again a bottled water company advertises its water as 99 and 88 thousandths percent pure what is this number written in words is it is 99 and read the number for me
see 99 right what is this word 00 i spelled it 80 continue over here just cross this out and continue there so that the people at the back can see
88 thousandths 88 thousandths 99 and 88 thousandths everybody sees that
okay now look at question 14 and that is for you own question 14
me the weight of an insect is less than one gram the weight has a 0 in the tenths place a one in the hundredths place and a 2 in the thousandths place what is the weight so will you come and show us how you recorded that
you okay come on here okay
again the weight of an insect the weight of an insect is less than one gram place 00 in the tenths place what else a one in the hundredths place one in the hundredths place place so what do we can we read this figure
everybody 24000 what grams grams right g r a m job is not it supposed to be grams it is not 100 yeah it is not more than one i should say it is just it is less than one so we will say gram
number 15 what is the value of 5 in read that number everyone one and 352 thousandths what is the value of 5
number 13521352 thousandths so what is the value of that 55 hundredths 5 hundredths and how could we write that that give me in words and in figures
on and come on okay put it right here
give me in words 5 thousandths 1st 5 thousandths 5 hundredths 05 hundredths i am sorry 5 hundredths and how would we write it
good now i want you to do number 16 that is the open response everybody please do the open response 16 the mean distance from earth to sun is 90 okay
everyone please read a figure for number 16 as a matter of fact everybody read the problem the mean distance in words so the 1st thing you are going to do is to write the number in words
then for part b what is the value of 6 in this number show or explain how you got your answer answer and then part c write the number in expanded notation
now begin working on question 16 come on
yeah can you tell me how read it for me
b come and do part a for me up quickly quickly okay answer 1st of all let us see the number number 92 decimal 96
words write it big so the people at the back can see no
look here 92 what is this what is this what is this is this a letter or a number that 92 what okay words okay so fix it and let me see it
s quickly quickly pay attention time yeah come on
yes okay now so this is part a b what is the value of 6 what is the value of 6 in this number what is the value of 6 what is the value of 6
n t h 0 no we are writing this in numbers 6 tell me how many 0 how do i start 00 decimal decimal 000066 is she correct yes definitely she is so what is the explanation
the problem says it says to explain as well okay the 6 is in so your explanation would be what d the 6 is where it is in the thousandths place okay
the 6 is in the thousandths place place so its value is
6 thousandths its value is 6 thousandths huh no i was just emphasizing something here
i was just showing that it is actually it is 10 hundredths and thousandths 10 hundredths and what thousandths thousandths good right now i want you to finish the rest of the exercises finish the rest of the exercises
those that you did not finish at the front of the paper double check your work please make sure everything is correct
e huh no
job i can see that you are increasing your understanding of decimal places back now for c write the number in expanded notation please note expanded notation expanded form expanded notation
part part c of 160 yes come on
work sit up
let me see the okay
up as you stand up you hand up please walk around and find your partner the person that s pretty much closest to you when i ring the bell
room when i ring the bell give you my signal you will pair up with the person who is closest to you drive by be courteous and cautious to the people that are in your space
the person who s closest to you i want you to high 5 that person and once you have your partner you can put your hand down with your partner
up if your hand is up now please find your partner closest to you that s fine okay come on this side for me please very good once you have your partner please find a seat next to your partner
partner i would like it best if you had a desk because the activity that you re going to need to be paired up with a partner and you re going to need your pencil good job and
partner where s your partner okay you 2 can sit in the back right behind right next to me where s my where s your partner
there once you have your partner give me a thumbs up look at me and smile your mouth is closed good now you can put your thumb down now the next thing we re going to do for the next 30 minutes you re going to rally someone tell me what it is to rally coach
a you get a piece of paper and your one partner would be partner a and one partner would be partner b and well partner a goes and asks the 1st question and if you get it wrong you get to help her like coach her okay good track so as we rally coach there will be a partner a and a partner b
for this exercise partner a will be the person who s name is closest to the 1st letter of the alphabet a partner b of course will be the other person who s name is not closes to the 1st letter of the alphabet paper once you have your paper you ll see partner a at the top
partner a i want you to write your name on the line that says partner a partner b i would like for you to put your name where it says partner b that that reason is because where it says partner a partner a will be working out problem number one for partner b now what is partner b doing while partner a is working on problem number one
yes coaching them close but something else partner a has now become the coach as i would like to call it a teacher a teacher partner a will facilitate and tell partner b how this problem is to be worked out
now what happens if partner a is stumbling over that question that they re working on during help them out very good out you don t just sit and watch partner a struggle right all right now so partner a is explaining how to complete or how to solve the problem for problem one
and then partner b s turn will do the same thing say while partner a is speaking partner b is listening when partner b is speaking partner a is listening and not only listening they are listening and learning right so what happens when you both stumble on a problem
do ask the teacher or ask the neighbor next to you i like your 1st answer you want to raise your hand and that s where i come in because i will be walking the room and monitoring your work okay minutes it is not i repeat it is not a race okay
the main objective is for students to be able to understand problems and to work out problems as a review okay all right any questions on this how many sheets of papers do how many sheets of paper will you receive 111 okay so when i give this rally coach page to you i want you to put your name on both sides where it says partner a and partner b
sides and then i will tell you which page you will start working on 1st you 2 are partners yes yes okay that s you might have to slide together somehow so that you can be shoulder partners turn and face your sit so your partner you re sitting near your partner
yes
okay on both sides yes put your name on both sides where if you re partner a . raise your hand by the way partner a
hand i see 2 hands raised back here are you partner a or partner b a good so partner a s writing his name on both sides or her name on both sides and partner b s writing his name on the side that says partner b
0 all right the side that we will start working on is the side that reads find the lcm can you find that page please
lcm all right you will start working together okay when i ringing the bell b and as i said i ll be coming around and monitoring what you re doing okay all right any questions
any questions all right begin i m coming over 2nd i m coming over i don t know what the l the m means but i know that the lc means okay
i know what here s a question for you as the timer is going what also what s a 2nd option that you can do or use to help you better understand 1st what do you have in your desk listen what do you have in your desk that you can use as a 2nd option for help 0
j your name tag yeah you can use your name tag for help because it has tools on your name tag yes a notebook yeah you can use your notebook and you can go back to the notes that you ve had 0 and your your reference book
desk now i will be coming around as i said but the reference book which is your hard book you can pull that out but i will still be coming around to help is this hard reference book it has everything you need need and as a partner working together 2 heads are better than one
you can flip into that reference book if you need some help with understanding as i come around if i don t get to you in time jump ahead and check into your reference book
now i hear someone say to me teacher t i m not quite sure about that lcm which was something that we worked on review someone real quick someone real quick tell me what does that acronym stand for
hint least common least common multiple multiple least common multiply multiple least common multiple going hands up you so . find the least common multiple of 5 is there anything you can multiply that will give you 5
no what . what multiple can you use 0 wait and well we normally don t use one but what s another one else 0 umm no 0 that would be 01 and what 2 that would be what would you multiply times one to get 5
yeah you want to write that the least common multiple for 21 and 24 just 0 . 22 what s the least common multiple for 4 ooh . . the least common multiple huh one and . one and 4 no
22 you also use 2 and 4 yes did you did huh okay let s go into . the glossary yes 6 you got to read the there we are the least common multiple the smallest number that is multiple is a multiple of is a multiple of 2 or more numbers
for example while some common multiples of 686 and 8 are 24 48 and 72 the least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24 all right so how can we connect this to that problem if we look at 5 what s the least common multiple that we can come up with
multiply 5 times one yeah but we always we don t always want to use that 12 and 42 and what well we would say 21 and 5 would be the only 2 but . that would give you 5 but what about 22 and 22 times 2 okay and what about 4
else 4 times 2 times 2 times 4 what s what times 2 times 3 what times what gives you 422 times 2 yeah 4 so 2 would be one
so 2 would be one so that would be put a 2 right here also and then . what about the 5
24 all right so what number can we multiply to get 55 times 15 times 11 and and what else one and 5 comma 5 all right what about that 4
one and then what else 2 times 22 times 2 put a 2 there so again it says the smallest number that is a multiple of 2 or more numbers
for example while some common multiples of 6 and 8 are 24 48 and 72 the least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24 so you need to look at how can they be how are they multiplied multiplied like 6 and 8 that s . that is 48
okay how can i put this to you here 6 times one is 0666 times 2 is 12126 times 3 is 15 okay and so forth
is 4 so what i want to see on that line is that you multiplied all the way up 0 give me answers right here and which one do they have in common
here i m coming over there no i don t need help i just i m coming over there on 2 times 5 is what what 1515 write 15 here 2 times . 4 is
202020 put 20 there 2 times 2 times 4 is not 20 what 3030 i m sorry 5 times 5 is what 2525 put 25 there okay and let s just stop is 4 put a 4 so all we re going is going by 510 15 20 25
not quite and then 2468 you want to multiply because we re trying to find our multiplies what 6 okay write 62 times 714 write it ahead 2 times 32 times 4 is what
there 2 times 55 is 10 okay do you see something in common going 2 times 6 is 2 times 6 is 12 okay we might have to write smaller
no so erase that 2 right there and erase that one there 4 times 288 put your 8 there
4 times . 3121212 times 416 right 16 times 5 i mean times yeah what 2020 times 5 times 5 yeah we did 16
48121620 now do you see anything in common 510152025 let s read the numbers 22468101214161820 we didn t keep going but it would have been 20
20 if we would have kept going you would have put a 20 right there and just circle it 20 what s the least common multiple 2020 do the same thing for 36 and 8 yes
okay put your head down for a minute all right let me say something real quick as the timer s going here question with lcm and then i m going to let you keep going but for those of you who are struggling with that real quick we have 5 shh we have 2 and we have 4
now when we re talking about the lcm we re talking about the least common multiple me when you see multiple you should think of multiply as a hint right quick everybody 5 times one
2105 times 320155 times 420 keep up
a what do they have in common what s the least common multiple of this of 52 and 420 okay the next one you do just like that don t understand all right so now we re putting these fractions in order now it would be good to use illustrations for this
if you have 3 eighths show me how 3 eighths would look in a from least to greatest show me how it would look in a pie and do the same thing for 4 fifths and for 2 fourths help me with this and then i ll come back to you
a whole and 13rd so teacher j we done no we not we done shh
shh this is already are you explaining what you re doing every time i talk i m let s be nice
doing okay let s stay focused tell me what you re doing for this problem well i m putting all my multiples of 85 and 4 and then putting these fractions in order based on the numbers down here okay
this if you were to make a pie using 3 eighths 4 fifths and 2 fourths how would that look could i give you a piece of paper and you show me
you 3 pies the 1st one i want you make shade in 3 eighths the 2nd one shade in 4 fifths and the 2nd the 3rd one shade in 2 fourths 6 times wait until she s done with this and then it will be your turn
i ll come back around finished okay explain to me what you did here right here did this one he got to explain that i no no no explain because what are you supposed to be doing right now
a you will do your part when she s finished explaining how she came up with 5 to do this and then when she s done i can explain to her why her that s the it looks like that s the you know the . the purpose of rally coach
so how did i come up with number no that s right okay explain because we re trying to put these fractions in order order 388 well how do i put these in order i ll come back i can explain my answer okay
i did what i did was i was if a then like in a pie formation like if you . if you have . if you take 4 sixths of a pie you have 2 left and basically my leftovers okay
here and that s all i did did anyone look at the bottom number i did okay what i want you to do next is i want you to pull out a reference book you have a reference book like . the . the hard book
and i want you to look up . fractions equivalent fractions i m coming yes away it s a mess over here let s focus
can we focus please hold on okay i don t have one have what have a reference book the what a reference book okay i ll bring one to you i got all right you should have a pencil and you should be facing this way
we better use a pencil we ll switch off cause each one has one time to explain correct problem okay 3 times one is that to do with these 3 okay you need to know it here don t make it so big
26 hold on 12nd turn 3 times 2 put it there 3 times 39 put the next one
number okay 3 times 412 okay don t make it so big 53 times 5
again if 3 times 4 is 12 then . 3 more would be 15 right good
okay i want you to go to the next one start here with 6 times one and write that answer the next answer and the next answer all the way up until you see 24 okay thing find the number that it shows up . the number that shows up the most
the one number that s in common with this row this row and this row yes i m coming 33 yeah i don t know put it on i don t know okay i want you to circle the 5 the 2 and the 4 erase that for me
i don t got an eraser okay 5 watching my points will be passed out momentarily what shh are you hearing me
speaking i know who s doing what workers yes yes on what times 26 times 2 is what 1212 all right you got 6 times one
yes okay what s 6 times 318 okay why does this look like an 8 don t connect the one to the comma then i need you to go back to your desk
i m going to just take my you have 5 minutes because i think some people have forgotten and i have not
i have to jot down come on fall that rug teacher j how you do this okay who else shh watching all right did you circle the 2 the 4 and the okay
that s what i m saying order because you need to look at this bottom number which is called your what denominator huh remember what we ve been taught about that larger number that s here
would you rather have a half of a pie . a half of a pie . or 2 fifths of a pie
2 fifths then we have . so looking at was shaded what fraction would go in order from least to greatest what s the smaller piece going all the way up
this is the smaller piece 3 fourths did it the smallest you think that s the smallest why because you got the smallest piece no the shaded is the piece that you take out
so how much did you eat if i said here s a whole pizza you could eat 3 fourths of the pizza how many have you taken out of there 3 pieces right here s 2 fifths of a pizza here s one half of a pizza 2 pieces right how many did you take off of this
this well a half a whole half of it right okay so which shaded area looks the . the least amount
out fifths 2 fifths okay so this is 3 fourths i m coming
that s one half and that s 2 fifths which one looks like the least amount 1st back pull your chair up okay
it get it done shh you all too was playing this whole time that we were doing math
shh i wasn t okay let s give me 5 i so tell me why you had that order 0 this is the problem tell me why you had that order i m not saying you re right or your wrong
just tell me why you had that order shh okay tell me why you had this order are i have this order because can we do the back the back is for tomorrow even though they all have the shh
the same numerators now that they have all the same numerators we had to depend on the denominators the biggest denominator was like in a pie the biggest denominator is the . is the most . is the most . is the smallest pieces
shh pieces is the has the is the best so that s how i got my answer okay good excuse me 5 shh 4 shh 32 and one okay your voices are all off
admit it was a little challenging but it s okay like i said it is for you to kind of go through and review now we will go over this later on this week but tomorrow you will be doing the other side
side the other side is a little bit different and well as a matter of fact it s a lot different because it s going to be pertaining to some of the work that we are going to be working on today okay so what i want you to do now is place your rally coach paper up in the air thank you and i will hold onto it until tomorrow
turn your desk so you can go back and face shh i m looking for quiet not you i m looking for quiet voices okay yeah dizzy he ll be okay
the 1st team i see ready desk this group right here you a point for you
our objective today is that students and you can write this
will be able to determine the area of a shape area we re in math
0 okay i ll say shape or figure same thing but you need to know that we re going to be looking for the area
area give me 12nd hands down because i need to get through this so give me 12nd area i know i know give me 12nd objective students will be able to determine the area of a shape
the vocabulary that i want you to look at today and then i m going to get back to that question that i just asked this is important vocabulary that you need to know for this lesson is area shh and square unit
just write those 2 things down all right i asked the question that wanted to answer
what is area what is area what is area the area is . is the antonym for perimeter because the area measures the inside of a shape or a figure say it one more time slowly
shh the area is the . the area is the antonym for perimeter because the area . area measures inside good
important he said area measures something inside inside of a figure let me hear you say that good so the number i want you to write this
who can come up and tell me how many square units are in this shape up well we re going to see
see go ahead shh
shh keep that thought start right there very good
can you tell me how many square units you counted 2020 okay listen count 20 she counted 20 so there are 20 square units
now i heard you say right when was getting ready to count she went here with the marker and you yelled out what before that again was getting ready to count and you yelled out 20 right
how did you know to yell out 20 before even counted because you could use a strategy of multiplication because you can go by each row you can count each block one row that would be 4 and all you got to do is count by 4s and then you finish it
or you can go to the outside and the inside of the figure like the row at the top is a 4 and okay side okay i m going to go by what he just said so he said the easy way is to count the row at the top which is 4 and then you can go and you can count the row on the side which was what
55 and what did that he doesn t even realize that he did is he just gave me the formula area the formula with area that a is a representation of or an i would say the letter that stands for area is a this a equals l times w
who could tell me what the l represents what s the l stand for if we have a and we know that a stand for area what do you think l raising your hand what do you think l stand for notes then i put an x
times times and what do you think the w stands for if the l stands for length what s the w stand for width width so what did without even realizing is he gave me the formula for area writing you need to have your pencil going
huh so you just gave me the area formula
area equals length times width so whenever you see these squares you don t it s good to count them but there s also a strategy that you can count the length going down and the length going across and come up with your formula by multiplying the amount going across and the amount going down
w so we have 4 right here and which i made a mistake l i mean the 4 would be the l
the 5 would be the . width so here it is again l would be the 4 the w would be the 5 be area which is
together 202020 by the way do you need to know your multiplication for this type of problem absolutely do you see why do you need to run to the restroom you sure do you see why you need to know your multiplication yes yes 4 equals l which is length w equals 5
equals the width and you put them all together 20 okay let me see if you can flip in your book that i gave you the book on your desk to page 359
can someone look and find the area of the rectangle in the 1st illustration they have it done for you but i want you to count along as i count along
yes all right how many going across 33123 that is your length down 4 again how many going across for your length 33 how many going down 4 if i did area times length times width what would i come up with 12 area equals 12 get that
yes okay let s look at the next one this one you can fill in on your own it says your turn find the area of this rectangle do it by yourself huh find the area of the next one which is that rectangle
359 i 1515 how many did you count for the length
55 how many for the width 3 good 1515 all right let s look quickly on the next page yes we re going to do this really really quick and then we ll continue this tomorrow
arrow it looks like an arrow i want you now to count the units
sorry a square unit is a unit of measuring area
that s your square unit all right friends how many square units did you count 0 how many whole squares did you count 1234 how many whole squares did you count 2345678910
you can count by 2 s too yeah you can count by 2 s all right now watch this there were 10 . whole squares stop there were 10 whole squares
and then and then we re going to stop in 12nd a few minutes excuse me teacher j
hold on 12nd hold . hold on 12nd go ahead now do you see something look this way
shh okay let s look this way
what happens when a square this goes into what we did today review we have a square and it s cut in half answer that s one half 2 halves and one half right well what if i took this top half . and flipped it
see that how many halves do you see on that on that arrow
halves 44 all right so we have one half +one half +one half +one half equals 2 wholes all right you got 2 wholes one shh and that s one so here we are friends
if we have 2 whole squares i mean yeah 10 whole squares and you have one here and one here how many all together jesus do you have
10 i i can t see you have 10 whole squares and then you have one whole and one whole i can t see 2 wholes who said it 12121212 yes 12 is your answer
you have 12 because 10 +2 equals 12 got that yes what now the same thing is with the other one but you have to look at how that square might be cut in half
if it s a half you want to look at the half plus the other half right so for tonight i want you to do some practicing with this lesson and i want you to look at page 361
361361 shh yeah i want you to do page 361 where you ll get some more practice with t his and then tomorrow we ll come together and we ll work this out again
camera shh shh shh i ll wait shh shh shh shh shh then i want you to look on page 362
it wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait shh 61 okay those are the 2 pages you re going to work on tonight
activity 362 no ma am 361 and 3620 shh any questions yes so basically all this that we just did basically all about these 2 pages yes exactly so it s the same thing but like different just different shapes
weeks we are going to find the area of circumference and the circle below
one of the things you need to make sure since we are getting closer to taking the test next monday taking a test on circles we are getting close to taking a test make sure when you get a problem that requires the circumference and the area that you set it up so that you have got 2 separate problems going on and you write down the formula
circumference it is pi times diameter has pi times d or we just started that what is the formula for area pi r squared very good what is d
diameter d is the diameter and what is the r good let us figure out the circumference and the area one of the things you need to make sure you do is make sure you have the correct units because there is a big difference between 80 inches and 80 inches squared thing you got your answer
one as we go think about estimation and how we use it when we are doing circles because when you take a multiple choice test really most of the time you should not have to multiply it
you should be a good test taker and be able to estimate your answer
half circumference should be the easy one for why did you put 7.5 for that
good job
what were you going to say
again distance right across what is the distance across this guys you have got to stop and think what does d mean mean you are not robots
you need to stop and think what do those letters stand for and do circles circles are pretty easy for you guys when you do a bunch of problems that look the same but when you start having to do circumference and area in the same problem is when you make mistakes that it is tricky especially when you have a decimal too
math gets you thinking after a 4 day weekend units do we have feet square feet what have we got
looks good you guys are going to stare at each other all day and squint and glare what is your circumference buddy circumference distance round right
units is that right i will give you about 23 more minutes here
m it is the distance across all the way across across you have got to stop and think for a 2nd radius i need to know the diameter for this circumference problem
15 i have got 3.14 times 15 right for circumference answer i got 47.10
feet why is your feet not squared because it is just the distance of the area we are just talking about the distance around string we were not putting string in squares really remember the distance around the outside right
so you have got 47.10 feet squared or 10 hundredths if some of you wrote 47 one what rule does that violate when we are talking about circumference of an area a it would violate it because we would just drop that 0 when we write it
n why can not we go because it is still the same value 47.10 that is the circumference distance around complicated now let us just say you do not have the exact answer
panic why would i not panic if you did not get the exact answer think as long as you are close what do you think would happen when you take a test look i do not think they are going to give you 40 answers within one value
mister r would get 100 out of 100 right if i sat there at my paper and did 7.5 squared and then multiplied it by pi i would probably get it wrong every once in a while too as long as you show the right stops it is a lot more important that you show the process can anyone tell me if they got 7.5 squared what is 7.5 squared 41.25 that is not correct
what is 7 squared 7 squared is good what would 8 squared be 64 why did i just have you do that 41 is 7 and 8 it is between 7 and 8 right
mistake i do not think that is right either right now if you got that wrong if you are close listen to me world now we have got 56.25 times 3.14
so when i multiply that that is a lot of multiplication is not it estimate what would you estimate 56.25 to be
whatever you think here what would you estimate 56.25 to be
say if you went to the store and you had $56.25 in your pocket and someone said how much money do you have what would your answer be 56 so what would be even easier head what would you take pi to be
have i get what you are trying to do wrong if you had these numbers and your answer is not around 180 you probably did something wrong it is not that i do not trust you guys but i am going to need you to use a calculator with this one
finished show us how good you are i got 176.6250 176.6250 what would you say
176 and 625 thousandths good job okay now is correct yes now last part of the puzzle what are we missing
feet squared because remember what we are saying is there is 176 feet that go through there the little foot by foot tiles 176.25 now what happens if even though she is not some math student got 173.975 do you think she would be okay
yes she would probably say as long as i did my estimates correctly it is probably going to be okay because i do not think if i gave you a test or multiple choice i would not give you these 5 answers that am i really that mean
now if how do i say this mean what is the purpose of math really d to estimate and find out the answer to estimate and find a reasonable answer right
i do not really think math should be about did you multiply a 4 by 3 digit number exactly perfect lot i want you to copy down this input output chart just the chart on the top
time others of you have not done this yet
while now as we finish up circles which will be finished by next monday we are going to do some volume which we are talking about next week and really this is algebra more than anything i want you to copy down what you see up here
ruler let us just do the top 11st
machine you put this number into the machine out pops the bottom number right
different you put in a number and out would pop the bottom number i know it is pretty tiny back you guys can see okay okay we want to find out the relationship between the top and the bottom b does anybody know what a and b stand for
d a is the beginning and b is the end do we know exactly what a and b is at this point relationship if you think you know it hold on for a 2nd what would be a natural instinct when you look at the 3 and the 11
what is the 1st thing you would think of no so that is kind of useless but that is a good idea what is another one we need so we get this 3 and 11 think what would a 2nd or 3rd grader walk in and think they know if they saw the 8 and the 3
add 8 it 8 +8 equals what b it looks a lot like algebra where you have unknown numbers and missing numbers
b now we have got to figure out what do you think how they are related k a times a +2 equals b she said a times a +2 equals b
this a squared +2 equals b right we just did an input output table
now 5th grade ones are like 3 and i will give you an example of a 5th grade on in a minute but they are pretty easy one it is a little bit different 64 6 out pops 216 and 10 out pops 1000
what is your 1st instinct looking at the 1st one b divided by no it has to start with a fine b divided by 9 equals a correct a times 9
connection that is not it right 2nd talk about what you think it is c think about what you think it is
that got an idea
you got this one
other talk it is okay
what do you think
wrong it was the number squared times itself again she said it correctly she said the number squared times itself again 27 4 squared 16 times itself times 4 64
6 squared times itself 36 times 6 is 216 works now how would we say it mathematically a little bit more clearly power what about that what does it equal b b now what does squared mean
times itself what does the a to the 3rd mean 5 where would we ever come up with this 3rd week volume that is what we are getting to next
volume if you are not sure what volume is we are not talking about how loud mister talks volume is like how much space you figure it takes up like a box or this right we need to figure out how much space this 3 d figure takes up this let us do one more input output you guys think you have the hang of it
yes before we do one more just so you know 5th grade ones look like this down what would be the relationship between a and b
output you have got to walk us through how you came up with that but we will give everybody else a 2nd
you do not bug is group because they have already got it good job
it try to write it it write down what you think you know talk with your person next to you
see what they think how would we write it that how would we write it with algebra with algebra you want to get rid of that stuff it one of the things you do when you start writing your formulas is get rid of multiplication it does not need to be an x
cleaner very good that is correct it is going to tell us how she got it 4 i am going to write it exactly like did
a times 4 -3 is what 28 minus b this remember how we are going to get to our cylinder our service area
we do not want to write it long we want to write it as short as possible a not a 4 you never wrote i like your idea it no parenthesis know that is how you would write it
the best way to write this would be 4 a -3 equals b right does not this look a little shorter and tidier than this one okay when you build longer formulas they get more complicated and when you get to do the volume of this cylinder the volume of this cylinder it is not very complicated bad when you do it the longer the formula the more important it is to write neatly
we did input outputs all right what do i need you to do
pencil i am going to hand you a piece of paper now once i hand you a piece of paper i want you to see if you can write down the surface area of a volume formula if you remember it
see if you remember it off the top of your head minute okay on see if you can remember the surface area of the cylinder we can do it together write it down nice and big if you remember
promise just the surface area right
week the surface area it the surface area just like we have been working on
paperclips is going to go to the board you are going to write down what you think how we find the area of the cylinder if we were going to cover the whole cylinder if you are wrong no worries buddy it is the 1st time we have done it where i have not given you the formula
remember you should be getting paid not me if you did not get that copy that down do what has
2 pi r squared +2 pi r h big we just that is fine we just did it like this
who does not have a paperclip now we started this last week but we never really got into why it works in math it is a lot more important why it works instead of just remembering a formula if you know how it works or why it works you can always remember it
who was in my homeroom on thursday when came into my class and i asked her about this formula she is a 7th grader and she told me the exact reason why it do you guys think you are going to remember this formula when you do it together in the 8th grade
do look at this 1st part 2 pi r squared what have we talked about with pi r squared one pretty easy why to find the area of the circles is it 2 pi r squared
me what do we know about these 2 circles radius so in order to find the area of both of them what would you have to do you have to multiply it 2 pi r squared so does everybody that was here you might not know what we are talking about but does everybody understand why it is 2 pi r squared
if we were going to cover it with wrapping paper we would have to cover the top and the bottom with the area of both circles right part 2 pi r h
1st of all what happens if i was going to do what do i have to do with this cylinder what do i do to find the surface area right remember last week when i took this off
what is it practical to flatten this into a rectangle yes it it is possible you can melt down everything has a melting point right
science you can melt this down and mold it into a rectangle could not you would that take a long time a that is right you don t have scissors that go through this so it is not going to work you really think scissors are going to cut through this is that practical
no a long time ago mathematicians thought let us think of a practical way everybody agrees this is a rectangle right
do i want you to take your paper and i want you to make it into a cylinder with your 2 paperclips that is what the paperclips are for make it into a big cylinder just like this like
this follow some directions
j thank you buddy you might need to do it with a partner
circle okay so this is the part that is more challenging is not it
rectangle what shape is the paper at 1st right so we are trying to figure out why is this 2 pi r h
thoughts think about why is it 2 pi r h what do you think the radius is the you have to double it
a the reason you right now we have already eliminated 2 circles s got us started
loud every rectangle has a height do you remember the formula for the area of a rectangle i assume you would remember everything since you are playing right now and next time i have to talk to you you are going to mister k is room does anybody remember the formula for a rectangle what is it width or what would be a different way to write it since it is interchangeable
it diameter times height wait base times height thing does everybody remember this started at 1st is teacher counted with her maybe as a kindergartner maybe your mom did when you were 3 and 4 everything that does is a basis off of that counting
counting she would not know who to subtract she would not know how to multiply or divide without that initial counting when we did a rectangle it is pretty easy to understand why it is base times height right so all mathematicians through history they start with what they know base times height right let us start looking at the similarities between my left circled one and my right circled one
sides height so does everybody understand why they would think to measure the height both sides paper now you are going to share now stop before you open it up think about where your height is
ruler i am going to give you a ruler to share you are going to share so what i want you to do you 3 share share once you get your ruler let us do it in centimeters
share all right i want you to measure it in centimeters you should start
how much is that height what did you get for the height anybody go
half be careful down think about how you did your cylinder did you all get 21 me which side did you measure
right when i say what is the height of the cylinder height means what up and down right when i open it up i am just measuring this side right here right see what i am saying side if you are not sure everybody has got 21 right 21 or 22 now it is just the decimal we do not want to deal with it the 1st time
okay so rectangle equals base times 21 right over here 2 pi r times 21 down right now in order to find the rectangle what do we need to know
base do you all think you can measure the base right now you do not know what the base is of that rectangle you can not find the base it find the base
base let us see okay so now we are going around to 28 times 21
what did you get i did not multiply it yet go spit your gum out right so to find the area of this rectangle what would you have to do
here we need to figure out how 2 pi r equals the base you guys do not understand the base and 2 pi r is what we have not crossed off yet the big question is how and this is what you have to figure out is 2 pi r equal to the base
how is 2 pi r equal to the base r what i want you to do again is go back into a cylinder i will call on you 1st cylinder this is what mathematicians had to do 1000s of years ago to figure out the formula figure out how it works
it think about where your base was think about your base where it was because we all just measured it it you think
cylinder i want everyone to point to me where the base was on this before you folded it base the base is this top circle right when you unfolded it that is your base right okay how do you think why do you think my base equals 2 pi r
because it is going to equal the whole thing e because the base at the end is 2 circles i like it
thing remember it is really times the height too
this base equals diameter times pi where today have you heard pi times diameter
at circumference do you see the circumference we have got this really long formula and i am going to go back and rewrite it again we have got the surface area of the cylinder equals 2 pi r squared
right now we have got 2 pi r h height now this is a tricky part and this is just a fancy way of saying the diameter of the circle circle are you looking at the circumference of a circle right now
yes in order to find the area we have to take the circumference of a circle times the height if i open this up is not this really a 1000000 circumferences of a circle middle that is why if you take the circumference of a circle you know how high it is
this is a bunch of circles all on top of each other right do you have coasters at home that are circles yes just think about how many coasters you would put right there this is just one circumference of a circle over and over again spiral once you know the circumference of a circle all you have got to know is the height
okay how many of you are still not sure or confused
up okay now it is basically saying now we have got this rectangle part and the rectangle and the circle are one in the same are not they
circle now it is basically saying we need to know the circumference of the circle on top height all right now what we are going to do tonight is i am going to give you a handout
out it is confusing but i know in the past once you read it maybe they can do it better than i can then we will talk about it handout pass these out for everybody in your group it was tricky today
out so it says we have got surface area it has got the formula on top
it is trying to break it down to help you and i tried to highlight the important parts cylinder the surface area is a big fancy way of saying top to the bottom with the area of the side in the easiest words think of a can
the surface area is the areas of all the parts you need to cover the can if you bought your mom this for christmas next year i do not know why you would buy her this maybe she has pencils all over the house you would want to cover up the whole thing need you have got to cover the top cover the bottom and the side okay now you can find the area of the top or the bottom that is the area of a circle
squared so since there is both a top and bottom that gets multiplied times 2 that this part we are all good with rectangle the area of the rectangle is the product of its 2 sides
width that is a product of its 2 sides right okay one side is the height of the can okay now the other side is the parameter of the circle circumference since the label wraps around the can does not it go around one time
times why do you think i was telling you not to make a really small cylinder this this is what you did
once since it wraps around once the area of the rectangle is 2 pi r h those 2 parts together and you have the area for the surface area of the cylinder so somebody a long time ago even though you guys are confused right now said hey how do i find the area of this cylinder they said let us look at what we know that is a circle rectangle all right
now here is what you need to know for homework everybody beside do you guys feel okay about doing these on your own tonight if i give you the formula on top okay how many of you have a cell phone with a calculator how many of you have a computer with a calculator who needs a calculator to take home
home okay so let us start with i gave you the formula on the top this now we will try to do we are not going to be able to do one together there all the steps you breaking it down
now as long as i see the steps you are allowed to use the calculator can you listen i have to leave after school but what are you doing tomorrow morning
you now are you getting a car ride or a bus home we will try to work on it for 5 minutes before you leave let us try to do one together really quick all right now did you get one
here all right we were going to do one for time but we ran out of time
there really quick before you leave this is your formula you have to go in like 2 seconds but you are correct a that is our formula we are going to write down every time middle we are going to ignore the middle part
quick i was testing you passed you have 2 pi r squared and 2 pi r h in on the left 2 pi what is r 7 squared you with me okay so far
49 now we have got 2 pi 49 now since you were not here your goal is to keep multiplying those numbers until you have pi left with them
this now this is where we take out our calculator and multiply 98 times 5 side everybody besides is okay calculator anybody go ahead and take one on the way out
i will write your name on the board need one buddy your job for your homework tonight before you leave is to do these 3 cylinder problems and we will keep on working on why it works and do some practice with it tomorrow take a piece of paper and do the whole thing together as a class
leave we are going to have a test on monday on circles including one or 2 word problems and problems like this where i give you the formula
him all right you need your math journal out please and a pencil what are we doing with the camera does it matter didn t she just now say that it does not matter okay i gave directions
them if i have to give directions again you will be getting out your agendas in your math journal go ahead and open to the next empty sheet of paper we are going to be taking notes today on mode median and range today mean so don t stress about the word mean
powerpoint let me get to the right part year what is this mean skip it word the 1st word is median so write that word at the top of your paper
it what do we name the piece of paper she just said it really it still goes with data analysis and we have already started that with our graphing and stuff so we are just going to continue our notes you don t need a new heading at the top so just write the word median and then write the definition it that is the whole definition yes median
it is the middle number on a set of data when the data is arranged in numerical order i can not see numerical you can stand you can stand so you can see 1st can you see it
yes it will take us just a few minutes to get this down and then we will be able to use our information okay yes i can see do we write all of this that is one sentence yes definition teacher is the camera running now yes
math am i in your way while you are finishing that up who can raise their hand and tell me what it means when it says arranged in numerical order b maybe different good try
numerical like in a type of order what type of order means you are putting it in number order like you would see on a number line
2nd okay you can sit right there in is desk fine can you see the notes okay for the camera
arranged in numerical order
all right while you are finishing up some of you are done so i am going to go ahead and give you an example wait i am going to try and wait a 2nd all right so numerical order we talked about that order so if i were to do not put this in your journal because you will have one in a minute you will write down
i put example on mine if i wrote this set of numbers could i call that numerical order is this in numerical order no is this in the order that you would actually encounter them on a number line
no so numerical order is when you actually put them in order from smallest going up to g 44 what would be next in line 6 there is no 6 no we are not writing this
well what do you mean which number we have used the 2 and the 40 let us see 7 is that 8 again notice there is 29s so you have to write 9 twice is this now in numerical order
means so it is very important for median they must be and you might want to underline this 2 times they must be in numerical order if you do not put your numbers in numerical order the chances are finding that median would be pretty slim okay so median when you are talking about a median number is the number that pretty much is in the
middle so that is kind of an acronym median middle sense i can write that you can write the word middle if you like for median example here is your example
go ahead and write this dataset just like it is just like it appears because you are going to arrange it right underneath it 13 actually write that in your journal them you got your numbers
yes whatever you are playing with put it away wait just the numbers not the yeah you don t need to worry about this part just the numbers in red can we write them in order we are doing that next so if you have your numbers written in this order you may go ahead and numerically order them cause that is what you will have to do under that problem she needs an eraser that is hard well then you need to get up and find it
all right if you had this numerical set this set of data how can i put them in numerical order 1st which number would be 1st i am still writing stuff down well let us get it down all of it
1st 3 i don t see a 3 man i thought it was 3 see you have it in this order write it in this order now we are going to write it in numerical order because you cannot find median until you put them in numerical order
g so now that you have it in that order we are going to do numerical order so we can show our example k 11 okay numerical order 11 would be next
next 1111 again cause there is 211s ever how many times you see it that is how many times you have to write it 11 yes do we write this you are writing you write it in this order and then under it you have to arrange it in numerical order because that is what you are going to have to do shortly
you do you write a number in it or what do you mean you are writing exactly what i am writing a 5 do i need to put you up here
good so you should be writing this down r 1313 and all right last it looks like it is in order exactly
order this is something you must do with your dataset before you can find median numbers all right now that we have them in order can we now look for the number that s in the middle together we are taking our notes this is a new word
paying attention okay now you have a dataset order now if i said what is the median number what is that word that we decided is kind of like median that helped us remember what we were looking for
middle okay so median number means the middle number do we write middle do we copy that down you can if you would like median so if we were trying to find the middle number the best thing to do is to look at both ends and match them up in pairs so like 7 and 15 would be a pair
together is that supposed to be medium or what median it is not medium it is not like a size it is median and 1313 and then you see you do have an 11 and a 12 that go together so your middle or median number would be right here
this is a little bit trickier because there is not a number that is skipped but that is okay that so what would be hm what does a median equal the middle we are looking for the middle number yet so if i were looking for the middle number on this it would be somewhere in between my 11 and my 1212 so what is halfway between 11 and 12
k do we call that 11 and a half 11.5 wouldn t that be halfway you want us to draw that yes please do you can write it like this 11 and a half or you can write it like that we have not done a decimals unit yet so you might want to write it both ways so you kind of know
example we will do an easier example just together very quickly before we move on but this is a good one for your notes
great yes madam well just turn your chair move okay go ahead and make sure you have this dataset
the next one you do not have to write down unless you would like examples but this is going to be a little bit easier of an example because this is the kind you are going to encounter you will not encounter a lot of this where the numbers are little halves for 4th grade now in 5th grade you will and have to be able to do halves and 5s and things like that
let us do a slightly easier one for 4th grade do we write this this is the example i just said you don t have to write but you may
now i have 5 numbers here i have a 2 a 4 a 6 a 2 and a 3 this is an easier dataset that you can see that is easy now are they in numerical order
1st i am going to show it underneath there and kind of check it off as i organize them all right what would be next no i didn t see that another 2 another 2 cause there is 22s up there and you will see why we have to do that shortly
next what would be after that 44 would be next and what would be last 66 so this was your dataset
order can we now find the number in the middle what is called the median number match 2 and 6 kind of doing little rainbows
teacher h the middle that is what we are looking for a median which is going to be the middle left 3 so there is it makes it easier when you have an odd number to match them and whichever one is kind of odd man out kind of in the middle there that is your middle number
the what is that word median median this is the median okay so that s a slightly easier dataset that might be easier to see median that is the median you are going to get to practice that shortly ready okay you ready to see the next word
all right there they show you it in order which we already did up go ahead and erase it real quick while i get this ready real quick while she is erasing the board the next word is already up
down your 2nd word is mode m 0 d e like mold no that is mold m 0 l d this is mode m 0 sh you are writing not talking m 0 d e
mean it is the number that occurs the most so there is your acronym mode with most good we can underline that 2 types in the word occurs in case you are not sure what that word means how many times it comes up
whichever one comes up the most number of times is you were mode and your dataset is on the overhead that i am going to give you real quick down and i would underline most 2 times and mode at least one time to show that mode is most most most that wait underline what twice to kind of help you remember
mode seeking underline mode just like you had median middle okay good decided yes that would work good it is like a microphone mode raise your hand if you do not have that sentence
good okay here is your dataset 13 didn t we just write those go ahead and write it again it it does not matter do we write the numbers yes do
write in the numbers do we write the answer we will be writing the answer numbers okay based on knowing mode means the number that occurs the most put it away
know because it occurs the most in this whole entire thing all right so if you look at each of these numbers which one do you see the most often no no so for this one your mode is 11 now it is also important to know that some datasets do not have a mode
if nothing occurs more than once is there anything that occurs the most no so you can have a dataset with no mode let us say for example this was my numbers but i did not have that extra 11 would there be a mode in this dataset no okay what if i had this dataset and i added another 15
2 modes you are very right you would have to mode because this appears twice and that appears twice so 11 and 15 in that case would be a mode do we write it down you do not have to so it is important to remember there can be more than one mode there can also be no mode
star i am one of write it down yeah sometimes i can not see
move you should already know how to spell it
okay sometimes there is no mode and sometimes there can be more than one to and i am just going to throw up an example wall some people are finishing up
do we write this too if you want to show another example dataset and i did that for a reason so you can see you might encounter this know all right what if i had 15 15 12 15 11 11 7 and 13
b 1515 and 15 wait what did you say all right you are right 15 now and i was worried that some people you might have struggled with this but you have 153 different times right times so i have had in the past where people are like boulders to modes because 11 is repeated and 15 is repeated
but it is not about it being repeated it is about which one is repeated the most and 15 would be the mode in that case exactly whichever one is the most whichever one there is more of
hm like can you do like mode like that can you make it a sentence well in this case there would be 2 modes for this one that would be the mode
most teacher h can you make a sentence for that so i can write it down in my book what for the thing where there was 3 15s and 2 11s up so that when the mode is 11
that more than one mode and sometimes there is no mode s so mode is the number that appears the most
agenda here is your last one b okay you are going to miss this note you are going to need to get it from partner when you return further range
before do we write that what do you think range it is the difference i would just start here the difference between the largest and smallest number
yes we have talked about that as relating to your scale on graphs it starts at 0 and ends at 15 then your range is 15 because it is from 0 to 15 15 -0
bit so range difference between the largest and smallest number you ve got it written down okay and then we are going to do an example and will be done with their notes so you can use them while you are doing your small group activity
today because we needed our notes today to get started on them so you would know what to do long let s worry about that when we are done with their notes it are we done with our notes we have to have an example
example i am going to give you a different example to make our note taking a little bit quicker
all right let us say this is your dataset
moment i am still writing the definition that is a long definition you almost have it that s good you got your example down i believe it is he is because he has skinny ones
there your definition is right here okay you got your numbers all right based on this number set you have it 2 4 10 20 and 9
s the difference means what operation is difference 0 because they don t have 2 of the same numbers no i am asking what difference means j like the answer of adding no subtracting subtraction difference is subtraction
so if it is the difference or your subtracting the largest the smallest number from the largest what would be the largest number in this dataset
20 so since we now know difference mean subtraction that is our operation this is difference between largest number and smallest number so what is our smallest number
2 largest number smallest number and you subtract range so what is the range of this dataset 1818 good so make sure you put this part in your notes important so your largest number as this one
one now if you were to go ahead and order the datasets that would deftly make it easier because the smallest number is going to be 1st in the largest numbers going to be last so you are subtracting your last one from your 1st one also if you are also to have to find your median number would it be easier if they are already in order
order and your mode it would be very easy to see the mode because if you had duplicate numbers they would be side by side so you always want to order the numbers numerically h raise your hand if you do not have the notes
do are you supposed to write the number line no just this dataset right here otherwise this means nothing range all right what were going to do today you are going to be using these notes you just took on median mode and range
if you have a question and you are not sure i forgot what median is do you come talk to me
helpful we are going to break out into one small group basically pulls small groups to see me while everyone else will be working with a set of data using little cars and ordering them and answering questions based on them using your notes make sense yes okay the table that i am going to use today for small group is this one and the main reason is it is harder to see these low tables with us sitting on the floor
here so if you sit here and normally you will just have to sit at someone else is desk today okay all right so everyone else when i give you your data you will be working quietly at your own seats and then i will be working with small group here and then i will call another small group and another like that
clear and you are going to need your binder teacher h can i have another pencil mine is yes did you give me that one back the other day one just give it back when you are done teacher can i use the bathroom yes all right i need let us see i will start with you 3 because you are already here
i need and g if you will come sit over here also what do we need you just need your pencil and your notes
yes do you need like 2 pencils because i only have 11 is fine do not do anything yet can i go to the water fountain yes
everyone else while you are waiting for small group you have things to do 1st you are going to take your dataset a this is just to remind you was that it is you need to cut your set apart so you can order them
order the enemy you will have your questions that you need to answer based on your set of data and this is your answer key here questions one through 5 these are the questions
no you will be seeing this piece of paper again tomorrow with a new dataset and a new answer key in okay so coming out to you no if you turn the heat up it will be blazing hot by 3 0 hot do you want a check in your agenda turn what heat up
that one i just started i just put it underneath his note thing who were you talking too she wanted to turn the heat on go 123 you can come get one there thank you here is you one
and this one and this one and if you don t have scissors there should be some in the back all right if you will pass everyone out one of these there are we supposed give everybody one of those that would be great any extras just set them back up here
here there is some in there okay you need to get busy on that you have to cut them apart arrange them answer the questions on the answer key start you are going to use them and then you can make them in order do you have to glue them you can
that would be easier here h yes yet sh once you order them you can answer your questions on the answer key
you can glue your dataset in order numerical order and glue your answer key onto the construction paper understood anybody not sure of that in okay don t worry about it
ready we got to do that just the ones in here put the rest back up here there okay dataset coming out are oops all right datasets coming out
all right the next thing i would like you to do is take your cards out of your data out of your bag i did that i have a 2 a 3 a 7 a 9 okay just put them in order on your desk 1st thing you need to do is take your dataset out and arrange them in order okay if i said put them in order or numerical order smallest to
largest so you can pull them out so you can see them and then actually put them in numerical order okay numerical order i did it okay you guys know what you are doing is that thing done no it is still recording
go okay go ahead and get started do they watch everything we do yes all right go ahead and get them in order some of them maybe missing a card that is okay
they may be missing a card no mine is not stuck together mine has 212s here you go
you they are not stuck together come join us since is not here here you need this sheet that sheet just leave that there and bring your pencil i need to do something else all right let us look at our dataset
yes they are in correct numerical order what order should they be in guys you need to be working quietly you are taking too long i have it it just fell on the ground so take your notes and go work on this other activity
you can put yours in the middle go work on this activity that i have already explained the paper the dataset and the answers and check with a friend in class who was in here here you are sitting here floor wait a 2nd
let have a seat boys and girls that are working you need to be working a little quieter because they need to be able to hear small group no just the red one so you need to work quietly sit there all right in numerical order nice and loud what order should they be in
2379121225 okay so go ahead and put them in that order down this is your question sheet to answer all the questions based on the cards you have over here you put the answers over here glue your answer sheet on there but turn the questions back in
sheet okay anything over there would be fine all right so name paper now let us look bag you find the mean median and mode we are going to skip mean because we are going to range instead okay in the directions it does but actually the word mean is still there
dataset what is the mode of this dataset notes 12 all right i am hearing 9 and 12 definition i know it is the number that has the most the one that occurs the most
in this case it appears 2 times but what if something appeared 3 times or 4 times okay don t do that again or you have a check please teacher h i put it in order yes that is the directions for dining your information
order so mode how do we know that the mode is 12 know because there is 2 there is 212s there is more than one all right because the 12 appears the most number of times good
12 because 12 has the most good yes i don t get number 2 not number 2 number 3 well it is giving you a definition of range plus it is in your notes number all right median what would be the median oops i do not remember i do
do what would be the median the median would be the middle number 9 median means middle so which one is the middle 99 is correct and if you match them up 1st and last go together the next 2 go together the next 2 go together what would you be left with 9 take off both ends and you will be left with 9
know 9 is the median what was it said because 9 is in the middle middle good do we have to write what is number 3 range range should only be one number numbers you on task
e all right and i know the range can i say it correct how do we know 23 is correct for the range
range easy easy easy sh check in your notes what does range mean mean okay so we said it was 23
largest 25 all right 25 and difference means we are going to 22 so we will pull the 2 and if you subtract that all right so how do we know 23 is the range
it because it is the largest number minus the smallest number
2 you got your answer
check all right this is just information reminders done take your paper and you can go ahead and start this next activity
want no i really want to staple it together like that and you can leave it on your desk for now do all right looks good
go there you go people just try to figure that out look how do i get mine to close all right you got yours all right this group once you finish up you will get one of each of those things we discussed and work on that small group activity
h that is fine i would like to take a group that is finished or close to being finished c teacher h can i go to the bathroom yes and then just you can find a seat over there or over there somewhere to work table but you are close
you have the answers written on your thing right on your answer sheet yes i am borrowing i will take k teacher h i did this and all i have is this you are working on the answers i ll take you in a 2nd i want you all right go ahead dataset i only have enough space for one
what is the 1st thing you need to with the cards put then in the order number order good i will try to move this out of your way so you ve got some space you know what to do order so here is your paper where we are going to record our data information that we talk about
bag here you go if you want a treat you can grab that one right there at the computer all right let us make some space so he can join us room are we supposed to write these on here that would be the best thing yeah
it doesn t matter you don t need the a but if you want to glue the a down you can you don t need that part it doesn t matter i was going to ask you no not the a just glue this on there glue this just so it is out of your way i have to anyways she is going to make us go all right so the 1st thing we have to do is number put our dataset in order numerical order right yep
keeps shoving me good all right so once they are in order we can now answer our questions right
name i did name good teacher h can i go fill up my water bottle number one what is the mode in this dataset and it does give you little tiny reminders at the bottom but you can also check your notes s 12 how do we know that
12 is correct it is the same these 2 they got the most okay so is 2 more than one know so 12 is the answer and then how do you know because 12 appears the most task i have liquid glue right over here
and then put it in the back yes that would be fine median which number is the median median 9 okay he is thinking 9
see can i match up my last number with my 1st number down but i put 3 with 12 7 with 12 and then what would be left yes so 9 and how do we know 9 is correct
because it is the middle number right it is the one in the middle very good i do this 0 just to get them space wise yeah but normally you take them all the way out huh that one goes this one okay the last word is range
no what do you think 25 what about 2 and 25 i think that that is the range okay the range is from 2 to 25 so how would we figure out the rest of that k what do i do with 2 and 25
25 subtract them cause we are looking for the difference right difference so you pull the 25 because it is the biggest the 2 because it is the smallest and what kind of operation subtraction with 25 -2 the range is 23
it teacher h may i go to the restroom i was talking to him because he wrote the 2 numbers down you wrote your name on that so we will have to hold on to that for you to use again tomorrow together don t staple it though you don t need to staple it
just put the questions with your work and just put them in the napkin so you will have them for tomorrow all right how do we know that 23 is our range ahead because you subtract the sh
again because because you take out these 2 because that is the range and then you minus them okay you take the largest and smallest number and subtract correct that yeah that is fine 0 i have got the worse hiccups ever does that make sense largest minus the smallest number would give you the range
yeah technically i don t want those glued but it is okay if you did deal can i go to the bathroom you re fixing to come see me so you need to hurry it can wait until after math good everybody have their range
i found this want me to put these back in the bag yes if you are done well no leave them out there i would mix them up though and make it hard for the next group and i ll take your papers if you are finished you need to have a seat
k can i go to the bathroom can i go quick to the bathroom yes what do we do next okay i realize some of you are starting to finish up but that does not give you authority to bounce around the room like you are outside at recess
yes is this the correct order are they in numerical order okay then that would be correct where is your answer sheet 2 i said i would just use whatever you would like better and glue that one
those are all words that not all of them we re going to use today but as we introduce the unit today those are all words that you will see over the next couple weeks what i m going to ask you to do now is i m going to ask you actually tuck your word search into your desk
okay as soon as you re done eyes up here please could you put your word search in your desk please yes
j remember i should only have to say something once and you follow the directions okay and before we get started up here is our goal for the day remember how in morning meeting usually we set a goal how we re going to behave for the day what we re going to do to make a good day okay so at any point i ever say to you what are we trying to learn today it s up there so you know what we have to do
okay so in our new unit we re learning the shape of data or day ta ways raise your hand if you ve heard it data raise your hand if you ve heard day ta okay
way so what we re going to have to learn today is you re going to be able to describe or explain how and why we collect data okay and you re going to be able to explain a line plot
raise your hand if you did a line plot in 3rd grade you did good it s a into some graphs getting us into bar graphs those if not we re going to do one today you re actually going to create one with boxes of raisins okay so who can tell me what the word data means
j like information it s exactly that data why is data important you see data every single day every single day you have information that people have collected for you h without information we wouldn t know anything we wouldn t know how to do it so if we have information it will be easier for us to do what we need to
okay can you please put your gum out in the barrel please why do we have data data is like information that you use to well i lost it use and what do we use that information for like for okay
maybe you want to collect your data of your electricity bill and i looked from january to december and i looked at what i paid every month for my electricity bill and i noticed that in the summertime my bill my amount goes a little bit higher because i probably have my air conditioner running right so i know maybe i collect that data and i know to put some extra money aside for the summertime
t scientists have to collect a lot of information about all kinds of stuff scientists are when you think of collecting data that s usually the 1st profession the 1st person you think of is a scientist don t you they collect a lot of data because they re doing a lot of what
e experiments experiments they do a lot of experiments they have to collect data so they know if the medicine works they have to collect data if they know special tires on a car work
they re always collecting data to see how they can improve things so today we re going to collect data not really like a scientist we re not making up a new medicine to cure the common cold okay we re just figuring out how many boxes of raising we re going to have in the classroom how many we have one 2 3 4 because some are out 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
box and we re going to find out what s the most common number you see okay why would it be important let s say i needed to buy raisins what might i need to buy raisins for activity for your health for your health to eat them what do you use raisins in sometimes
grapes raisins are grapes
cereal i might put them in my oatmeal what are those great cookies oatmeal oatmeal raisin cookies so maybe i need to know how many raisins are in a box because i need a certain amount of raisins for my cookies right so it s always good to have the data so i know how many boxes of raisins i might need
do all right so the 1st thing we re going to do is i m going to give you a piece of paper towel desk i m going to give you a box of raisins you cannot open your raisins you ll be able to because i told you yesterday that once we re done you can eat them if you d like them maybe someone at home likes raisins
maybe you want to take them home so they can put them in their oatmeal or maybe you can say can you make me some oatmeal cookies and they can make them today
that you will be able to open them but not just yet because we have to do a little testing a little experimenting can i actually have 2 volunteers let s see i need 2 volunteers that are sitting nicely their desk is clean and organized let s see you can come pass out paper towels for me
actually why don t you do the back 3 rows for me and front 3 groups and if you could give one that would be great and let s see my raisin person come on over
one box of raisins for each person now you can squeeze your box you can smell your box you can look at it open one more paper towel who sits here
n give yourself an extra thanks you re going to when i tell you to just open the lid and look
yes at the beginning of the year remember i get those special forms that tell me if you re allergic to anything we had no raisin allergies good thing huh
everybody has a paper towel 5432 and one
one those of you that didn t you need to pull yourself together everybody has a paper towel yes yes okay does everybody have a box of raisins yes
you if you want to sit up here you don t have to sit okay now here s your direction the 1st step that i need you to do did everyone squeeze it yeah okay you re going to just open the lid you can t touch the raisins you can t take the raisins out
it you can t touch the raisins you can t take them out it now by looking at the top of your box you can t touch any of them you can t move a raisin looking in the top corner of your paper towel i want you to write down how many raisins you think are in that little box
one here honey start over right here k give me a specific number
4 okay okay once you re done you need to be appropriate don t ignore me when i m speaking to you please okay
down raise your hand if you want to tell me how many raisins you think just by looking at the top are in the box
25 18
23 all right so a lot of you have 0 sorry miss t 47 a lot of you have a guess that s within the further end of the teens 18 19 up to the 30s
40s so we ll have to see who s right now what you re going to do nope no one s doing anything yet because i haven t told you the next step cubes you know when we used the cubes from the bucket for our arrays and multiple towers and things yes we can t just dump them out because they fall on the floor and miss d says i don t want to see them on the floor we can t use them again if you can t use them properly
you are going to take your raisins and you re going to dump them out on your paper towel doing and you need to get an exact count of how many raisins now some raisins are big some raisins are small raisin count every piece as a raisin
out can i get the pleasure of doing that some of them get stuck on the bottom you can stick your finger in there to squish them out out kind of like cranberry sauce huh
you have to open up both sides to be able to get it out yeah
you re worrying about counting when you re done counting again write your number on your paper towel and circle it so you know that s your exact count they are sticky raisins are sticky you counted already
so okay write them down mister l can you get that please alrighty who has their final count
36 x 37
32 make sure your chair stays down please don t hurt yourself 36 miss t 38
33 37 35 37 okay wait you didn t get me
wow okay let s take a peek this is everybody in the class this is the amount of raisins they have lap your hands are not touching your raisins that s the 2nd time now
you 36 38 39 39 40 this is a jumble of numbers no if i were to say to tell me the mode the raisins that have the most amount of numbers the number you see the most
no it s not easy to pick it out right now because you d have to sit there and count through and say okay 39 39 39 well i see a lot of 38s too so let s see it would take a lot of work it would take a lot of work to see as one big list you could make a line 39
right now i might want to take my data and make it more organized make it easier on the eyes right make a line make 39 and then the make a line plot you think yeah would that be a good idea yes yeah could i have you come up to the board please you cannot eat your raisins yet
you should do a line plot can you hold this up for me very inappropriate and i have to repeatedly talk to you when you re talking and laughing when i m trying to teach a lesson i m not very pleased you will be on the wall
continue to argue your only recess tomorrow too your chair should be on the ground and you should be sitting like a lady how did his feet get under your chair thank you
0 this tape is sticky all right thank you my dear
okay so i m going to i could draw on my whiteboard but then i d have to erase it right and that would be no fun what we re actually going to do is we re going to use your raisin boxes instead of x s
okay now before i create a line plot obviously i have a line and it s called the line plot because i m going to plot my data i m going to put it up on there so i can see it i can see the shape of the data name you have to name every single graph bar graph pie chart
anything that you create it needs to have a name so that way you know what your data was that you collected out just like when we talk about a word problem you can t just put the number right if it s 37 oranges you have put the word oranges i need to know what you re talking about so if someone were to come in and say 0 great line plot
collecting what s the data it s all about you have to make sure your title s up there so people know so let s brainstorm what do you think the title of my line plot should be raisins we re not finding the average yet the average is something we can find once we ve plotted of all our data so keep that in mind
okay okie dokie how about you x the mode of the raisins mode of the raisins again we re not finding the mode that s something we can find after we plot all of our data
a raisin is that what you said raisin brands raisin brands raisin branch raisin brand bran the cereal no
brand i don t know okay i m going to assume that it doesn t fit okay so i have to change your 39 to a 36s okay how about how many raisins in a box so well it s a raisin plot but what am i trying to find out
well you could start with one 2 3 okay i could start with 0 one 2 3 4 right numbers because if i go from 0 all the way to what s our largest number 48 50 does that give me just that area that i can really see the shape of the data
together i don t want to squish everything together i want to be able to look at it and actually see the data where there s the most let s see 30 i think 30 is my lowest number right 39 no there was a 20 before there s another 30
so i have 30 is my lowest number do i want to start my line plot with 30 30 now what do i want to end my line plot with 48 do i have to end my line plot with 48 no could i end it with 50 and make it look a little more even
numbers that way too if 30s here and 50s here i already know what my midpoint should be 40 that makes it a little easier for me to create my chart 35 and now let s see make sure i get it
45 good for you guys now what goes between 30 and 35 34 so i need 4 even numbers even spots right
see does that look about right i m going to look for 3 volunteers my 1st volunteer is going to fill in from 35 to 40
my 2nd volunteer is going to fill in from 40 to 45 and my last volunteer is going to fill in from 45 to 50 here so i showed you how your spacing should really look didn t i should you have 36 37 38 39 all in this little spot right here
see now if doesn t do it correctly should we yell out and say that s wrong no no just wait patiently because we can always fix our mistakes can t we
that s how we learn while you re waiting you may eat your raisins if you d like just remember once they re gone you don t get more so you might want to savor them one by one and i m sorry for those of you that got 30 and got 48
you lose out on 18 raisins all right let s take a peek did do a nice job i have 36 37 38 that looks spaced pretty nicely doesn t it see what am i going to need through 40 and 45
44 all right why don t you come on up you re going to keep the boxes because we re going to actually put the box where the amount of number of raisins you have so let s say that you had 34 raisins how many did you have 36 so you re going to come up and put your box of raisins and you re going to stick it right above 36
a little bit more yeah so put your 42 here go alrighty my last volunteer let s see let s see let s see 49 so maybe 46 right there right where my nail is
it you what does anybody not like raisins don t put them back in the box because i m going to need your box but if someone in your group wants to munch on them you can share them only in your group only in your group you re not getting up across the room to share raisins that s how raisins end up on the floor and stuck in your sneakers that s mighty disgusting very good
alrighty can you do me a huge favor actually you know what we can just use this table i was going to use the other table but this will actually stick better anyways if you had 30 raisins raise your hand now i only have 2 30s up there so i should only have 2 hands who had 30 raisins
you should have it written down honey so and bring your raisin box up to me and you re going to be our 1st people to show what we do okay so here s your raisin box here s your raisin box
his very nice so how many do i have in 32 do you think now i should look at my list and cross out the 2 30s
30 okay did anyone have 31 it box go ahead and stick it
now should stick his raisin box up here no right okay go ahead 0 miss d has an itchy eye what a scientist make sure it s nice and stuck on there there we go
alrighty so we can now cross off my 32 r bring your raisin box on up i ve never tasted raisins before you ve never tasted raisins before line it up with the 330 sorry if you don t feel comfortable trying them you certainly don t have to
but if you want to be living on the edge today then go for it 34 i have only one 34 how many raisins did you have
nancy come on up honey yeah make sure it s lined up with the other ones 35 i have 2 35s right who are you
and who else come on up r okay go ahead
you can go 1st now you re going to have to make sure that your 2nd one is lined up with the one over here okay what can you tell me about my line plot so far far anything so far we re still in the 30s okay so far we re still in the 30s
we have a lot of raisins in the 30s x so far there are the same 35 and the ones in between 31
31 has none 30 and 35 have the most boy i have 123
right so let s see if you re a 36 er come on up 36 i have it on my paper go back and sit down go back and sit down all of us you go back and sit down now i have 3 people that told me 36 and is also one right you have 36
okay now i have he had 37 okay who was the 1st person i asked 36 calm down you have 38
that 39 was 36543 see here s the thing that happens with collecting data up so we re going through one by one right now to see where i need to make a change
because i can t just put 36 up there and keep my other numbers up there change go sit down for a moment please d just wait 5 seconds please 36 36 you told me 39
0 yeah so is that what you have 39 40 you were next
39 what did you have 37 chairs pull your chairs and on the bottoms who has 40
anybody you have 40 so you re my only 40 up there 39 no i had go sit down
okay so people are changing their numbers and that s not okay no we need to go through and we have to see who has what 36 yeah 38 yes 36 yep 39
40 huh you have 48 yes 30 was who d you have 40 yeah who has 39 now
39 yeah you should ve given me your real number not your prediction so what s that what do you have 34 who else has 34 just had 34
what do you have 37 you recounted and you have 36 no i so you have 37 for real right
d 35 was
37 so the 2 of you have 36 however i m assuming you were up here 39 and you guys told me 34 and 37
data so if you recount you have to make sure you tell me just so i can fix it j and you didn t tell me 36 the 1st time
right boy that s a mess a big mess now if you are a 36 that s you already came up
up and
ago you re having a very difficult time following directions today because i wrote it up there 0 good now just put a 3rd one up yet so he has to make sure that he s right above his row his column i mean
sorry okay alrighty very good 37 come on up and
there you go sir 0 that s all right no big deal
do you want to put yours up there it has to be lined up right with that guy okay and then can you tie your shoes no i don t want it upside down i want it the other way it go ahead go have a seat i love it
box i m pretty sure by 4th grade i thought you could handle doing a raisin activity right okay do you want to put up miss t s all right you have 38 too
they have to come and get you shop honey someone will be coming to bring you down you have 38 too yeah okay i know that
it s up on the board can you go put your name right in there for me
39 come on go put your name right there for me
41 do you all have any more between the 40s 48 what s my last 40 48 come on up
right above 48 sitting i should have your eyes up here and your hands should be touching nothing
anything unless you re eating the raisins that s fine what s the most amount of raisins in a box that we have 36 i m going to introduce a word to you called an outlier
is what s an outlier what do you think i think it s where most of the things are on one side and there s one on the other side okay it usually means i have one that s kind of all by itself not every line plot has it
48 48 is my outlier it s the one that s kind of all by itself here s my clump my clump of data where most of my information is and then i have one that s kind of lonesome my 48
x what s my range what s my range now the line plot goes from 30 to 50 but that s not my range 48 my mode is 36 okay
and we ll be using this later to do different lessons this week and next week to find the median and things like that is let s find out what s data what s data information information why do we collect data
why do we collect data why do we collect data because data for many reasons give me one why did we collect data today for the raisins how much raisins in a box because i wanted to know how many raisins were in a box
n it was almost just like making the graph but and you want to know how much area is for the same amount okay how did i collect my data today what did i do to find out how many raisins were in the box what s the 1st thing we did we made the numbers on the number list what s the very 1st thing we did
we made a prediction we opened it up we looked at it we made a prediction and then what did we do to find out the actual number we look at the smallest to biggest what did we do to find out how many raisins were in the box we looked at people that numbers like 39 and 36
box i took them out and i counted you took them out and you counted okay plot you ve told me what the mode is the range where our clump and outlier is see i m going to have come around when i say 5 he s going to collect all your trash
so today boys and girls you probably all know that we have counters on our desks and for the people that left for the computer lab we actually went through all the counters
there should be you re not opening them or touching them right now 30 counters okay why do we need counters today teacher b we used to use these when we were in kindergarten 1st grade maybe even 2nd grade okay well we can use counters for lots of different things
activity as you can see our objective this morning students will be able to use counters these are called counters to find fractional parts of a number together students will be able to use counters to find fractional parts of a number
so what word or words stand out to you there s fractional fractional what does that mean to you that s part of a fraction of so you know in the word fractional is the word fraction and what does fraction mean to you
it means to like cut into pieces cut something into pieces okay cut something into pieces we can take a whole something and cut it into pieces yes what about a bunch of things
pieces yes are we cutting it into pieces or are we just breaking it into halves sections sections or groups what is it groups groups yeah so if i had a bunch of m ms we re not going to cut those m ms into sections
we re going to put them into groups groups but if we had a whole candy bar and we wanted to break that up we would break that into pieces pieces or sections and then we d make kinds of groups right so we re going to find i said counters and pencils on your desk did i not
you so we re going to find fractional parts of a number so we re going to take a number and we re going to find parts of it now we have been working so far with the number one so far all we ve dealt with with fractions is the number one
parts sections and when we say 2 fourths we re talking about half 2 out of the 4 sections but it s one whole 2 fourths of one whole
far this time now when we take fractional parts of a number that number instead of talking about one that number is going to get bigger so we re going to do a couple of examples we re going to do a couple examples
excellent so if i said to you teacher b has 6 apples she brought in 6 apples and she would like to share them with some people
in fact i m willing to share them with only and i m going to say to i m willing to give you if you re really good today half of my 6 apples and is saying 0 great
today teacher b is going to give me half of her 6 apples how many of you think you can figure out how many apples is going to get get i know i have 6 apples and i m willing to give him half
get m 3 apples he s going to get 3 apples
s 3 sixths 3 sixths 3 you re going to get 3 do you think see here s one apple here s 2 apples apples here s 4 apples 5 apples 6 apples
i hope they don t look too much like cherries no they don t so i took my 6 apples and i actually if you notice i put them into 2 groups groups i strategically placed them
i put them in 2 groups because the denominator is going to tell us how many sections how many groups there should be and that s important the denominator we always try to look at that denominator 1st in the fraction that s the number the part that we re very interested in groups so i put my 6 apples into 2 groups remember these 2 groups or 2 sections always should be what
equal equal one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you and if you ever have any extra that s not good but you could just stick it off to the side so now we ve used the denominator
numerator the numerator is what we re interested in as far as how many are shaded how many are blue how much was eaten how many have pepperoni on it whatever we re talking about well i said that i would give one half one out of 2 to of my 6 apples if he was good today
today so we re going to then look at the one group just one of them it doesn t matter which one i can look at number one or i can look at number 2 but the one thing we re interested in is one group group 33 so how many apples is going to get
of 6 and when i was asking how many apples is going to get actually said he s going to get 3 sixths he is them so that s easy right how many people think 0 my gosh teacher b really
right easy peasy well we re not always going to be working with 6 and we re not always going to be working with one half the numbers are going to get larger and the fractions are going to get more challenging
in so we re going to start off with some easy problems just so i can see that you understand how we re going to use our counters break them into groups and figure out how many groups we re talking about ready yes now usually what i do is these are called 2 sided counters
usually when i use the counters i usually use the yellow side so when i take them out i put down the yellow side okay so what i want you to do is i want you to count out 10 counters out of your bag out just take out 10 and leave the rest in the bag and make sure that they re on the yellow side
i m going to get the camera on ready to go the camera is not on
okay 10 counters excellent can you just get rid of that paper that s on your desk i don t want that to be in your way
so we re going to actually find 3 fifths of 10
so i want to show you that s what we re going to find 3 fifths of 10 counters yes yes so now we re going to look at the denominator 5 so that s going to tell us how many groups
so we re going to take our counters and we re going to go one group 2 groups 3 groups 4 groups and 5 groups and we re going to sort of spread them out them so make 5 groups want everyone has 5 groups
yes okay so with the rest of your counters not the ones in the bag the rest of your 10 counters put them in each group one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you i m even going to make sure it looks like they re in the group so i m going to have them touch
yes and i ve used all my counters yes yes and i ve put my 10 counters into 5 groups now remember our problem is 3 fifths of 10
numerator 3 is what we re interested in 3 pepperoni how many are shaded how many are blue all that groups so i want you to actually take one group put together a 2nd group and push together a 3rd group like that so we re interested in 3 groups
group i pushed another group together and a 3rd group together so you have one group 2 groups and 3 groups that 6 how many 1066 so 3 fifths of 10 equals 6
6 pretty easy right but how many of you if i said to you no counters students m 3 fifths of 103 fifths of 103 fifths of 10 you wouldn t be able to do it
know but using the counters you can actually see i have 106 does it make sense making sense okay reach into your bag and take 2 more out that what s that
showing i thought you kept it like this because one side is red and one side is yellow so basically the shaded will be red or something like that well that s kind of what i do
right our new problem is 3 fourths of 12 okay we do understand that we re being filmed and that you have a microphone actually very close to you so we have a choice to actually turn around and participate in the lesson or i m going to have to ask you to leave choice so we shouldn t be turned around to the people behind us to see what s going on
okay we re going to make good choices 123 fourths of 12 we re looking at the fraction what are we interested in everybody the denominator excellent and what s our denominator 4 so that s going to tell us how many multiple students groups
now was saying teacher b i thought you were going to take those red ones and tell us how many were shaded i kind of do that sometimes ways we re going to keep it just on the yellow for right now so one group 2 groups 3 groups 4 groups 4 groups right
groups and then take the rest of your counters and put them into the 4 groups and always do this boys and girls one for you and one for you and one for you and one for you because otherwise you can end up with too many in one group
remember it always has to be it begins with e 3 we go to the numerator once we ve made our groups now we re looking at the numerator the numerator is telling how many are shaded how many we re going to eat how many we have eaten how many are pepperoni how many are blue
this time we re interested in how many groups are we going to put together 3 so here s one group 2 groups 3 groups now what i ve done before is that i turn them over but sometimes that can be a lot of work
can so how many is 3 fourths of 12 93 fourths of 12 equals 9
9 excellent so i m going to show you one that is an impossibility and i m going to show you why
we re going to keep our 12 and this time we re going to find 5 sevenths of 12 12 so that means we take our 12 and we make what
7 7 groups so one 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 groups and then i take the rest of my counters and i put them in each group right
what happened though there is not enough out and this is when everyone should be looking up here this is when you say it s an impossibility we cannot find 5 sevenths of 12
it so if you ever get to that point you re not going to be able to do that just an fyi i ll never give you a problem that you can t do and neither will any kind of book or a worksheet or anything like that 5 sevenths of 12 it has to be able to be divided equally
your counters have to be divided equally right yes i m sorry i said does it have to be your grade level excellent so what i want you to do we have 12 out
more can you actually take all of yours and i m going to have you sit in the back of the room please you re going to need all of yours and take your pencil you so if you took out 6 more how many do we have
18 i m seeing a few on the floor so make sure we re not losing any 18 yes when we were simplifying some of the problems already were simplified 0 sure absolutely
and the other ones were improper fractions okay push your 18 off to the side and then your bag you can push off to the side too worksheet you re going to put your name at the top and this is going to have all of our problems on it here pass one back to
can you actually go in the seat there so that you re facing the board there you re going to put to on the back table and and are actually going to grab their paper from there
you have to sit in the chair like is so he s facing the board okay everyone has a paper and they re going to put their name on it
you actually need to count out 18 and leave the rest in the bag so everyone should have 18 counted out and ready to go
honorable if you look on your paper the directions say we re kind of halfway down it says use counters
find each fractional part of the number by separating the counters into equal groups that s what we have been doing and record your results on the chart i m just going to go up to the very top just so we can read their explanation top yes it says look at these 15 counters what fractional part of the 15 counters is shaded there are 3 groups
yes one of the 3 groups is shaded so that means 13rd of the 15 counters is shaded shaded 55 counters so this is where you could turn them over to the red so whatever the numerator is how many groups you re turning over that s what part is shaded
no we re going to do the 1st few together and then we re going to move on quick s because the denominator is a multiple of the number on the side okay
is saying i think i see why this is easy he s saying the denominator is a multiple of this number yes let s think about that 18 wait that do you want to change that
18 is 18 is a multiple of 2 work that s why that 5 sevenths of 12 wasn t going to work because 12 is not a multiple of 7
but instead of saying when you 1st start 2 is a multiple of 18 and then you want to just switch it 18 is a multiple of 2 let s find that word that would work there that remember it s opposite they work together 2 is a factor of 18
so the denominator they re only going to work when you have a factor of that number or 18 or 12 is a multiple of the denominator okay so we ve got 18 want how many groups do we want 2 2 look at the denominator 2 and then we re going to be interested in one group
it there are my 2 groups group now i m interested in one of the 2 groups 9 we re interested in one of the 2 groups and you want to separate those groups
in okay now i would not suggest to make this go a little bit faster i would not suggest okay you messed up the 18 problem the next problem is 13rd 13rd of 18
do i m going to take one out of the group and i m going to make a 3rd group and then i m going to keep taking one of out of each group until i have equal amounts
and i m just going to double check one 2 3 4 5 6 that i have equal amounts in each group just always make sure that you have equal amounts in each group groups 11 group one group how many is in one group 6
easy okay 18 so now all you have to do is put together the 2 groups of the 3 what is 2 thirds of 18 now
12 okay i want you to do the next 216th of 18 and 3 sixths of 18
i want you to do the next 2 and i ll come walking around and seeing that you re all doing them correctly groups it s supposed to be on yellow 1st of all and there are your groups
groups and you need to make sure yours is spread apart right that s what i did yep make sure yours is spread apart
2 thirds 0 yeah okay so 6 groups group okay
so what is 16th now you have 6 groups one group 031 group what s the next problem groups look 3 groups
so there s 2 groups 3 groups so what is 2 thirds 2 thirds is 913rd 2 thirds 3 thirds what s 2 thirds 2 thirds is half of 2 thirds is how many okay now start on this 116th of 18
6 so let s see them these look good good just make sure that your groups are separate okay just because if you push them all together it s hard to sort of see
0 yeah okay yeah now it s 3 sixths of 18 now 33 of the 6 so there s one groups 2 groups 3 groups that one
one okay do i looked around at a few and i think they looked really good i have to count how many are in there yes
then you count how many are in those 3 one 2 3 4 5 6 and you should have them separate there are your 6 groups okay one 2 3 4 5 6 groups
right now you re interested in 3 groups one group 2 groups 3 groups how many is there okay you want 6 groups and i said only 18 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
we want 6 groups one 2 3 so using the 18 4 5 6 we re going to make 6 groups one 2 3 4 5 6 and then you put one in each group
teacher b did i count it right i think so okay so now we have 6 groups and there s an equal amount in each group
we re interested in one of the 6 groups how many is in one of the 6 groups down the next 13 sixths again look at the denominator 6 groups which we have yes we re interested in 3 of the 6 groups one group 2 groups 3 groups how many is in that
9 all right i just want to make sure that if you look at the very top of your paper some people are chatting right now we look at the very top notice how they took those 15 counters and they separated the 3 groups
yes yes some of you are pushing them all together then give them some space when you make each group all right 3 and who can tell me then 36th of 18
excellent all right you are going to do the next 3 we re going to do one ninth 2 ninths and then 4 ninths so how many groups groups and if you are having a little trouble raise your hand now we re doing the ninths so 9 groups one ninth what are you going to do
i m going to do 9 so i want to see 9 groups i want to see your 9 groups
i already did a group but i still should see 9 groups right 9 groups so something is going wrong
not so i want you to start over here groups no 9 groups
group that means 2 groups 3456789 now you ve made 9 groups now you take the rest of these and you say okay one for you and one you and one for you we re going to go orderly
out make sure you put them together so then you know now you have 9 groups what one group out of the 91 ninth you re interested in one group 922 excellent now we re interested in 29s
so how many are in 2 groups of the 9 here how many is in his one group his 2 groups of the 944 where did you get them in your bag
okay so now we re interested in 49s 4 groups of the 91 group 2 groups 3 groups 4 groups
right all right seat we know the rule hand i m not the pied piper right
the pied piper is someone who played the flute or the little recorder and he had all these kids and animals following him that no
work i did this how many groups do you need 1123456 are you paying attention 789 now i see now groups
those now i see 9 groups do one for you you one for you another for you another for you another for you another for you another for you another for you amount yes it s 2 what i need to tell you something later what
i said i need to tell you something later okay that s fine so what you want to do is make sure you have the right amount of groups and you have equal amounts in each group so now we re on to 2 ninths so we have to make groups of 2 no no 9 groups groups here s one group
many 3 no 44 excuse me teacher b what honorable no no one group 2 groups 3 groups how many groups did you say you were interested in
groups do you have 4 groups of the 9 right i think with all the chatter that i m hearing that we are done excellent i do not think i have enough room to sort of divvy them up
hand what is 16th of 1833 and what was 3 sixths of 18 you one ninth of 18 groups one ninth of 18 is
22 excellent 2 ninths of 18 no 2 ninths of 1844 and what is 4 ninths of 18
88 i want to go back to these 3 these last 3 that we did
yes and then 2 ninths of 18 is 4 and then 4 ninths of 18 was 8 sorry some people are playing with their counters sad so we re not going to twirl them
we re not going to spin them and we re certainly not going to stack them we re not going to stack them you so the numerator is getting bigger i thought you said something else doubling so that means the the answers are the answers are getting doubled
one times 2 is 2 excellent now we re ready for the next column
counters you should have exactly 30 counters but just double check before you begin okay so just double check that you have 30 counters check the floor buddy no
let s count 2 4 6 8 10 12 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 19 more okay we do realize that we have tape going and they can hear all of our conversations and i bet if they re not about math they re not going to be happy with us m you may have had s because he was missing one
excellent i think somebody threw one over there that wouldn t be good if they re throwing them anyone short any counters you have one extra okay
set yeah no i m not all set okay the 1st 113rd of 32 thirds of 30 need well let s count them 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 19 20
30 okay okay so 13rd of 30 groups 13rd of 30 how many groups
one group denominator 33 equal groups you re putting 3 in each group
okay 13rd 3 groups look at the denominator 3 groups 123 now deal them out one for you and one for you and one for you
all how many groups 33 groups 123 nope teacher boys and girls the denominator does not mean how many in each group the denominator tells you how many groups
you how many groups right so the denominator is telling you how many groups the numerator is going to tell you how many groups to put together
all good job so you re going to take all this and i think that we need to send you why don t you go over to teacher l s room and do your work
g i m doing my work all right anyone need some help
okay i think i m giving you an extra one groups raise your hand if you need help
here i want to make sure there s an equal amount one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 8 9 10 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 groups and how many groups are we interested in
look at the numerator we re interested in 2 out of the 3 groups 2 so how many are in the 2 groups 10 is in one group
groups didn t i say not to play with them like that we re not going to stack them and we re not going to flip them or twirl them okay got it if there s 10 in one group then there s 10 in another group
20 the next step is 5 groups one 2 3 4 5 sure keep going
and we have one 2 3 4 5 6 one 2 3 4 5 6 one 2 3 4 5 6
amount so we re interested in how many groups out of the 51 so how many is in one group 12 how many is in one group 6 good right how many is in 2 of the 5
12 12 good groups i m going to show you how easy it is to make 6 groups 6 okay we re interested in one of the 6 groups
group and then for the next one you re interested in 3 groups if you will he s going to work on that and you re just going to check and see if he s got it right okay
mind okay next he s working on 3 sixths so just keep an eye out if you will here so she s going to raise her hand and she s going to do we do all of them yes
so turn around and get your own work done
3rd do you know what you re doing no groups don t touch the other ones
groups 7 how many is in one of the 5 groups 6 there you go
groups 2 and 5 groups
one which 13 sixths of 15 you didn t understand that 3 tenths did you understand it or not
groups can we just have maybe 3 or 4 minutes
right excellent i ll be with you in a 2nd so you re interested in 3 of the 6 groups one 2 3 4 5 6
you re interested in 3 of the 6 groups okay one 2 3 eyes on me we re not stacking and we re not twirling those counters thank you for being patient let s go over our problems so we can finish up and wrap up
okay there s one of me and there s 21 of you point i think the majority of you are getting this some of you are just sort of getting a little bit confused about how many groups what am i pushing together
sorry we re going to practice right so let s see what we found we took 30 counters
we broke it into 3 groups and we were interested in one out of the 3 groups so what is 13rd of 3010 we took the same 30 counters groups this time though we were interested in 2 out of the 3 groups anything what is 2 thirds of 30
20 well if one group had 12 groups is going to have 20 20 because 10 times 2 equals 20 good next group 15th of 30 counters we broke them into 5 groups
groups what is 15th of 30 6 well if 15th of 30 is 6 then i had to look at 2 fifths of 30
12 again if 15th of 30 is 62 fifths is going to be 12 12 because 6 times 2 is 12
right next we had to break our groups into sixths 16th of 30 30 counters and 6 groups m 16th of 30 is 5 5 well if i know 16th of 30 is 5 what would 3 sixths of 30 be
151 group of one group is 5 out of the 6
will you close the door when you get a chance you all need one marker please don t get more than one per person okay all right everybody have a seat
hand yes i understand that dry erase eraser may not erase that well so just bear with that there over i m going to try come over here and do this with you all right let s do the review of long division
yesterday long division is as simple as memorizing the people in this family dad mom sister brother rover what was brother each person represents a step in the long division process divide multiply subtract bring down repeat or remainders divide multiply subtract bring down repeat or remainders
and now it s going to take dad is going to divide divide 2 into the 1st number and the dividend 9 write that number directly above the number you divide into which is 44 is this the same thing as no it s a little different
is multiply it s just a different yeah the the 2 times 4 sorry i forgot to change that part so you have the 2 times 4 write your answer directly underneath the 9 of the number you just divided which is 8
subtract draw a line under the 8 write a subtraction sign subtract 8 from the 9 write your answer directly below the 9 which is one review got to review previous content for new content it s a little bit different thank you
i going to have a remainder draw a line under the 8 that s what i do do okay now we re at the point we ve got rover to either repeat or remainder
this is where you decide whether you repeat the 5 steps of the division shh minute i really thought i took the timer off so i m sorry about that
it patience divide divide divide 2 into your new number 14 place your answer directly place your answer directly on the under your quotient 7 subtract multiply multiply multiply your divisor 2 with your number in the quotient 7
place your answer directly under the 14 14 and then sister says to subtract draw a line under the bottom of 14 sign subtract and place the answer under the line 0
arrow number 7 in the dividend bring the 7 down next to the 07 and then we have rover to repeat or remainder if the 2 will divide into your new number 7 then repeat the steps above
here after we subtract what are we going to get one which is what 473 remainder one right so you re going to do great on these problems around the room aren t we did you just change the background i did a couple things okay now we re going to try a few division problems together on your tables
you re going to use the dry erase marker on the table to show and solve your work remember to follow the steps and be sure to work on the table students how many pencils will each student get answer it and then you have to answer also what did you do to solve what are the steps you used to solve it
d so you have to answer it and tell me a b c or d a b c or d do you add then divide i did it
divide that was easy right easy and what s your answer answer is it a b c or d good what did you guys get over here
b b thank you what do you think d okay we have a b c and d over here answer okay it s okay you can a couple minutes all right thank you for waiting quietly
on okay let s not ask that yep all right so everybody what was our answer problem 33 was there any remainders
okay now we re going to try another one so clear your space who wants to read it me suzanne has 70 pencils she gave half of the pencils to her sister and then divided the remaining pencils among her 5 best friends how many pencils did each friend get okay
no she s not her friend she gave half of the pencils to her sister she then no it s not her and she gave it to her friends friends 5 are going to be divided in so that s your dividend divisor sorry 5 divided by 70 divided by 5 correct
1st 0 we have to subtract you divide 1st we divide and then subtract what are you going to divide 1st exactly then you divide that by the 5 friends that she gives them to so that s 35 divided by 5 so it s 7 yes it is 70
35 70 divided by he s not on the same step so just get it written down let me come around and see and then tell me if it s a b c or d a yes okay the answer is 7 it s making it too wet c 0 think again
yes you got it right d up there it s up there i did divide i did divide divide not exactly i divided wait it s not divide divide on that
right it should say divide in half and then you did have to subtract what did you have to subtract well 70 divided by 2 is what right can i scratch out the subtraction but you still had to subtract 70 from 70 cause actually when you do the problem what here
what what huh like this 70 divided by 2 right
10 so you re still having to subtract then 5 times 2 is 10 and subtract again so we did have to divide subtract and now you re going to divide and actually there should be another subtract honestly right
so it would be 2 divide divide subtract divide subtract wait i thought it wasn t asking you like how did you like solve it solve it i was like i m actually glad that it s like this because then i don t have to so what did you choose good yeah you still had to subtract because you knew 2 times 35 is 70 right
so if you did the opposite see how it still would be a as the solution and your answer is 70 is correct okay
wait 7 so we ve got wow a bunch of writing these don t erase this table won t erase we ll clear it after don t worry about it one i know your dry erase boards aren t i mean tables aren t clearing too well
around all right here is about farmer brown has 45 cows farmer green sells him 68 cows farmer brown gives 3 cows to his neighbor got some multi steps going and then divides the remaining cows equally among his barns
how many cars how many cows does he add to each of his barns please ask questions but don t tell us the answer
h it can t be well never mind it can t be a or c because it says farmer green sells 68 cows so you have to add 68 to 450 how many cows does he need does he add to each of his barns
there and everybody seems to be doing the same 1st step so you can eliminate some of those choices because the 1st thing everyone is doing is what property do add add so obviously a and c are not choices
is i have the answer good job you got it good stop with the sounds okay
it i got it how did you get a remainder those are the worst in the world wouldn t the remainder be 2 it is right why did you -0 yeah you forgot to subtract the 3 remember he gave 3 cows to his neighbor
0 wait no he didn t yes he did it i know but she forgot to take the see the 3 cows he gave to his neighbor 0 okay you can go ahead and clean up
b 0 okay it you may clean it you may clean it okay if you need to get we need some more of our wipes tables just as soon as you clean up i m going to go over what you re going to be doing
bring another one up here me okay show me you re ready when you have your tables cleaned up you can put the markers back up and the dry erasers
you re going to have a white piece of paper from your table on the clipboard and you have a pencil in your hand sitting in the chair no one s started yet right now i see is ready and he s already put his name on his paper ready i ve got 2 people ready
paper is ready i mean is ready ready you know that is really not a great choice because people from the county look at it too so you might want to think about your behavior that and don t even get close to that cart
table you know this is a very expensive camera so a lot of people can look at this and a lot of people from gwinnett county look at this on so i have is ready it looks like is ready is ready i m almost ready okay is ready
ready i m waiting for okay well i see a marker still on your table so that s why i was checking now you re going to go around the room and work on individually on the problems again if you re there with a classmate and you want to talk a little bit about the problem you can do that voices remember these guidelines
clipboard walk around the room solve the problems one through 71st in any order work what about 8 number 88 is the game number 8 means you re going to be finished with all the problems and then i m going to show you how to play the partner game which is called loose links with a partner why is that 2 sided 0 okay
so as you are walking around the room please do not bump into the cart at all there is one by the window and the next one is over here so steer clear and be careful use your best behavior and please get up and start solving
begin nice job
well when we have to tell how we got it you mean a b c like those things at the beginning no we need to show our work no a the a b c problem it will ask you each problem problem not like over here
it that you just have to do in your words but i ll put that one up so you can think about divide multiply subtract and bring down but some of the others will give you a multiple choice like this because each problem is different
steps teacher can you come here so would i have 560 divided by 10 for this yes that is correct and then you re going to tell me how did you solve the problem and i m doing it in the number one spot 1st it should be number 2 box
corner i know i know it s number 2 well that will get us all messed up okay since you just started there you go
thank you 0 there so as far as showing your work i don t know why you have to draw the circles but show the division problem so 230 divided by 40 or 560 divided by 10
on this one do we have to explain how we got it it says write your answer in a sentence using words and then use numbers to write the answers as a quotient with a remainder 0 so we don t you do have to write a sentence i did
okay that s a sentence sentence 0 i thought you were talking about a math sentence no like a sentence grammatical correct sentence the there are 5 players are left over
that write the answer as a quotient with a remainder so there are are messed up there are 10 teams divided by with 5 players left over
that s what you should be saying cause here s your answer well go get an eraser dry eraser from the table i messed up so can what did you mess up on like i put 4 where s number 2 where s your number 2 number 2 is right over there 4 no no no that i can t use arrows no because then i ll end up not nope
though guys you have to pay attention to which number you re answering on which box i can t number 3 here see can you help me with this hang on
okay what s your question about number 3 do i do it like this wait a 2nd but i m not sure i can like subtract put a dozen on each plate to sell for $2 a plate
105 so it goes in 8 times right 0 yeah like is harvard watching us like right now like right now seeing us no actually it gets downloaded 0 finish like looking at everyone huh why do they do this anyway they re studying to have more effective teaching of mathematics
when are we going to take a harvard test wait do we have i don t know for awhile i m not sure problem okay what times 8 equals 104 would this work for there are 10 players i thought it was 10 teams
10 yeah 12 times no it s 108 96 yeah so you write the 96 right here right you subtract 96 okay so you ve got 445 kids players 4 teams
6 so there are 10 teams with 5 players left over so you explain it like that job nice quiet asking good questions
got so we had 8 teams 08 plates right yeah and so it s asking full plates which one was this 128 times 28 times $2
how many plates can she make and how many much more just a 2nd dear how much money will she earn for her cupcakes so if she s only selling full plates then that would your your answer is only the full so you really don t use the remainder correct so it would be $16 question you did a good job in hiding the creaky seat you know what kids have moved them around
seat how are you doing head you have to write a complete sentence let s write people sentences okay wait 0 this is multiple choice
okay they need 6 buses okay so the answer is 6 how many buses will they need how did you solve it
steps you re doing a great job there i divided 40 into i divided 40 into 230
back over on the file on the gray cabinet this is for the game yeah when you get finished
how are you guys doing i didn t teacher yes can you help me with how many times 40 goes into 230
huh can you help me with how many times 40 will go into 230
one so yeah can 40 go into pretend the 4 is not there and how many times does 4 go into well 6 times 4 is 24 200 so 55 is your answer here because 5 times 4 is 20 plus a 0 is 200
200 so it s 44 okay so your remainder is going to be 30 40 is that the one with the teams and the bus bus okay so if you re going to have 30 more kids you ve got to put them on a bus so how many buses will you need
right and then you have to answer how you solved it over there choices may i go use the restroom sure set it down at the table for a minute and we ll see you in a little bit
i just have 2 more to go job i have 3 and 7 why don t you tie your shoe think i need help let s see 7 is not the hardest well everybody works a different case quotient 3 37 is the dividend and what is the divisor
okay so 37 so what would be 14th well that s your one over 4 is your remainder then the dividend is 37 then okay so 37 so something times 9 and this look at this
36 36 +one is 37 dividend so that means 9 is your quotient and the remainder is one so therefore your divisor should be the 4
because typically when you do and the problem like here you had 14 divided into 1455 you actually would write it 115 over 14 and that s why it looks like that
0 okay what is the divisor i just have to do 2 and i m done it s all those words right yeah okay so so here is your 37 is the divisor dividend so that s the one underneath the house right the yeah the one underneath the house and this is your answer is 9 with a remainder of one
so what do you what would you multiply 9 to get 4 right and actually it s right there because when you have a remainder you would write the remainder over your divisor papers you can put your clipboards and i ll show you how to play the game
paper you can come over here and i ll show you it will help to just wait for some the next person but i ll show you how to play it okay so you re going to do it on the table with dry erase again okay and what you re going to do and between you and your partner there are 37 tiles in here okay so the 1st person who rolls they re going to divide whatever they roll by 37 or into 37
sorry so i m going to take 5 into 37 which is 7 which is 35 subtract 2 so i get these 2 for my score 0 so you so you re going to your remainder yeah so you have like the 2 of us here but the answer 0 from the other person s so now it s going to be out of 35
0 so the next person is going to have 35 i guess we ll put it over here and so they re going to roll what they re going to divide 35 by which is 2 that it would be 17 remainder one all right 14 15
that s a 7 14 -one so that means this person will get the one but then we re going to subtract that one and the next person has 34 it all right you take away whatever their remainder is from how many so each person each partner gets one no it s between the 2 of you
you however you get down to one or to 0 whoever has the most remainders in their tiles they re the winner what happens if you don t have a remainder you don t get you get 0 and the number will stay the same question so you can start and then there s a the next white 10 is this correct okay just a 2nd knows how to play
me okay i m on my last question what was that question it was there are 145 okay so 0 for 10 teams
on a turtle it s a turtle see the pictures no we re not going to see the pictures game all right if you re done needs a partner and i m going to show okay give me your paper
put it right here and clipboard number 8 is playing a game with a partner so put your paper here put your clipboard and i ll show you how to play the game okay yeah you re going to have show everyone are you going to show it by playing it now i know but to play i m going to show you how to play
okay that would be your put your clipboard up game you need one basket between you and your partner one you can get another one and i ll show you how to play it explain what you re going to do is there s 37 tiles in here
so the 1st person is going to have to divide and that is their dividend divisor so 2 so you re going to have between the 2 of you so this would be me here s you
okay so then you solve the problem how many times does it go in and that s 7 that s 8 that s 16 remainders then the remainder is subtracted from the tiles because now there s only 36 so you will have 36 as your divisor dividend
and then roll the dice and you re going to have to roll so if this was my partner they would take 4 into 36 which is 9 and there s no remainder so nobody gets it stop so i have to go back and get 36 get another one i m going to divide 36 into 6 and i get 6 so 0 it s still 36
working once you get all the tiles out and keep subtracting your remainder from the tiles each basket has okay i get it now off yeah and you can teach them or we well we have enough for an even number so just you can just wait 12nd
there you go fun it s remainders so we only use one basket yeah one basket has 37 tiles for you and your partner
finished yes you ve got to wait until they re finished huh him 0 are there any is there anything on here like yeah and your number is going to change too
see good keep your score on 2 sides though got to keep your score well you re subtract what yeah okay this one confuses me know well that one is your dividend so that s under the house so it s like cutting something okay that s the 37 under the house if you were dividing the answer is 9 with a remainder of one
0 that s a remainder of one yes because you put one as your remainder over your divisor
one okay thank you okay wait 9 remainder one is this what sometimes but it goes like that
i m showing you the 1st person has 37 if you want to keep track of what what you re dividing by remainder one and okay i don t know what it is
okay what are you going to multiply by 9 there will be well you subtract one from 37 and you get 36 right that i wanted to do this because i keep doing addition it gets kind of old
okay you thought what divided by that s 37 divided by 9 with remainder of one no it s 37 divided by 4 and the answer is 9 with a remainder of one yes but you have to figure out that yeah so this is your remainder and actually your divisor is 4
that s what that bottom denominator is 0 no you score it on the table the directions are on the table in the basket and you keep score on the table
i ll play with you if you want remainder into the you said subtract the remainder into the from the tiles
yeah from the 37 and then you get that number and then you roll the dice and then you get that number and there s only why don t you do the 1st one and then you can keep score that way c okay so you re going to take 37 divided by 4 what will be next
so it s going to end up with a remainder of one so he gets one tile 36 now you roll the dice and see what you divide it by divisor so you re going to have 36 divided by 4 wait how do you start off
i ll show you in just a 2nd so he s not going to get a remainder so you re going to start with 0 i already know that okay then now has 36 here so whoever is going to go 1st 37 is your dividend and you roll the dice to see what you re going to divide it by
1st so then you work the problem 11 remainder remainder one yeah so he gets one tile and then you are going to start with 36 because 36 is your number that s your dividend and you roll the dice and solve the problem if you get any remainders that s how you keep score okay
it s everywhere all right i m just going to take a minute real quick guys while you finish up up some of you are still in the middle of a game or just starting that s fine
we ll get a chance to play some more tomorrow and if you haven t had a chance to play you will get to play we still have a few minutes wins teacher now we re not finished i just kind of want to do a okay the dividend is what s being divided into it so that s inside the house yes whoever has the most tiles
so now he s got number 35 it i know did you already finish it 0 no i was just kind of reviewing with it
i finally made it to 8 i just wanted them to know that they ll still get to play and you guys can keep playing we don t have to clean up that s okay i just finished okie doke thank you
i ll show you
all right this morning we need to quickly kind of go over homework before we get our groups started out we are on workbook page 2.3 which is pw 9 down at the bottom even if you didn t finish or you turned in your homework pass we still need you involved
it we need to do this fairly quickly so that we have enough time for groups today okay all right and if you guys would come up to the board quick get a couple more markers our markers keep disappearing all right you will do number 3 for me
you will do number 4 would you please put your hands down over no 2.3
okay it goes right along with the lesson we were working on 2.3 which is pw 9 down at the bottom how come you didn t do the homework i didn t know we had any okay when we have math 1st thing in the morning that is the whole point of using that agenda is to write it down so you don t forget you are you using your agenda correctly yes you got mom or dad signing it at night
do okay so maybe say hey mom and dad i am having a hard time can you help me get the homework finished and use that agenda okay just do the best you can sometimes when i clean my board the chemicals make it hard to see
no all right thank you all right let us look at number one
look at how they lined up the decimals and that is the key there when you are adding or subtracting decimals you have to line it up 2.7 +one one comes out 3.8 number 2 we had digits in the thousandths place
10.973 if we read that correctly that is 10 and 973 thousandths okay okay you should ve gotten 58.63
and number 4 same thing they lined it up a little crooked here 26.81 excellent you you will do number 5 if you will do number 6 number 7 if you will do number 8 do not get upset
okay you might want to leave it in your notebook since it has holes don t tear it out or you will lose it cause remember we save these so that you got something to study by when we take before we take the test
okay do not forget to put the number by it so we know which one it is good job
you doing all right this morning say no actually yes hold on okay all right okay you are making me think today too cause i am having to really check finished all right look at number 5 we had 3 numbers again
again the person who did number 5 had to line it up
yes i will get you one in just a minute number 7 27.02 us if we were writing that in word form that would be 2 hundredths not 2 tenths well we have 11.329
turn so if you have not had a turn raise your hand all right you will do number 9 number 10 number 11 number 12
energy don t forget to put the number by your problem erase the board hm
straight to me remember the poem you used to tell me
what was it to write with a broken pencil is pointless remember that yeah i remember that always have your pencil sharp ready for math i actually never use pen when you are doing this never it is hard to do math with pen
back okay take a minute go back and take the whole notebook and that way you will not have to come back to class and disrupt us
you can i erase the board again not yet
okay while she is finishing that one for us raise your hand and tell us is there a strategy that you used that helps to make these easier used i just added you just added okay
else nope all right if you were going to explain this to someone in maybe 2nd or 3rd grade what would be the 1st thing that you would tell someone s line up the decimal line up the decimal when do we line up decimals what kind of problems subtraction and addition addition and subtraction all right so real quick let us look
here we have 34.21 14.428 number 11 they kind of messed us up we went from all addition now all of a sudden we have got subtraction and sometimes they do that to us on purpose because they are hoping they can mess you up
up you should gotten 6.25 and number 12 again we have a subtraction this time 9.8 -2.3 is 7.5 turn if you will do number 13 and number 14 us we will move on to our groups all right
that doesn t work we will grab one off of the board okay thank you
there shouldn t it be 8 because 11 +6 is which one number okay 8 +2 is 10 +2 is 12 carry the one 4 +one 4 +one is 5 equals 10
head that is why i said you should check your work 13 number 13 was subtraction this one and we actually had to borrow and that was part of our $1000000 project was learning to subtract and borrow and go across zeroes we should gotten 5.44
okay and number 14 again you can see that she had to borrow several times 3.192 point a minute ago we were off by one number it and i was doing them in my head right now but when you do them in your head sometimes you don t catch those mistakes so always go back and make sure you show your work and check over it okay
now we will finish grading this later i will make sure that you have it accurate but for right now i need you to close it and put it on the corner of your desk today one group will be working on accelerated math most of you are getting past all the review aks and are getting into multiplying and dividing decimals which is our goal for the next couple of weeks
so if you do accelerated math today please again show that work circle in the right answer make sure your card is correct when you are ready to score if you will just set it right here on top of this computer we will get that scored for you and print you out your new one okay we will have a group in the back working on success maker math your goal is try to get an 80 or higher on your session
and you might get problems that we had last year or you might get some 6th grade problems i encourage you to use your scratch paper and really work those problems out and then today we ll have one group with me when we are exploring how to write and how to read decimals we might even do some addition and subtraction
right yesterday we had all the gentleman on ncs so i need 123455 ladies 1st 5 ladies and you are back on ncs
okay and can you come back here we have got you working and we got you working on accelerated math please don t forget to use your scratch paper and show the work
is so gentlemen and you 2 may move across the room because we are going to use your desks for our small group today chair we are going to circle we are going to circle right around is desk right if you are having any computer problems please let me know
okay please remember your manners and behavior we all right i am going to put you right there just leave your chair and sit right here because we have already got your chair
us dump them let us see we need 3 blue and 3 red right now hm okay put it in your pocket right now so it doesn t distract us
okay quickly go put it in our bucket we will just take a couple of these out jar use all of them nah we just want a couple for right now okay one of the problems that i am noticing is we are not understanding how to read and write decimals now these are decimal dice
if you look the red ones say tenths the blue ones say ones so that is our whole number and then 0 that is the difference yes you got all the decimals these are called decimal dice so what we are going to do just leave them leave them right there for right now okay so i am going to please wait i am going to demonstrate 1st and then i will break you up into partners
what you are going to do is you are just going to roll a number 10s and i got 9 what does that say minute how would we build that if this is our models i know you said what we don t have any whole numbers right no so how many would we need here
need 5 more okay do we have anything in that hundredths no this equivalent decimal is 9090 so technically we could put a 0 here to hold our place cause 9 tenths is the same thing as saying that we have 90 out of this 100 score
remember equivalent decimals all right if we lined it up like that you would only have one space we only have 110th and not filled in or shaded in so 90 hundredths is the same things as 9 tenths why would they make them different colors so you could see it and show up okay so 9 tenths
so what you are going to do is you and your partner are going to roll the dice and then you are going to build it onto your board okay so let us get in a good habit of building it onto your board and then we are going to do something with those numbers all right i am going to let you 2 have that board you and slide down
together and you and i are working together why is 1st of all that who is you mean
on tenths i know they are all different so that is when you roll you really read it us 9 wait what did you get so 9 right here and 7 tenths no we did 9 it is 90
we need the ones so is that 10 or tenths 110th so we need one all right remember each of the ones
ones huh okay and there is the tenths how many do we need 712345 do we have enough 67 now how would you read it
one and 7 tenths one and 7 tenths i am bad about saying one.7 but it is one and 7 tenths okay so you have 9 wait a minute did you read this correctly yeah it said 991s okay again we are done with this read it to me
9 and 9 and 9 and 59 and 5 tenths excellent you can borrow 2 all right roll again you did
it i didn t get a 7 need 2 of them 2 no wait that was 9 and 6 tenths that was tenths no it was 9 ninths so you have 2 it 2 and 3 tenths excellent play around with that for just a few more minutes i ll be right back ladies how we doing over here
good everybody is computer is working all right yes okay how do you do this again okay this is an exponent
this is called repeated multiplication what is 3 times 3 transfer no wait 3 times 33 times 99 so that is what that means that s how many times you multiply 33 times 3
if it was 3 to the 3rd power it would be 3 times 3 times 3 so it is 99 now i get it
board and this time we are working together thank you we are working together because the problem is we are not understanding word form and expanded form
is right here so we have to write in expanded and will you grab 2 more white boards right there at the bottom do we have to write in expanded form or what yes and that is what we are having a hard time so let us add where would you put the hundredths dice do not we need 3 nope all right take the dice that you have roll us a number
easy all right tell us your number mine one and 85 hundredths okay you and your partner 1st build it it write on this they are all different they are all different i got it
ones and the little pieces are the hundredths that we gave you a little clue right here like that why did they get the one with the sharpie you are supposed to be building it too so go ahead and build it
one and 85 hundredths thank you one and 85 hundredths are we all supposed to be building that yep i need you to help me build it on this board how do you build one and 85 hundredths who wrote 85 here but wait this is where you are thinking
like visually what would one and 85 hundredths look like 850 so it is not as bad as you think is it now it would be really bad if i made you get 85 of these wouldn t it
85 this is where we are getting confused one and 85 hundredths so how many you need here 5 you need 5 right there and 8 in the pennies 8 in the tenths it is 85 not 80 now on your white board i need you to write that in word form where did my marker go
probably fell on the ground on your board i need you to write it in word form yes that is part of math it should just be numbers you are not with us a i am going to ask you one more time
stop i need you to write it in word form one and 85 hundredths one and 85 hundredths what does that look like on word form okay do we have to write the point are we supposed to show it to you how do you write the point in word form
and can it be one and 85 hundredths really really it why would you draw that we can also compare ours to what how did you know that was what we are going to do
now real quickly before you erase it what would that look like if we wrote it in expanded form board on your board what would that look like in expanded form i know what it looks like one +point no no
us show us got one +5 +.03 you did a different number all right but where did you get that number from 0 that is a one
okay if that was a one that makes sense all right so right i was right you forgot your decimal right there now kind of beat us to it this time with your partner your partner is going to roll a number number you are going to write in word form and then you are going to compare who has the higher number
hm do we have to write it in expanded form actually we can just do standard form since we are running out of time yay standard form so just write it in standard form and compare are they equal less than or greater than yes
dice trying to find you you and i are comparing all right so you should have a one a tenths and a hundredths now
10s that is why all right roll we are not spinning the dice we are rolling them
math we can focus now or we can do this during recess today hm i thought you were rolling 1st you roll 1st i roll 1st i got 28s and a 51s tenths hundredths there we go
it 512345 if we need more i got a box back here with extras yes madam all right do you remember how to score it that should be up and ready thank you that s number 8 so what are we building
5 and what 6 tenths 123456 number now don t forget to build your number board that helps you also in comparing with your neighbor you got plenty of materials behind us now i am rolling all right automatically who has got the higher number
the ones in the ones spot okay compare write your number dude write your number do not copy me did you roll yours yeah is yours larger or smaller
his mine was 5 it done and it ll print out your new 15 and 63 hundredths man you already won you have more ones man yeah
sense i have to write it in expanded no me all right so who is is larger who is is larger all right if you were if this was an essay question how would you explain that yours is larger than his
cause the ones in the hundredths the ones place but hey okay where is your number that s his number 0 see i thought okay i was going to say i thought you were trying to tell me both of those were this one was larger when they are both the same okay now my number is bigger than your number now
yay the ones is bigger now that makes sense he has got you have more in the ones spot again different number rolling keep building numbers keep exploring that s supposed to be a nice okay roll me
go build that for me it yep build it for me and i ll be right back what did you make then you go back and try another one ahead we got about 5 more minutes keep going till we tell you to stop do not forget to be using that scrap paper
one okay if you look at what this says all right look at how far you have gotten on the computer with the objectives you started off with place value you ve gotten all the way now we are up to multiplication division now you have 4 problems that you had a different answer than the correct answer so i need you to go back over those 4 problems real quick and just correct your mistakes
all right was it a mistake on the card or do you understand what happened understand all right so now we will pick you a new one what we will do is look at your next aks we are estimating sometimes this gives us a hard time
one ah is i had the wrong number okay here is your next one yeah because that pushes you through so that you don t have to spend a lot of time on the ones you already know
with okay so doing master is tests are good things same you got a new card so you are going to use the backside of that card for you to score
all right okay okay all right well this is elapsed time so you are going to have to look jesse is living in los angeles
miami so you have to use this chart take a guess okay gentlemen gentlemen volume way down okay i need you are stupid excuse me me you need to think about i am not saying crap
stop okay right now this is the reason that math is difficult because our attention is not staying on task erased would you grab a tissue box so we don t have to use our hands right there on our desk is that the purpose of this
what is the purpose of this lesson to learn back in there the thing is okay this is a skill that we as 5th graders should already know then you are not proving it on paper
scores all right this time i need your marker in your hand
hm thank you all right just throw all the pieces right here in the box
whiteboards and our markers and your markers you just need your marker and your whiteboard you got your whiteboard erased
floor i know i brought extras okay i am ready to start
put that right back thank you i don t know why these are not mixing today here we go on your board i need you to build 9 and 76 hundredths you mean write it
it 9 and what 9 and 76 hundredths that s way too big
on now i need you to 8 and 73 hundredths 8 and 73 hundredths done i am done that is a 7 if it is a 7 you got to make it look like one
and this one is that a 4 or a 9 i am seeing 2 different 3 different answer here answers all right let us start with the ones what is 9 +817 wait
do where am i supposed to start when we are adding new adjustments the hundredths place what is 6 +39 right everybody has got 9 in the hundredths place yeah let us add the tenths what is 7 +714 you got the wrong number down it you put down the 4 for the ones and carried the 10
so now we have got 10 +8 which is 18 18.49 all right okay erase it go again we got 9 and 73 hundredths wasn t that the 1st one though no
i rolled it twice what is the chances all right +3 and 96 hundredths add that back 60 what hundredths 3 and 96 hundredths done
person excellent all right 3 and 96 hundredths here we go i just started i know i am watching you
3 and 77 hundredths 3 and 77 hundredths 6 and 27 hundredths 6 and 27 hundredths add or subtract add okay excellent now catch up with us
okay much better 76 again it is not that you don t know how to add numbers go back and check your work here is what i need off we will do this again and this week we will also be doing some multiplication and division with decimals
need boards wiped off and hand your board to so can put them up box i need you at your desk with a piece of paper okay all right quickly by the time i count to 10 all right my accelerated math group please make sure your papers are back in their folder i need you at your desk with a piece of paper ready to go
need please hit escape i made a 90 excellent okay but when i am with group please make sure you are not interrupting us directions we just said escape and then leave them up for a teacher a is class is going to borrow these off i need you at your desk with a piece of paper and pencil
stop escape i need you at your desk with a piece of paper and pencil okay everybody we need a pencil and a piece of paper
your desk is up here quickly please
would you let sorry math folders back in our box you wait let us go quickly quickly we are running out of time desk quickly quickly ladies that means you too please
eyes on me at your desk pencil paper ready ready okay we are ending our lesson today no matter what you did in your group you have an essay question for me that has to be finished before we leave
your question for me for your math journal how would you explain how to add and subtract decimals to a younger student entry how would you explain how to add and subtract decimals to a younger student
knowledge use the vocabulary that we have been learning this week tenths hundredths ones tenths okay think about how would you explain what a decimal is show off your math knowledge today you are answering that question how would you explain how to add and subtract decimals to a younger student okay make sure you have 1st name last name on your paper
and remember when you are answering a question in 5th grade how many sentences should it be at least 55 at least anywhere from 3 to 5 or 3 to 8 is a good paragraph paragraph how would you explain it to someone younger you can include an example in your you can include your example in your explanation
too you may go ahead and go
our homework tonight is 2.4 in your practice book i forget that you guys aren t in our homeroom don t get a chance to write that down how would you explain adding or subtracting decimals to a younger student
for those students who are not in my homeroom class please do not forget to write down your homework we want you to do 2.4 which was the back of last night is all right when you are done with your essay if you will hand it in and we will see you tomorrow
you can come on in today good good got your homework written down
i did do you want to see what we wrote yes
in finished an example you can you don t have to but you can all right hm how many sentences a good paragraph is usually 3 to 8 sentences here it is
all right take a minute write down your homework and we will see you tomorrow thank you madam okay you all can come in all right let us think about this a little more and get a little more down on paper
okay for those of you that are just coming in please take a minute organize your math materials down you may start on it while you are enjoying your snack if you have teacher 0 or teacher i didn t actually get to finish that s all right i can give that back to you tomorrow and you can finish it up if you have teacher 0 or teacher d please don t leave me till you turn your paper in
or i will come get you during team time name all right do i have your essay turn it in it during lunch i can come get you during lunch that would be fine
the day before that we talked about making equivalent fractions and we said that we make equivalent fractions to compare fractions we make equivalent fractions in order to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators we make equivalent fractions in order to simplify fractions doing
using the lcd meaning what mean the least common denominator least common denominator so when we make equivalent fractions are we using the lcd yes what does it mean to make an equivalent fraction 5 do not move again teacher do not move again
to try to make the fraction equal to try to make equal fractions and why do we need to make equal fractions so we can add and subtract so we can add and subtract fractions without doing what changing the denominator without changing the value of the fraction
so that is why we make equivalent fractions when we have unlike denominators that is why we make equivalent fractions when we want to compare fractions to see which is greater which is less
right we are going to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators so if i say to you 3 fourths +15th equals what is the 1st thing that you need to do what is the 1st thing that you notice or that you know about this that they have different denominators that they have different denominators i need you to raise your hand okay
so with there being different denominators move that up move your chair so that you can see so with there being different denominators what do move those crutches and come sit over here you cannot add 2 fractions because they do not have the same denominator all right so what is it that you have to do c you have to make the fractions what
yes so now we have to make an equivalent fraction of 3 fourths where the denominator is 20
so what whole fraction or whole can we multiply 3 fourths by to get an equivalent fraction with the denominator being 20 5 5 over 5 how do we say that fraction 5 fifths 5 fifths so we can multiply 3 fourths times 5 fifths which will give us what
15 twentieths 15 twentieths because we are multiplying by one whole the value of 3 fourths has or has not changed
to it has not changed so 3 fourths is equal to 15 twentieths why we need to do this is because we have to make sure that our denominators are the same so that we can do what so then we can so that we can what
add so now we need to make an equivalent fraction of 15th that has a denominator of 20 so that we can add so that we can complete our problem and add
so what whole can we multiply 15th by to get a denominator of 20 d 4 fourths 4 fourths 4 times one is what 4 so now 15th is equal to what 4 twentieths so 15th is equal to 4 twentieths now we can add
so 3 fourths +15th equals 2 15 twentieths +4 twentieths so now are we able to add now why because why because why yes you do know
you because why i was not paying attention well i need you to pay attention so why can we add it now because because the denominators are the same because the denominators are the same a because the denominators because the denominators are the same so with that being said 15 twentieths +4 twentieths equals what
a what was the question 15 twentieths +4 twentieths equals what
look 15 twentieths +4 twentieths equals what let us go
so now we understand that when we are trying to get common denominators to add and subtract fractions that we need to multiply by a whole to 1st get an equivalent fraction so that we can then add or subtract now remember i said that use equivalent fractions to also simplify right
yes so what if you had 2430 sixths and you were asked to simplify that fraction
l simplify means that you got the smallest form okay to reduce to the smallest form to make it into the smallest form simplify tell me how you use your knowledge of equivalent fractions to simplify how do you use your knowledge of equivalent fractions to simplify
how do you use your knowledge of equivalent fractions to simplify n the multiples the multiples what about the multiples you have to give me a complete sentence please to come out to 2430 sixths okay go what operation are you doing okay so you are dividing
so you know that you need to divide by what a multiple that can go into both remember we are talking about equivalent fractions and your knowledge of equivalent fractions to simplify so you are right you have to divide and you know that you need to divide but how does knowing about equivalent fractions help you to simplify
next it helps you simplify because when you do your division and multiplication you will have a better chance of getting the right answer okay you have a better chance of getting the right answer how does it help you what helps you leave me alone how does your knowledge of equivalent fractions help you to simplify
0 it helps you to simplify because you know the steps and stuff okay so 1st tell me what happens when you multiply by one you get the same answer you get the same answer what happens when you get the same number one you get the same number so whenever you multiply or divide by one you get the same number
so when you are making equivalent fractions and you have to multiply or divide by one whole part of something are you changing the value of the fraction no no so when you are simplifying by one whole part and what do i mean by one whole part
k one whole part 5 sixths 5 sixths so when you are simplifying or dividing by one whole part you are not changing the value of the fraction so your knowledge of equivalent fractions when you are simplifying is that you are reducing it you are making it to its smallest terms without changing how much it is worth
value so you are making it the smallest that you can make it without changing what it is worth so tell me what whole part would you divide 2430 sixths by 4 why are you yelling out in order to make it the smallest fraction possible 3 i need to hear from somebody different
3 is that the 3 what just the number 3 a whole 3 correct 6
3 thirds 3 thirds let us do 3 thirds okay let us do 3 thirds excuse me 3 now have we reduced this is it smaller
smaller have we simplified it to its lowest term no
be no we have not done that because 8 twelfths can still be reduced right so what can you divide 8 twelfths by in order to get its lowest term you have to divide 4 fourths 4 fourths 8 divided by 4 equals 2
12 divided by 42 thirds so what is our answer 2 thirds 2 thirds yes i know but i went with what brianna did because we know what we know about equivalent fractions which is what
it is the it does not change they are equal changed we can say that 2430 sixths is equal to 2 thirds so if comes up and says you know what
i have a bag of marbles and i have to give 2 thirds of my marbles and she gives it to her and comes and he says well i have a bag of marbles too
i am going to give her 2430 sixths of my marbles knows that since they are equivalent that they are both giving her the same amount of marbles it is just what is the difference
what pieces pieces this fraction has more pieces and the pieces are what bigger bigger all right so what we have please stop talking is 4 fifths equal into is 4 fifths equal then to 2 thirds and yeah that is a question
so let us see if 4 fifths is equivalent to 2 thirds because remember i said one reason why we learn about equivalent fractions is to compare fractions so comparing them means figuring out whether they are greater than less than or equal to
so your question was comparing 4 fifths and what 2 thirds yes all right so if we went with the multiples of the denominator 5 5 10 15 3 6 9 12 15 all right so our common denominator is what
15 so we will start with 4 fifths 1st 4 fifths times what whole part will give me a denominator of 153 thirds 3 thirds all right 4 times 3 is what
12 okay so now we go to 2 thirds 2 thirds times one whole part will give me 15 for the denominator 5 fifths 5 fifths thank you
10 so now we have 12 fifteenths and 10 fifteenths so looking at 12 fifteenths and 10 fifteenths what can you say about those they are not equal greater than less than or equal to
than 12 fifteenths is greater than 10 fifteenths so what can you say about 4 fifths and 2 thirds they are less than 12 fifteenths is greater than 10 fifteenths 12 fifteenths is the same as which one of these 4 fifths or 2 thirds 4 fifths 4 fifths 10 fifteenths is the same as what
2 thirds so what can you say about 4 fifths and 2 thirds 4 fifths is equal to 12 fifteenths it is equal but what can you say about these 24 fifths is greater than 2 thirds so that is how you could figure that out by using equivalent fractions to help you figure it out
all right i need for i am going to give you a worksheet i want you to do i need you to do a
d you can move to table number 4
you are doing d come on 9 tenths -one half so what is the 1st thing you have to do find an equivalent fraction okay you have to find the equivalent fraction but you also need to one half they both have to have the same what
denominator they both have to have the same denominators so what do you need to do you need to look at the multiples right yes all right do that please one minute and 20 seconds b is done b
a and you should not be writing in pen you should not be writing with pen in math
and yes it is okay table 3 you are doing letter c
but we are asking you do we do a 6 sixths or 3 thirds you are trying to make a denominator of 6 so you have to do one half times because you have to multiply why wouldn t it be 3 thirds 6 times 2 is 12 what times 2 will give you 6
3 all right you have 30 seconds now but in order to do equivalent fractions do not you have to divide or multiply by a whole 1st yeah
over table 3 the conversation is over talking all right table one what is your answer 2 eighths okay yes so is 2 eighths the smallest or the lowest no
okay so then i need to come back to table number it is 14th it is 14th all right table number 2 b what is your answer 112th 112th table c what is your answer is that simplified table 2 you are being rude
it is simplified 2 sixths at 1st it was 3 sixths okay if at 1st it was 3 sixths and you simplified it 16th equals 2 sixths 3 sixths -one sixths equals 2 sixths table one you guys do not be rude
rude 3 sixths -16th is 2 sixths but is that fraction in lowest term i will come back to you table number 4 what is the answer 4 tenths 4 tenths is it simplified
it table 3 you ready for your answer 13rd so 2 sixths simplified equals a fraction is 13rd what was your 1st answer 4 tenths 4 tenths and the simplest form is 2 fifths 2 fifths did you say that
right so the next one i am going to give you that was subtracting this one is adding d table number 2 do c
b table number 4 do a
and you have 2 minutes you are doing c
so what whole part did you divide 8 fifteenths by in order to get 4 fifths cause you had to divide it by a whole part so that means that you had to divide it by a fraction where the numerator and denominator were the same so is 8 fifteenths the simplest form no that is why i simplified it to okay
so what are you dividing 8 fifteenths by 2 can 2 go into 15 evenly no because you have to divide it by 2 halves so can 3 go into 8 evenly
because it would have to be 3 thirds so is 8 fifteenths already in its simplest form 23 fourths 3 fourths so tell me walk me through
walk me through the least common denominator is denominator is 4 off table 4 i need you to pay attention please the least common denominator is 4
so one half times 2 halves equals 2 fourths 14th times one so do you even need to do that no
all right thank you very much homework i am getting ready to give you a bingo sheet yes how this works is the bingo is equivalent fractions
these are the fractions that you have to choose from to put on your bingo board everybody is going to have 2 bingo boards so we are going to play twice
boards there are not as many going down as going across so the only way that you can get bingo is going across why can not we get it down because there are only 3
so the only way you can get bingo is going across so you have one minute to put your fractions in your spaces from look up here decided which fractions you want put them in the space
all of them are not going to fit in the 1st board
so how this is going to work if i call a fraction for example one half and you have 2 fractions on your board on your one board that would be equivalent to one half you can only mark one so you will have to wait until i call one half again in order to mark the other one
and how we are going to mark it is you are just going to put an x over the square that is the equivalent fraction do the 2nd board as well please and then we do not have to spend time after the 1st game doing the 2nd board you want us to do them both yes no you can choose different numbers if you want
it does not matter because when you play bingo and some people play with one card some people play with 2 i mean you can use some of the same fractions
fine can we make up our own fractions if you want to take that chance because if you make up your own fractions that means that there is a possibility that i might not call one that is equivalent to it so that is a chance that you take okay no you may not i can not no
well you told she can asked if she could put one on her board chart you can put one on the board all right so you have 10 seconds to finish your 1st board cause your 1st board should be done
if you would like to write your name on this that is fine please remember that you are looking for equivalent fractions
okay here we go i will say these for the 1st board
16th 16th you are going too fast i am only going to tell you one
if you divide 9 twelfths by 3 thirds you get 3 fourths i already know how to divide that you have to be able to do that this is what we have been studying equivalent fractions dividing by a whole then that is something different than saying that you do not know how to do it i am speaking
talking telling me i am going too fast is different than saying that you do not understand so the very 1st one was 3 fourths anybody that has 9 twelfths on your board you should have that one crossed off for 3 fourths i gave it to you
the next one i said was one half look on your board look for a fraction that is equivalent to one half it however you are going to mark it but i need for you to actually stop talking
you either have 9 twelfths or you have 3 fourths so you have to wait till i call it again to mark it a 2nd time
yes is not 2 fourths equal to one half yes all right next fraction one half 1st board because he did not have bingo
so the next fraction is one half remember i said some of them i would have to call twice because you might have it on your board twice
next fraction bingo you have bingo okay 2 twelfths 2 twelfths is equal to what 16th equal to 16th okay 2 fourths 2 fourths is equal to
he won the 1st round all right so you know what it is almost our social studies time so we are not going to go and play the 2nd game
focus i need you focused we are going back the reason we tried understand we make it a point to understand equivalent fractions is why
to make the fraction equal to make the fraction equal but why is it important that we are able to make fractions equal why is it important that we are able to make equivalent fractions and that we understand how we do that to make it easier for us to read to make it easier for us to read and simplify
else what is another reason why we need to make equivalent fractions what is another reason we need to make equivalent fractions so we know how to read fractions we already said we do
you need equivalent fractions so you know how like if you are using it for something okay i just need one sentence one simple sentence talking we already said we make equivalent fractions
we need to know how to make equivalent fraction so that we can make fractions simplified so that we can reduce so that they are easier to work with what are some other reasons why we need to understand how to make equivalent fractions c so we can add so we can add fractions with with like denominators with like denominators or unlike with unlike denominators what is another reason
so we can subtract them so that we can subtract what unlike fractions so that we can subtract unlike fractions what is another reason that we need to understand and be able to make equivalent fractions
d i know but i need you focused i need you paying attention can you answer the question
attention so what about comparing fractions adding and subtracting fractions comparing fractions because we already said adding and subtracting so comparing fractions
you okay let me tell you this 1st of all your geometry project that s due friday part a make sure you keep your sheet because we re going to cycle back to geometry after that and we re going to talk to you about how to do part b of your project
a we re going to be flipping over to measurement we re going to be doing a whole unit on measurement like customary length metric length we re going to be talking about area today we re going to be talking about customary length and metric length if you would open your books to page 410
let me get a volunteer let s see student will you come help pass out these him everybody one of those
ahead actually i want you to close your books 1st
finished yeah okay let s see how much you know on your customary length whiteboard who doesn t have one me a whiteboard who has that little easel from back there
whiteboard no one s using that it s right there 0 it here get that and then let s see that and then do you still not have a whiteboard
here you and share that and then we ll give that to because that can open up
whiteboard 0
3 feet equals 5280 feet equals and then 1760 yards equals
i want to see 12 feet i mean 12 inches equals student one foot one foot that 3 feet equals what student one yard
one yard most people got that 5280 feet equals what student a mile one mile good hold your i m not seeing some of your boards i m sorry very nice
job and 1760 yards equals what student one mile one mile
what fill it in 1st 0
do you already have yours i have one i can use
no wait i have mine you have your ruler a ruler yeah all right 10 millimeters 10 millimeters 1st of all look on your ruler
rulers you want to turn it over on the side actually it has right here those are those tiny tiny the smallest unit of measure on the metric side where it says you have an inch side this is the metric side
right a lot of you got this right i got it right but so 10 millimeters is equal to
one centimeter one centimeter 100 centimeters is going to be equal to meter one meter and 1000 meters is going to be equal to
what student one kilometer one kilometer yay kilometer is close to what
me okay student the smaller the unit the measurement will be okay so the smaller the unit of measurement the more precise it is going to be
what are some things you can use to measure some thing with tape a measuring tape student sometimes you can use your hands to measure okay
but if i want to get a precise measurement student computer what s this called stick a yard stick a meter stick but that s not it
okay or if you are like driving a distance you could use what gps miles miles miles but what calculates the miles in a car called gps something gps no
0 student odometer odometer 411 what are you going to measure what unit of measure would you use to measure the width of a shoe student a ruler a ruler but what unit
that all right what about the height of a roof student boys let s pay attention stick or and you re going to measure it in what
meter well it s going to be measured in yards or you can measure it in what miles not miles meters think you re going to measure the height of this room in miles feet feet what about the distance between the school and your home
what you told me earlier odometer odometer turn to page look on the top of page 412 precise now what did they say the smaller the unit of measurement the what
the smaller the thing more precise it is inches feet feet feet feet hands up marker which one would you say is smaller inches or feet
inches inches is going to be smaller feet are going to be bigger bigger what about feet and yard feet feet are smaller yards are longer who can raise their hands and tell me student feet is smaller yard is bigger feet is smaller yard is bigger
mile student yards are smaller mile is bigger smaller bigger okay what about in the metric system you have millimeters to centimeters which one do you think is bigger
millimeters or centimeters millimeter millimeters is what bigger bigger let s look at our ruler here for a 2nd ruler everybody turn to your ruler and look at your ruler where it says where it has the little millimeters that s your metric side the tiny you see those little baby baby lines on there
i don t know if mine has it it doesn t you re going to have to look on with student yours has it see it says centimeter those tiny tiny lines
dime those are millimeters you see that yeah so which one is bigger centimeters or millimeters centimeters centimeters is bigger millimeters is smaller what about centimeters to meters student centimeters to meters which one is bigger you think
centimeters or meters meters meters is bigger centimeters are smaller what about meters to kilometers student kilometers bigger right smaller okay thanks okay looking at the top so the smaller the unit of measure the more precise it s going to be
so looking at the top of page 412 which one do you think is the more precise measurement one foot or 13 inches one foot or 13 inches student one foot now the smaller the unit the measure like we re talking inches to feet on this they re the same thing right one foot 12 inches
is 12 inches 13 inches is one foot and one inch measurement 13 inches 13 inches what about 2 miles or 10565 feet precise i m on number 6 on the top of page 412
remember the smaller the unit of measure the more precise it is meaning the more exact it is student 10565 feet good what 5 feet or 2 yards student 5 feet 5 feet good
34 inches or one yard student one yard student 34 inches okay we re talking about inches what was that question yard so the inches is smaller than yards right
yes give me a thumbs up if are inches smaller than yards yes way smaller than yards yes so inches are more precise than yards that look at your ruler really quick
side this is one inch here one inch what one yard a foot this is one foot
so the smaller unit of measure the more precise it is look at number 9 it says 12 one 4 feet to 12 one 8 feet those they re both talking about feet what do you have to do to compare them common denominator common denominator very good
some of you are looking like you re a deer in the headlights like you don t even know fractions anymore 0 so which one is going to be smaller 12 one 4 or 12 one 8 student 12 and an 8th very good number 10 it says 35 3 8 inches or 3 feet
student 35 and 3 8 inches very good going down to number 18 i want you to take out your whiteboards
minute which one is more precise on number 182 miles or 3526 yards 182 miles or 3526 yards
2 miles think about which one is the smaller unit of measure board which one are smaller yards or miles precise 3526 yards okay good job
feet student 4 yards which one is smaller feet what about 26320 feet or 5 miles stduetn 26320 feet good job
21 student what did you say good 22 student student thriteen 1000 feet good job
and 23 student one foot which one is smaller inches or feet okay you have got to think about the unit of measure which one is smaller 11 give that marker right there in your book where you need to measure
inch take a ruler out you need it on your inch side i want you to complete 11 through 14 measuring to the nearest inch it s going to ask you to the half inch to the 8th of an inch and write your answers down on your whiteboard
raise your hand if you need help measuring we re right here
the next one you re going to measure to the half inch and then to the closest 8th of an inch okay let me show you here
pencil okay you see these right here you see these you re counting 8 and you know 1828384858 and when you get 8 8 you should be at one inch right
so you ve got 2345 so you ve got right here see we ll make a little mark 18th 2 8 3 8 4 8 4 8 should be your half mark right
what one half one half so that s a half 5 eighths 6 8 7 8 8 8 so it is the 2nd line in from the 00 and then those smaller lines are your 16th of an inch you re 8th inch mark who can tell me where that is
and then the 2nd line it s the 2nd line in from the 0 and if you count it you go one 8 2 8 3 8 4 8 sshould be your what equal a half a half so it should be your half inch marhc 5 86 8 on up should to 8 8 would equal what
whole so on number one on that 1st on well technically it s number 11 it says to the nearest inch hwat student 33 inches
when you measure to the nearest half inch what do you get student 3.53.5 and when you measure it to the nearest 8th of an inch
one do you all remember where the 8th inch mark is yeah you have your 0 and then a little line that s bigger
is so this would be like your one 8 and then antoher mark 2 8 3 8 4 8 3 8 4 8 way you keep on going on up to one
so 5 eighths running out of room 7 eighths and at your 8 8 mark that is what
is one whole one whole so when you measure number 13 to the nearest 8th of an inch what do you get student 3 and 3 8
good okay so i ve marked off my eighths these little lines are going to be my what
student sixteenths sixteenths like one 16 2 16345678910 11 12 13 14 15 16 that that would be sixteenths if it said measure it to your nearest sixteenths so 16 over 16 is equal to one whole
one 16 hwo many sixteenths would this be right here at your half way mark student 44 sixteenths 88 sixteenths now if i wanted my ruler marked off in fourths where are my fourths going to be
where is my one 4 going to be
one 4 well i have it marked off in eighths what is 2 8 simplify to many 14th 14th see 1234
one 42 fourths is going to be equal to a half this is where my 2 4 is going to be
see go another 412343 fourths 3 fourths then of course 4 4 over here at one whole right yeah give me a thumbs up if you re understanding this
okay i want you to take your whiteboard and i want you to find a partner and you will need a ruler
okay everyone should understand where your 4th mark is okay hands up maze 1st estimate the length of each maze
round are you getting an exact answer when you estimate estimating so you re going to estimate the length so you re going to estimate your length maze measure to the nearest 4th of an inch so you all should know where you re 4th of an inch is one your ruler right
yes if you do not know raise your hand and i ll help you find out where it is then you need to measure the actually length of each maze
you have to measure it like it s stretched out in one line you re going to measure it like this line right here do you see if maybe like this 1st one we re going to use this 1st one as an example do instead of going through each little line and following the whole maze
know student you can just you measure the 1st one and that s going to be the width of all of the lines right you can measure the length of this line but it s going to be the same as this one this one this one and this one do measure you re going to measure it and hten what can you do
student you re gonan multiply by how many 6 by 6 you have 123456 so you can take that measurement and multiply it by 6 right are you finished at that point
do student you have to right but what else are you going to have to measure student these down here there i don t think you ll be able to do that with number 2 and number 4 maybe not on number 2 and number 4 but you could do it with number 3 correct
yeah and then get the actual measurement of each maze partner you may work either at your desk or somewhere around the room with raise your hand if you do not have a ruler to take home with you
home i m going to be collecting these rulers back but if you don t that s in your school supply list so if you don t have a ruler to take home with you your homework is going to require you to use a ruler any of you not have a ruler like even back at your home class i don t have one like this okay if you need to i ll let you check one out to take home
so you need to come see me otherwise i m going to be collecting them before you leave
teacher do we have to measure to the nearest one 4
measuring to the nearest one 4
addition and subtraction of fractions with unlike denominators but before we start i d like you to put put your eyes on the focus wall please our focus wall morning today we will be able to add and subtract fractions with like and unlike denominators morning how are you going to prove to me that you know this
by getting a 75% or better on the quiz that i will give you at the end of the lesson our explanation tell me what you know boys and girls about the addition and subtraction of fractions with like and unlike denominators know what do i need to have in order to add fractions they have to have the same denominator they have to have the same denominator
no yes is that true for subtraction yes it absolutely is true for subtraction absolutely so if i give you this one half +2 eighths can i just add them together and get this
no 1st of all do we ever add our denominators don t can i put 2 denominators together that are different
cannot remember we talked about remember the example we talked about with the fruit and we talked about i ve got apples and i ve got oranges now if i said to you tell me how many apples i have can you count my oranges with my apples what apples and one is an apple and one is an orange
they re 2 different kinds of fruit now if i said how much fruit do i have altogether then can you count the 2 of them yes yes because they have the same denominator denominator or the same label boys and girls apples how many apples do i have
oranges 3 and how much fruit do i have good the word fruit is my common what label my common label or my common denominator yes we need to have a common denominator
practice 2 thirds and 18th i wanted to give you something that wasn t easy to pull out of your head this 1st of all when i look at this what s the 1st thing i have to do
is find a common factor not a common factor common denominator common denominator which is also known as a common label multiple or a common label boys and girls too many times i hear kids say i need a common factor a factor is a number that you multiply to get a product right
a multiple is a number that you land on when you skip count i want to know what number will i land on when i skip count by 3 and 8 now if you know it off the top of your head it s easy enough to say my answer is going to be 24 if you don t know it my suggestion write down your multiples of 3
24 and then i can look at my 2 lists and i can say 24 24 so i know my new number is 24 24 that s their common word their common label
24 multiply by 8 what you do to the bottom you must do to the top what do i do to my 8 to make it 24 multiply by 3 can you stop screaming out please get 1920 fourths i end up with 1920 fourths 1920 fourths are we okay with this
yes pop quiz no no pop quiz yet i know how to do a new lesson let s try it in subtraction gentlemen are you all set yes ma am okay one more outburst and we ll start counting down your points subtraction same concept as addition boys and girls
i ve got to find a common multiple denominator denominator multiple label p what is the common multiple between 8 and 2 16 i can use 16 but let s see if there s something smaller
8 let s go with the 8 so we don t have to reduce
point it would get us into negative numbers which we re not going to get into today
the answer to this would be -18th if you re thinking of it in terms of a number line this being 0 being broken down into eighths it would kind of be like negative i start at 3 eighths and i m going to take away so i m moving to the right how many spaces
44123 i start here 1234 my answer would be -18th but we re not going to get into negatives
better all right let s get some practice in on this and see how we do
okay would you pass one of these out to everybody and would you pass one of these out to everybody boys and girls the paper that you re getting there are 3 pages to it it is practice on addition and subtraction of fractions
they give us not just 2 fractions to add together but sometimes 3 or 4 does the rule change if i have 3 fractions versus 2 what multiple a common multiple exactly
make sure that wait a minute this 1st page needs to be double sided fine it s the last 2 that are double sided okay your pages 60 and 61 should be double sided
sense all right boys and girls make sure your name is on each of these papers
that they re the same yeah they are
myself can i have them please everybody pass them no keep them please boys and girls you should have you should have everybody should have page 60 and 61 correct yes everyone has 60 and 61
m anybody else that doesn t have 60 and 61 that s double sided okay all i m asking if you have 60 and 61 that s double sided then i don t know why these copied improperly okay then i ll take it back
girls can you pass that down please you are on the paper that is double sided 60 and 61 60 that s what you just passed back to me
mean teacher i know that and i realize that already what i m trying to get you to do is to focus on page 60 and 61 that is double sided okay all right we re starting with question number one question can you read that for me
chandra and tyler make 2 loaves of bread on monday they ate half of one loaf on tuesday they ate 13rd of one loaf how much bread was left over all right let s look at the information in this question boys and girls that is important to us
just like yesterday on the simulation you went through and underlined the information that helped you to write your paper right write your open response math information is given to us in the question which is going to help us answer the question what is important in that 1st sentence d 2 loaves there are 2 loaves of bread
so i ve got one and 2 size all right there s my 2 loaves of bread
m 1st sentence only nothing else really so when you go to answer your question who are you going to tell me
i have chandra and tyler them on monday they ate how much loaf do you think it s important to know that they did it on monday
okay is that about half okay on tuesday they ate 13rd of one loaf
here here s my question boys and girls how many of you at home when you have bread will open up a loaf of bread and let s say you were making sandwiches for lunch the next day
you use 6 slices of bread out of this loaf and you close it back up okay me most people don t you re going to finish up the 1st loaf right because you ve already opened it and if you leave it there it will go what
mold you don t open up a fresh loaf of bread every time you make a sandwich so my question is why did we take the 13rd from out of here
we maybe because cause that s how much excuse me i can t because why day so if i make my lunch on monday i m going to use one loaf of bread and then when i come to tuesday i m going to open a whole new loaf so it was after tuesday you need to stop screaming at me and you need to raise your hand
c because on monday they made the bread 1st not necessarily no maybe because this is a weird name chandra ate one loaf of bread on monday and then tyler ate a different bread on tuesday it doesn t necessarily say that boys and girls it just said on one day they ate half a loaf on the next day they ate a 3rd of a loaf
truth time do you know why you don t take the 3rd out of this loaf why because you re going but teacher we split it into halves and i can t take a 3rd out of a half right you re all going no no no no no i can t take a 3rd out of here i split this into even said you can t take a 3rd out of here cause it s a half
can all you have to do is go back and look at if i had divided this into thirds what would that have looked like so let s try solving it this way 1st and then we ll go back and solve it using one loaf of bread
m you could also if you didn t have take it from the half since a half is 50% and 13rd is 33.33% then i could do that
bigger can i take one half of a loaf and then 13rd of a loaf or as said can i eat 50% of my bread on monday and then 33.3% on tuesday yeah sure i can do that cause if i eat 50% on monday how much do i have left right so if i come the next day and i say i ve got 50% of my bread i m going to use 33.33% can i do that yeah sure i can do that
but most kids look at this and go i can t take a 3rd out of a half cause you split it into halves so let s solve it this way and then we ll go back and look at how to do it without having to cut into the 2nd piece of bread cause doing because doing it this way is going to cause you an extra step and you ll see where it comes in in 12nd so i ve eaten half of the bread and a 3rd
they want to know how much bread is left over so 50% is what as a fraction one half one half and what is 13rd as a fraction 13rd what is 13rd as a fraction 33.33 so i ve got a half and a 3rd
what common multiple a common multiple common denominator common label right things so tell me what number is a multiple of 2 and 366 what do i have to do to 2 to make it 6
multiply by 33 what do i have to do to 3 multiply by 2 what is 3 +5 or 3 +25 so how much bread did they eat 5 sixths they ve eaten 5 sixths but does that tell me how much is left over
question that tells me they ate 5 sixths but it doesn t tell me what they have left so with this answer would you have split these up differently
too so if i look at this i m going to say let s draw our bread again or let s just take away our division our separation you yell out one more time sir and you re going to do silent lunch for a week
control i know how much bread did she eat 5 sixths i want to cut this into what
there i m going to cut it into sixths and how many did she eat 6 so how much does she have left
one and 16th one whole loaf and how much of this 116th one and 16th that s how much bread is left easier and it makes it you need to put your clothes on appropriately sir again i ve already spoken to you about this 4 times this morning
again and i m going to send you down to teacher and let her deal with why you can t stay dressed all right boys and girls we end up with one and 16th left over easier to do when we take it from the same loaf yes much easier to do when we take it from the same loaf
please i m going to give you a couple minutes to put that on your paper fine take a moment please and put that on your paper
me teacher yes hi could you please send your attendance sure thank you
all right boys and girls i d like you to take a moment and try and do question number 2 on your own please
own you need to pick your pencil up sir and let s get started
them try question number 2 on your own please remember drawing the picture might be the last thing you want to do
so let s try doing the math 1st cause as we learned with the 1st one our picture might be different than what we think it s going to be
shh try and solve number 2 please try and solve number 2 please are we working on it
it 1st of all boys and girls you notice that they do not have the what denominator we need to find a common denominator so what is a multiple of both 8 and 488 so my 3 eighths is going to stay the same right
that what do i have to do to my 4 to make it an 8 honorable i m going to multiply it by 2 boys and girls don t change the rules that you already know it s not i m going to add these 24s together and make it an 8 no no no no no
we know when we are looking for common factor or common multiples that we need to do to our bottom number what we do to our top m +82 times one is
here now what do i need to do to this to make it an 8 times it by 44 times 4 not try again 22 boys and girls we know the rule about yelling out and yet some of us are still doing it j 88 over 8 right
now they have common denominators common multiples common labels i i was looking at the numerator i ve got my common multiple
i know that my denominator is going to be but one of them is going to have to go to a whole okay right now we re trying to get it into eighths and that s all we re focusing on
we re not focusing on anything else adding this into a whole is not necessarily what we want to do at this moment
boys and girls work on adding those 3 fractions together please please teacher we re videotaping for the harvard thing them okay
all right boys and girls so what s my total what s my total one whole and i ve got 8 and 2 and 3 which make 13 over 8 right and now what does it make a whole one and 5 eighths boys and girls did everybody come up with that
yes would you go grab a stack from teacher with those 2 things
it and i added i said 8 i said 8 out of 8 so i made it a 4 instead and then i added those 2 you made this a whole
now boys and girls i d like you to give your attention please
no no she was perfectly within her right to do it that way if that s what works for you great try it that way answer anybody that got something different or didn t understand what we just did
that so if it s an improper fraction you need to reduce fix it simplify it this is part of our simplifying okay all right i d like you to take a moment please look at number 3 and i know i ve already heard people go i can t do number 3
i don t understand it i would like you to in a restaurant voice to the person next to you discuss a strategy that you would use for number 3 in a restaurant voice which means i shouldn t be able to hear your conversation with your neighbor come up with a strategy for solving number 3 in a restaurant voice
i m going to give you 60 seconds i m going to give you 60 seconds boys and girls can you pass that to you need to be talking to your partner i don t want to talk right now to you
partner pass that to for homework i hear conversation that has nothing to do with my math problem 30 more seconds boys and girls
group i m going to come to each group and ask you to tell me how you re doing it cause some of you used that time to socialize do trying to figure it out okay so we put 2 into a fraction you turned 2 into a fraction and what did you make 2 as a fraction
okay so you had the idea to turn 2 into a fraction out figuring it out boxes boxes pencil that was her excuse me shh
do okay i need to know how you figured it out sir
me you were supposed boys and girls your 60 seconds was supposed to be used to come up with a strategy that you could explain how to solve this problem i would say probably 80% of you didn t listen to the instructions and the other 20% were busy discussing other things so far i ve had one group give me an idea
i did boxes i did 13rd and make another whole so put that into a so explain to me what you did with boxes
i made a box for thirds one box with thirds to make a whole okay so here are my 2 boxes right
away how many thirds am i going to take away 22 thirds right so if i shade out 2 thirds what am i left with you re left with a whole and 13rd a whole and 13rd i got that yeah that s what i got too that s what you got
okay boys and girls was there another way besides the boxes that worked yes apples and oranges okay how did you do that
2 whole okay i think you re on the right track and i think i understand what you re saying said we can revert back go back to our apples and oranges example
we ve got thirds so i know that i need to make this also what a fraction thirds right cause i want to make them not just apples and oranges but all the same fruit
so how many thirds are in 2 wholes 2 how many thirds are in 2 how many thirds are in one whole 33 so how many thirds are in 2 wholes 66 i don t know why i m getting 2 boys and girls hold on a minute i ve got kids telling me 2 thirds makes a whole
no it doesn t my question was how many thirds make a whole you told me 3 what if this number was fourths how many fourths make a whole 44 so how many fourths would make 2 wholes 88 what if this number was 16th how many sixths make a whole 66 so how many 6s would make 2 wholes 12 12 you tracking with me on this boys and girls
yes so i m going to convert this into thirds how many thirds make 2 wholes 66 thirds if i gave you this can you do that 24 but that is a what
what simplify it to one and multiple students 13rd that s all it is boys and girls denominator that is rule number one for adding and subtracting fractions fractions can you do that in percent we ll talk about percentages later
answer okay you have 2 minutes talk to your partner about a strategy
are we talking no we don t to do that amazing again the one time we have permission to talk and we re not
i told her remember you re looking for a strategy boys and girls
answer i want to know how you got your answer we re on to something you re on to something okay
t so since he has since he did that 30 seconds boys and girls can we have one more minute sure i ll give you 60 more seconds
i have my strategy i have my strategy thank you for waiting quietly it are we working back there sir it i see a lot of pencil playing
10 more seconds boys and girls with a show of hands please thumbs up if you got a strategy and you think it worked
okay thumbs to the side if you think you were on something but you didn t quite get the answer you were almost there and thumbs down if you were totally lost and had no idea where to begin it all right let s see some of those thumbs up people and hear what your strategy was
you fraction like fourths and 14th okay let s pretend like teacher knows no math whatsoever
i m new to the country and i want you to explain to me where do i start question i took and then i put i put my plate and then i put the circles around okay so hold on
have 6 okay i took margaret she ate one whole and one and then a brownie and a half so can i do margaret ate this whole and margaret ate half of this one
okay what did you do next ma am and then i did charlie he ate 2 wholes and 33 fourths charlie ate how much 14th 14th so can i come down here and do charlie is that okay
yes but tyler only hold on 2 and 14th okay now tell me tyler then tyler had one whole but he can t have his 3 fourths why not he can excuse me do not get out of your seat sir look at what i have
i ve got this brownie that s cut into fourths and charlie s eaten 14th i ve got this brownie cut into a half and that half is left so can he get his 3 fourths yes yeah sure i can take them out of this brownie so the question is how much brownies are left on the plate
look half there s a half yes i was right make sure you label your answer i was right and this should just say a half of a brownie is left okay boys and girls does her strategy work
absolutely remember what i told you sit down please remember what i told you about the pictures up it s easy to get confused if we draw don t draw our shapes exactly right
great now is there someone in the class that used just math numbers no pictures just math numbers to get your answer m i added up all the numbers okay all right let s do this
so i ve got one.52 and 14th and one and 3 fourths now what do you mean when you say i added up all the numbers what the whole numbers you added up all the whole numbers
okay so one and 2 and one make 4 make 4 okay so i can cross those out cause i ve dealt with those next i put i did 13rd +14th +3 fourths and got a whole 14th +3 fourths makes a whole
can and what do i have left left so this is how much was eaten right
left 6 brownies 5.56 -5 is one did i have one.5 left
no 6 -5 is one right but one minus the half leaves me with one half one half did the boxes work yeah did the math verify that the boxes worked
did if you were to give me these 2 answers on a test you d get a 4 perfect what label nice we have to label half a brownie is left yes yelling i did it in a different way how did you do it
and when i did margaret you had 3 fourths of a brownie left over
wrong okay if you drew your brownies right so these are the 6 brownies there charles got 2 whole brownies yes and 14th of another one okay
tyler got one whole brownie and 3 fourths of another one it works out that charlie and tyler were eating off part of the same brownie right cause we cut that brownie into fourths now if you look up here all these brownie pieces have been accounted for except for that half a brownie so what s left over
one half nice job boys and girls i d like you to go on and try question number 5 this time i would like you not to talk to your partner and i d like you to try it on your own
boys and girls with a show of hands how many of you can see why now it s so important to know your multiplication facts i always know them i haven t finished i m done without knowing those multiplication facts we ve got to go back and do a whole lot of writing out which takes us so much more time than it needs to
when you know your facts you can look at those denominators and know instantly what that common multiple is
all right let s see somebody that has not talked 3 fourths and 9 sixths tell me what they had for a common multiple into when you skip jump by 4 and you skip jump by 6 what is a number that they both go into 12
12 okay so i m going to make my fractions twelfths and what do i do to 4 to make it a 12 shh i know you know sir 12 what 24 times 2 is 12
no times 3 i m going to multiply it by 34 times 3 is 12 top 3 times 3 is what did i do to my 6 to make it a 12
2 now can i add them yeah can i add these 2 fractions because they have the same denominator right 27 boys and girls i don t call on you because i know you already know it i am trying to work with to make sure she knows it
so when you scream answers out you re just being rude and taking her opportunity to learn 27 tell me again 27 now when you look at that fraction what do you notice
i and improper fraction it is an improper fraction because my top number is bigger than my bottom 27 yeah can i take more than one set of 12 from 27
left what s 12 and 12 make what i have 3 twelfths can i reduce 3 twelfths is there a number that will go into both 3 and 12 this is where knowing your multiplication facts come in really handy
s 3 is a prime number so there s only 2 numbers that make up 331 times what gives me 3 12 how many times
so my reduction would be so my whole answer would be 2 and 14th did everybody get this boys and girls this no yeah that s what i was excuse me if you have a problem you need to raise your hand
p tell me again you had trouble with the 27 what was you had problems simplifying it
okay again boys and girls multiplication facts i cannot stress this enough you re trying to learn a new concept and if you have to keep going back in your head focusing on 0 wait a minute how many 12s are in 27 and how many times is that it s only going to bog you down
now a good 98% of you passed my multiplication tests unnecessary if you ve passed them they should be in here it s retrieving it boys and girls and for those of you who are still for working to pass it we need to pick up our pace a little bit because you are going to forever be dealing with multiplication facts
all math is based on addition subtraction multiplication and division those 4 operations all math is based on addition subtraction multiplication and division you can do that with fractions decimals whole numbers all different kinds of different things variables but your 4 operations addition subtraction multiplication division they are not going away
multiplication boys and girls was not something sir could you put that chair over on the wall and you can stand now multiplication is not just something you learn in 4th grade to pass over and never use again it is the foundation boys and girls of all the math you re going to learn just like addition and subtraction multiplication division foundational without them you re going to struggle to get through these new ideas
me try number 6 on your own please
6 are we doing number 6 sir
can you put your shirt back on correctly please and get your pencil out and answer number 6 please you still do not have your clothes back on correctly sir
you i m going to give you about 30 more seconds boys and girls
12 12 good job so i know my new fraction or my new denominator is going to be 12 k multiply by 3 by 3 so what am i going to multiply that by by 3 by 3 what do i do to 3 to make it 12
multiply by 4 and what s 4 times 14 so what s 12 twelfths +4 twelfths 16 twelfths now what do you notice about that fraction improper it s improper nice job how many sets of 12 can i take out of there
over 444 what what 13rd there we go problem i was going to tell you okay we solved it as an addition problem
now let s solve it as a subtraction problem okay let s try it again quiet 12 over 12 twelfths -4 twelfths gives me 8 twelfths gives me 8 twelfths and what do we notice about this fraction
form i can t reduce this any more d reduce it to 2 thirds
2 just kidding all right let s go friends we have a lot to do today yeah i know let s we ve been reviewing powers of 1010 when we review the powers of 10 we re talking about remember that we must 1st know the basic facts 1st why is it important for us to know the basic facts 1st when we re talking about powers of 10
so what can help you you how does knowing the basic facts help you with the powers of 10 how does knowing the basic facts help you with the power of 10 okay right we add the zeroes
this it says use the basic facts and patterns to find the product one what is the basic fact in 9 times 87272 all right 72 we write the basic fact 1st and then how many zeroes do we see 33 so it s 123123 what answer did you get
144000 excellent all right here we have 3000 times 40 okay what is the basic fact that we must do 1st 3 times what 4 what does 3 times 4 equal 1212 now we count the what zeroes 12341234
i don t know what s up with that i m sorry here we go we re moving on and right now i want you to make sure that you re on your best behavior today as every day
here 12 times 512 times 5 and what does 12 times 5 equal 60 never mind never mind never mind 60 okay now does this count in our zeroes yeah no no we have to go 12341234 okay what is the basic fact here
7 times 37 times 3 good and what is the answer 2121 okay and how many zeroes do i have 1234512345 now i ll put my comma right there and right there what right here is the basic fact
what 3636 and i add the what 2 zeroes 2 zeroes excellent yay job thank you to those who are paying attention quietly and who were listening all right products again this is still multiplying by 10 but what i wanted us to do with these is i wanted us to do them using our strategies
okay so i just wanted you to write these numbers down for me real quick because i m about to go to another page no i just want you to write down 93 times 60 skip the space 25 times 30 say 93 times what
60 okay 93 times 60 2089 times 87 okay what was that
20 okay and what else 87 times 10 okay i wanted to put this on this sheet so i could just show you something
because this is a number at the top right here similar to the 10s place ones and 10s this is ones and 10s right here we can do the 3 strategies strategies the 1st strategy is the old fashioned way that my 4th grade teacher made me do correct yes and the 2nd strategy we learned was the box strategy and that way it breaks it down into 4 boxes or 6 boxes to help us
then we also learned the last strategy which happens to be okay but in this strategy i want to show you something because if you notice in the right hand corner in the ones place on all of these numbers you see the same number
my 1st line is going to be a what a 0 that what is the basic fact times 00 so i know that no matter if i go here or here it s going to be 0 so if this is strategy using this one when i see a 0 right here do you think it s going to be helpful for me to use the box no do you think it s going to be helpful for me to use no
in this case it would probably make the most sense to choose strategy number one what once i see this is 0 i give it a hug and a kiss and i move on so what is 6 times 31818 carry my one what is 6 times 954 +one
there because there is a 0 there i don t have to add anything cause anything +0 is this answer right here that s identity property yes identity property is one property of 0 that s 0 property i like how you remember your properties though that s very good
one the property of 0 is anything times 0 is 00 is 0 so look at here don t you have to 0 times 0 well that s what i m saying what i was trying to tell you is if you see a 0 right here you re right i could put a 0 here and then i could do like this and i could have a 00
right but i know that because i see a 0 here it s automatically if it helps you to put the 2 zeroes then please do here i know that 0 times 5 is what i yeah so i hug and kiss it goodbye so 3 times 5 is what 15153 times 26
6 okay +one 750 thank you all right now i want you to try and do for this one and i want you to try to do this one on your own in your notebook wait is that 87 or that s an 87
87 times so you have to use the strategy i just showed you
what hug and kiss goodbye 2 times 9 is 14 times 2 is 8 +one is 9 yeah the right answer is 9 can i do the next one all right you can write this next one just in a minute 87 times 10
okay 7 times 0 is 008 times 0 is 00 hug kiss one times the number is what 0 yeah all right here we go
i want you to do something we ve got one more page we were talking about yesterday
number if it was this it would be rounded to the 10s place here it would be round to the what 10100s place here 10s 10s 100s 10s 100s 10s 100s okay so let s look at this one real quick it sounds round each factor and then estimate the product okay what we re going to do is we re going to do this together to show you kind of what we did yesterday
so if we took 35 and we rounded up what number is that going to be 40 okay i don t know what is up with that board okay if we take 189 and i do front end estimation what number is this going to be 20200 what is 200 times 40
4 what s 2 times 48123123 it s the same
i ll wait pens down listen some people learn by not having you guys talk and talk and talk and talk notes you need to be quiet so that other people can understand here we rounded it up or down
why because over 5 give it a push less than 5 give it a rest give it a rest okay so let s look at this next 174 and 26
to 30 what is up with that okay that s a 3 all right so what is 7 times 3 it 2000 all right so i did example number one
no in your notebook right now i want you to try to do 3 and 4 the same way that i just showed you yes that s what you re supposed to do 0 that is to the nearest one
we were supposed to round each factor and then figure out the product that s what our review is from yesterday i m just using these numbers possibly go ahead and freeze on that computer for a 2nd i need to make sure i ve got a
162 times 235 to 6060 okay can you you froze me back thank you
all right so we said 60 right teacher okay to 20200 okay what is the basic fact here
what is the basic fact 2 times 6 and what does that equal 12 and then what do we have yeah but this one s 10
100s but i said front end estimation that front end estimation we would round to the what together all right you have that one wrong you help me do this one so we understand to 88 is that closer to 80 or is that closer to 90
90 okay very good all right now remember we re doing front end estimation so we re rounding the 100s door that 4 is that above or below 5 below so do we go back to 300 or do we go up to 400 here 9 times 3 what does 9 times 3 equal
2727 excellent all right that add the 3 zeroes add the 3 zeroes 123 very good okay so that is what we did yesterday yesterday today we re about to go into our guided math groups but before we do i want to go back and make sure you understand the 3 strategies
what were the 3 strategies that i taught you how to solve multiple digits times double digit multiplication facts one lattice lattice give me another 11 old fashioned old fashioned like old fashioned ms
okay so here we have i m going to give you actually i m going to make it a little harder so i want you to try to do it now what i want to tell you is that we re going to do this one you may choose your strategy before you go to guided math you may only use those there strategies you have 221 times 48
problems i m going to give you 3 or 4 minutes you need to solve these problems using one of the 3 strategies i taught you before we go to guided math groups are you going to copy yes i ll do that yes are you allowed to do you have to do 2 different ones not this time normally yes i make you do both strategies but this time i m just going to say you pick your favorite and do it
but if you think that your answer is not right what should you do way some people can get it right using the box each time
remember when you make the box remember how i told you how many you have to make the box it has to be a what rectangle and then remember what i said was easiest for me helps me do it is do what
1st that helps me remember and i always do what corner that corner because then i just have to do corner to corner to corner to corner corner corner corner corner okay otherwise always do those 2 corners 1st
easier do the box
lattice is easiest for you lucky yeah we ve got a teacher that lets us do different strategies yes my teacher said you may only do it the old fashioned way i bet she always said huh huh she would say huh huh all right let s get started here we go
right here we go one you want to come up and do your strategy i want to i m sorry friends but if you call out i do not call on you rule and he did it the old fashioned way so you can come up and try to do it real quick you want me to help you do it
no are you nervous i couldn t reach up there sh
we re not talking to anybody need to concentrate you have to push hard on the board
right keep going 8 times one
0 +2 okay and what do i need to do with that 8 hug and kiss there you go very good hm hm 0 lord
i did it the old you have the same answer you just have to finish doing finish it up go all right so what strategy did he use old fashioned right now somebody who used the lattice strategy you know what here this is something you ve been struggling with and i want to see you do it
on well i ll help you out here hold on
0 awesome quiet quiet that is so cool hush those who are listening and not talking here you go
on sorry here you go we ll just forget that that s there all right look there they have their lattice set up this way
yes huh huh huh enough all right let s check it right 488 good she s been struggling with this multiplication problem but she s doing really well i know it s hard
head you know what i always do 10 then add the 6 cause it makes it easier so there again that s my little so write the whole answer down here so we can see it
all right so the whole answer then write it right here so they can see the whole answer put your commas in
10608 is that correct yes that s awesome all right so we see that some people might enjoy this strategy if they re successful at that so remember what i said no matter what whatever class you re in you can say you re allowed to do that strategy okay yeah some people like this strategy so you should use this one
box all the ways are correct as long as you come up with the right answer all right here we go let s talk about what our group learned today and we can finish up quiet this is your last chance before you get your card marked
i mean your agenda marked all right so here we have our groups today i m going to group a which is and here i m going to talk to in just a 2nd and then group c you will group b you will start
computers group b you re going to be with teacher and group c you re going to start off at seat work and i m going to explain what seat work is
remember if you re on computers you re going to multiplication com practicing our basic math facts why do we need to know our basic math facts it will be easier to multiply and divide divide all right for your seat work today we re going back and one of the skills that we didn t do well on was what
line graphs line graphs remember that we did awful at that that s why we re going back and reviewing it okay you re going to do this sheet and use the graph to help you answer the questions when you finish that you re going to open up your math book
me open up your math book to page 1056 let s do it without talking so that we can get to our groups so i can teach 3 groups today 105 notice that it says maintain and review what are we maintaining graphs graphs
you so you re going to do seat work work worksheet and page what 105 105 i m waiting for you to listen so i know you understand how i know you re listening is that you re on your bottom and you re looking at me
room that way i know that when i m in my group you re not going to come over there and say what are we doing again so everybody s book is open to page 105 105 on the back of your seat work sheet right here sheet from the board today i m going to keep it right here okay you can log on your computer
group do we do the even ones or all of them you re doing all of them because there s only 8 +7 is 15 questions yes the last time we did the groups we didn t get to go to computers all right so then we ll start off today i ll see group a
group b you didn t get to go to computers last time yeah okay so then i ll start off with group c today computers and group c meet me at the back table
you need to bring your journals every time you come to me
remember and i said she had to buy 8 postcards that cost $5.25 $5.20 and we had to figure out what was the highest price she could get okay well today we re going to be talking about problem solving and making lists and how do we figure out the easiest way to you know what
160 i apologize page 160
i m sorry why do you think that we should learn how to make and organize lists to help us decide something why do you think we should learn that organizing lists is like if you want to know how much peaches for example since it s like it says if you take 1000 peaches to a factory you got to figure out how many peaches you d have to pick a whole entire day
huh and so when you figure that out your bucket you d have like one bucket if you didn t use that 100 peaches so if you would have 20 buckets you have 2000 buckets of peaches can somebody tell me what does the expression between 30 and 35 mean
what is between 30 and 35 what if your mom said we re going to do between 10 and 15 minutes of something does she ever say that my dad or it s going to take anywhere between 10 and 15 minutes to do this project what do you think that means if you say you re going to play for like an hour to 3 hours that means you can come back at any time from like an hour and 3 hours right
like my mom she used to always say okay we re going to be at the store for only you know between 20 and 40 minutes i mean we can be at the store 21 minutes and we can be at the store for what for 35 minutes for 35 minutes she s kind of giving you a range
remember how we talked about that giving you a range of something how is a list organized how is a list organized like if i have a list and here is my list laundry number 2 dishes
list okay yes you can do a shopping list no you can just right let s look at this number 5
jeremy has 278 peaches to deliver to 8 small produce stands each stand must receive between 30 to 35 okay so if each stand receives the same number of peaches what is the greatest number of peaches jeremy can deliver to each stand
total 276276 peaches okay and how many stands does he have to go to to 88 so we ve got to figure out what do we multiply to get as close to that as we can so he can deliver how many peaches 35 okay so let s try
80 times 30 is what what is 80 times 302400 okay okay you look right here
it says see how you can use this strategy to find the answer he s made a list right let s go back and we ll do 31 but 31 times 8 only equals what to 278276 so it looks like he can t go over 35 peaches can he
no so it says 34 peaches times 8 is what 272 that s very close 63280 exactly what is that
v 270 something look right there how much can he deliver 200 and what 200 and how much can he deliver 200 and what 210 than greater than so we need to find a number that is less than 276
so which one of these which one of these numbers would be less than 27634 times 834 times 8 so how many peaches did he deliver to all 8 stands that was the total number of peaches
how many peaches could jeremy take to the stands he could distribute out like that he said jeremy had to go to 8 stands okay so he went to 8 stands he could only deliver between 30 and 35
deliver which one of these products is close to 276 but not over okay
27234 times 8 excellent so how many peaches did he deliver to all 8 stands that s what he delivered to all 8 stands how many peaches did he deliver to each stand 3434 excellent excellent job okay so let s look at the next page
number one we re still talking about jeremy and really jeremy you re going to come time when the same person s name is in the book okay okay so it s not that big of a deal he s just in our math book
2 it says what if jeremy had 302 peaches and wanted to deliver between 35 and 40 peaches to each of his 8 stands what is the greatest number of peaches he could deliver to each stand so that they receive the same amount what make our what
what 35 times 8 okay so 35 times 8 what does that equal 280 all right going yeah is 208 greater than or less than 302
do 3636 times 8 okay what is 6 times 8484 what is 24 times 424 excuse me +428 okay is that greater than or less than
we okay let s try one more 37 times 8 what s 8 times 756 so i put my 6 here and i carry my what 55 what is 8 times 32424 +5 ooh that is very close 296 so do you think like 297 298 299 300 301302
we re just 6 away but how many produce stands do we have 88 so i m just thinking do you think i m going to be able to multiply again no you want to try and see all right we ll try 38 times 8 what is 8 times 864 don t hide it s good to check your what is 8 times 3
2424 +6 it it was over it was just 2 over but 6 what +6 is going to get 822 so how many over was i
what is the most ryan will pay per pound for £3 of peaches at miller s produce stand right class i ve got all of the pencils ready yeah okay we have to make our what list we have to make a list so we can t go over what $2.45 that s our goal total right he gave us a range between what
7979 and ¢82 okay and how many pounds are we £3 £3 right so what am i going to multiply all of these numbers by 3 to start with 79 the 79 times 3 is 9 times 3 is 27
carry my 2 82 make it crazy yeah so make it crazy 82 times 3
6 what is 8 times 324 that was close it was close we were what over so what should we go down 8181 right 81 would be the closest
see for $2.45 that no what 381 times 3 okay so 81 times 3 is 8 time 3 is 3 how do you know it s a girl 8 times so what is it
graph we ve also guessed and checked it s kind of hard and then we ve also looked at patterns we have which we re working on next week and then i gave you that yeah
before yes all right so we ve learned about the strategies we did an organized list and worked backwards is our last list we re going to use for problem solving yes we re going to talk about how to work backwards this is serious yes it is
right so what we re going to do right now we have to review the last 5 minutes but before we review close the laptops down make sure that your desk is cleared off because we must complete our math facts test yay
thank you to those friends who are sitting down quietly and they re getting ready to go
back who is making that noise time what happened here thank you for those who are sitting down quietly
bottom i had a meeting the rest of these printed out they re coming here we go
please put your name on the paper
have remember our graph right here day we need more people be we need to get above the line we need to get our our class goal is to get everybody what line above the line i m going to do it
and does everyone have a test yeah
ready yes
region and what are the differences and similarities between area and perimeter g well i have a thing to write the differen i mean i m going to say the way they re different the way they re the same is because they both have to have square units units
okay and and the way their different is area is talking about how many square units are in the figure and perimeter is talking about how many . how many go ahead how do you want to say it that s the tricky part huh
okay okay how many like parts that are not getting covered by other square units like the line part outside right it s kinda hard to explain it with that isn t it but that was good
i got something the perimeter is the total distance between around it
yes and the area is the how many units contained inside what d you want to add for area or perimeter either area is length times width and perimeter is like width around the figure or whatever right so you re going to have to count all sides involved so when you re working on the review here you want to add something usually the area is different from the perimeter 0 yeah area is going to be different from the perimeter
different it goes back to what was saying he s going to the area is only counting the the perimeter is the things on the outside but the area counts up all the area on the inside right exactly
i m going to draw an odd shape here let s say this is 3 this is one 2 one equals 5 3 how come there s one on the side one on the top and one on the bottom and one of the 2 i mean 3
n the perimeter is width like count the sides length but when you want like basically i didn t draw very proportionate did i it s hard like the area is the how many are inside like how many blocks there is how many squares there is right the square units so you want to count all the blocks on the inside of it
in this case what is our area of that 11 yeah so we just count all these right yeah which is
n 11 square units 11 square units now well can t spell units what is the perimeter of that one you forgot down here
okay so that would add a little more because you forgot the 5 right so we got 3 and 3 is 6 +2 is 8 10 16 thank you and these square units and this is mental block
28 28 the perimeter is 28 okay i m going to give you a few minutes to finish up the review n is there square so you write square units yes you can put sq
b i think i know what he s trying to say i think he s trying to say it s kind of like that one thing where we took a number and then we put down and then when you said was the difference between hold on to it that one where were trying to like multiply them and then you have that 0 like squared and cubed with how with the 2 like in the corner of it is different than how when we re trying to
this is what i m talking about this right here exponent that means squared which is what these are square units it that means that is the power of 2 is the number times itself so that s what squared is
so which is you don t you have to know it as far as area goes units how come like when we were in a younger grade the smaller grades they ll teach us the stuff but when we get in higher grades they teach us again because you re going to do it another level up the aks covers further up and harder levels at your grades
just like i did data no algebra with you guys at the same time as i was teaching algebra with the 5th graders but the 5th graders had a lot more aks that we had to make sure they understood and that s why some of the things i extended down to yours because it s good to challenge you guys to do some of those harder things that you re going to have to do next year and then some 0 so it s like we do something but it s easy and then when it gets harder we move up
right right cause like the 2nd graders i teach for eip in the morning they re doing times attacks and multiplication but they don t understand the whole process of multiplying like 2 and 3 digits and things like that so what s eip that s where i help kids who have trouble in math and reading so they come and help at team time in the morning upstairs well their team time i come and i help them it s like tutoring
0 told me that some of her friends go t do you have to know compound figures for the accelerated tests i don t know i m not going to answer questions like that what s a compound figure it s the aks for 5th grade that s what you have to know
if you want to look you can go to the county website and take a look at what the 5th grade has on it so area alright so for the 1st one let s just go around the room and check our answers cause i m going to go with it because i haven t answered these
one 11 square units everybody agree with that yes we re going to go across or down okay i got 11 square units another 11 square units okay 13 do we have to write square units from the example no cause it doesn t show it in the example so
13 okay number 5 13 number 6 back what s the confusion number 5
13 this is 11 this is 11 this is 13 this is 13 and this is 10 16 10 the bottom one that she said was 13 is 10 you said across yeah we re going across yeah we re going one 2 3 4
11 11 13 13 10 16 11 12 like the go in like this they do this that s not number 5 you said number 6 number 6 was 13 13 13 13 next one 10 16 10 16 and then
11 no it s 12 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 okay 12 what do we got down here 15 and 17 agreement 21 12 21 12 thank you side nu huh no calling out hang on we ll do it together if we re going to do it together we ll say it together
perimeter 131st one 14 we got a difference here 3 and 3 is 6 +4 is 10 12 13 +one more is 14 got 16 everybody agree yes okay we got 16 on this one
one 2 3 4 what i did i counted . 16 i counted the 2 boxes like right here 2 4 i did that 4 +4 equals 8 plus another 4 equals 12
160 yeah me how we doing m
j is this how we get the same area as perimeter like a square no that s for area 0 that is 16
one is there a way you would have squares inside the squares i mean yeah you can do length times with you can alright let s move on just because there s different numbers involved here 16 16 okay box 5
22 22 box 6 18 7 18 all in agreement 22 wait which one are we on
right here 22 these numbers are constantly repeating alright what do we got for this one 20 22 what d you get get 2nd from the bottom left side
j 20 20 alright so we re going with 20 i ll check here 28 28 what we got here 22 22 last one
on we are going to carry this off about perimeter i m giving you an exemplar done this 0 you were just complaining
crackers yay table i can t eat animal crackers they get stuck in my teeth you don t have to eat them you just have to figure out something just a 2nd i don t like animal crackers we re waiting
for what you thank you you missed 3 i ll finish them alright put your warm up to the side let s take a look at the exemplar put this to the side we got to hurry up teacher we only got 10 more days of school left read the directions
each of you has been given a bag of bear ums and animal crackers you haven t gotten those so go with reading 1st each of you has been given a bag of bear animal crackers your 1st task is to create a frequency table to record the different animals and count them to get a total number of animal crackers do not count broken or fractional pieces so we left a space right there for you to create your frequency table
then you re going to move on down and look at the diagram below to show how fence sections are connected again going up here to thinking about perimeter and area then you have to determine whether your bag of animal crackers will need an even number or odd number of pieces of fencing out you count and you re going to design cages that you can put one animal in each of the cages
and you re going to tell me the least amount of money possible to create that fencing for example on the one here you re going to get 2 animals in that right so you re creating this fence and here you can have one animal 2 animals now if you had more if you had 3 obviously you re going to have more than that
$2.50 now if you kept going in a line will that be less expensive or should you start to come and build some of them down here and change it saying i would do that with my fencing i don t know
it s because you don t have that much fences if you go here then you have these to do and sometimes in my head and if we go down here are we going to have less fencing let s say that s 7 8 but each but it says each fence can only hold one animal right so you re going to create a frequency table
which is the different kinds of animal crackers you have and how many of each one then you re going to think about if you re going to create fencing and cages for each animal so if you have 20 animals in your bag you re going to have to create fencing for 20 cages
$2.50 you mean both this and this and this and all those each piece of fencing is $2 that one piece is $2.50 this one piece is $2.500 so the more you share fences you might save money you see what i m saying but we have no well that s what my question asks you though
s instead of using can we do that you can go in a line if you want or you can go like this if you want you can do either way do the animal crackers have to fit in the boxes no that s a visual boxes instead of a frequency table can we do a bar graph no i want you to do a frequency table
because the last part i was going to have you do it for the whole group and do a line plot and we may not get finished today alright teacher what s a frequency table 0 we forgot the frequency table okay we haven t done it in so long you have to sort your animals so one is going to be the animals
animals so if you go ahead and let me go ahead and pass out the bags and then we ll go over that then we re going to do a line plot line plot is number 3 what is this that s what we need to discuss you can talk with the people at your table about which animal is which i don t even know what one of these animals are
are we going to eat them after we re done not till we re done graphing can we have a partner and just use one bag each who didn t get a bag table i couldn t create it because i don t know how many different animal shapes there are
we re sorting these by the different animals and counting how many of each animals but they re not real animals why do they need cages well because that s the exemplar one i have a question where do we put the gates so the 1st thing you need to do is create the frequency table in that box you have to sort out all your animals and figure out how many different animals you have
i already figured out how many animals because we did an exemplar once on this so i see there s there s 5 different animals soon as you find out the different animals let me know yes does this have a fraction these are all fractional pieces so what are some of the animals you re discovering
n is this considered a broken a fractional no that s big what about this you re allergic you can t touch you don t have to eat them i can t touch them you can t touch them then i ll just give you some data and write it down for you okay
chart look how many llamas i have shh sometimes if they re around it too long then alright stop do we count the fractional piece no
is let me go ahead and sort this bag and then i ll give you that data you can start the chart okay i have a good idea she s not allergic to skittles so why don t we give her . no we re not sorry does this count as a fractional piece no no no
can we eat the fractional ones yes you may eat the fractions this one is what do you call that a cow cows nope these are what is this
that s an elephant 0 elephant alright is this a tiger shapes teacher hold on i ll give you a treat anyway after you okay
you you can sit over here by the little computer you can have a piece of candy if you want teacher you know how you said the tiger there s a joke with the tiger that s why i eat them you see how it adds up to like a
g i think i have it sorted so this is what i got one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 i got 8 animals so that s the different kinds the different ones we got an elephant so you can make your table
camel what do you call those buffalo buffalo okay buffalo we got 3
how do you know what they look like what s this that s a rhino a rhino this is a rhino these are different no stop that s mine
these are different these don t go with those and these don t go with these could you do your own please there yes that s what a frequency table is teacher it s a cow
2 teacher i have a camel wait there s a cow
are i think that s a unicorn horse zebra donkey there isn t a unicorn a polar bear and a tiger
a tiger yeah that s it cat a lion you got a lion what s this teacher zebra yeah that s how i ate one of them
well i guess this that s a rhinoceros that s a rhino i have 4 different types then write them all down what s this a rhino you forgot one
teacher what do you think this is hold on a 2nd rhino looks like a rhino to me there s no way it s a turtle this is not a turtle what s not a turtle it s not a turtle is it a hippo it s sideways its rhinoceros or a hippo we put this one as a hippo and we put that shh
what is this i don t know i can t tell buffalo i want to know what this is teacher said it s a buffalo bear we re going to make that a bear how we doing we got them all sorted at least somewhere or another in a column something
i m just going to sort them and then say they that work for you you okay so now what you have to do is figure out
many i have 8 animals and i need 21 cages how do you have you said 21 animals yes now cages now calculate the best way to build the fencing teacher i didn t say to draw the fencing i said calculate it or you can draw it on the back on an extra piece of paper
can i just call this a cat yeah if you want to call it as a cat call it as a cat it on an extra piece of paper you can draw it huh yes
alright after you ve sorted them to some sort and called them the animals you think they look like then you probably need an extra piece of paper or graph paper to help you draw the fencing
that s probably your best bet to try to figure out so you re total number is how many cages you re going to have to make but then you re going to have to count how many fence sections you will need
teacher i found one that looks like a dinosaur is there a rhino i thought there was a rhino i didn t have one but you might of rhino but that i dunno this is a dinosaur that is either a rhino or a hippopotamus what
cow no you can call it whatever you think it looks like fencing thanks huh this is sure as long as you got enough for your each animal one cage per animal this is a zebra that s a donkey then what is this zebra has the little stripes
no that s a cat huh i would say that s a zebra because of the stripy thing or a horse
i think that s supposed to look like this because they don t all look the same because they are animal crackers and when they go in the oven to cook they don t all look exactly the same
sounds good and then i calculated that i need 42 pieces of fencing times $2.50 teacher this isn t a zebra this is an antelope well if that s what you want to call it then that s what you want to call it
so see i have 44 she s going to need she s going to need 45 pieces of fencing if she did it the way i did it yes what if you did 4 by 4 would that change the fencing no how do you know cause i already tried that i already tied that 4 right here do it like this
actually yes it would or actually no it wouldn t what is this cause you need to continue on
what i did for the ones that i put that i already had i put a line through them so i wouldn t do them again 40 this only uses 40 you ahhh check it out i mean it
that s okay they won t make a difference it will still be the number of fence pieces can i get some water did you say a line at the very end you re not there yet fencing wait till someone s almost done so that when i m done he s going to i had $202.50
it read the directions $105 how many did you have 15 that wouldn t make the most of the shape because that would not be more efficient 4 by 4 would be more efficient how many fence posts do you have
21 and then i made my connectors and then i got teacher would you tell to 45 go check that teacher can we do this but they can connect see how i drew this
animals so that means we can take this part away and if there are 2 elephants the elephants can live together no no we re not changing that up one per cage one per cage but what if it s a big cage no $2.50 is that the most efficient way
way why because had 16 and he did only 2 rows that 4 by 4 is more efficient because . but we found that 4 by 4 we only used 40 fence posts when he did it in 2 rows of 8 he used how many pieces 42 42 so his would of cost more that way
so which one should i do his way no he has a different number then what am i going to do i m just saying that you should try one other way because we re trying to figure out what s the most efficient cost wise 0 gotcha on more pages just try to figure it out as you re calculating
the most efficient is 4 because if you do 5 by 5 5 doesn t go into 16 so you shouldn t do that 7 i have not seen that one
cow you want to call it a squirrel you can call it a squirrel what you need babe i used a 3 by 7 okay a 3 by 7 goes downward so it s a pretty good one my estimation i was going to use 84 pieces for $209 but my estimation cut back when it was 52 pieces and $130
l alright before we finish up for a minute and clean up we re not going to be able to get to the number 3 where you actually table it all but if your information is recorded we can continue this on monday without your animal crackers and you may take your crackers with you but you need to get your recording done if you want to save your crackers and save them and leave them here i ll put a tub out and you can use a marker and write your name
what do i do after this okay so you need to get her information and do a line plot with you and s whole information
i m done with them since you were playing with them you might as well just through them away okay yeah so staple these and then i ll collect them this is where we leave them right okay so this is what we re going to do today thank you for listening
am i know that s why i complemented you i was trying to get s attention what i would like you to do is staple your 2 pieces together don t take them home because we need to get our paperwork to go home staple them and i ll keep them for monday and we ll continue
so you come and put them in the tub get your papers and your letter that need to go home and then we ll finish up and finish talking about this monday teacher are we keeping this you may have your animal crackers and your pencil is yours
all right so you ll be back about a quarter of go today we re going to start talking about fractions fast and i got real fancy last night
i decided to make a powerpoint except on my computer at home it goes much slower than on this one so let s see there today we re going to talk about fractions tell me what you know about fractions
you what do you know about a fraction i can t see slide over honey what do you know about fractions they make a number they split the number up what do you mean they split a number up they . take out of . they kind of like divide it into 2 s okay so fractions can show division
and you said pieces well not really pieces but . denominator there s a numerator and a denominator do you re throwing out some good math terms what s a numerator
a numerator is . how much . how much pieces are in like a whole okay so the numerator refers to the number of pieces of something okay what does the denominator tell us
okay can you tell me more about the whole number when you re talking in terms of the denominator what else can you tell me about the denominator how many . how many pieces of fractions is made out of it all
okay how many pieces of the fraction is made out of it all all right so could i say it s the number of pieces altogether yes okay so if the denominator is the number of pieces altogether what is the numerator
way it s pieces like the number of pieces that what to take away to take away yeah okay
away like . like take of the fraction to take it out of the fraction okay what else can you tell me about the numerator or the denominator
me 10 divided by 5 but is that how i would . how i would . how i would say my fraction i mean 10 and . you keep thinking about that
n one and 11 and 14th is okay you re saying to me one and 14th no is part of it a fraction
of the . the 14th is okay so the 14th is my fraction what s the one the whole the whole number okay fraction so let s look talk about 14th for a minute because that s a mixed number fraction 14th what part of 14th is the numerator what number is the numerator
one the one so the 4 must be the denominator tell me what one what does 14th mean say it again equals 4 does 14th equal 4 no if . yes
41 out of 4 so 14th means one out of 4 so give me an example of when i would talk about one out of 4 j . when would i talk about one out of 4
here and i could i say that one out of 4 students over here is a girl yes yes yes that works mean 25% is a girl and 5% is a boy say that again
and 75% are boys okay so if i wanted to change it percentage wise 25% are girls 75% are boys mean what does the 4 represent in this . in this idea what how many like how many things are in all okay so how many things are in all how many students in this case
44 okay so the denominator s representing the total number in the group or the whole and the numerator s representing the the the pieces the piece or the part that we re talking about okay so the numerator is the piece or the part that we re talking about the denominator is how many pieces the whole is cut into
fraction one and no 2 and i don t want a whole number and a fraction i just want a fraction okay . 4 and 5 tenths no 4 and 5 you re mixing in a whole number in there every time you say and you ve put a whole number in the 4 fifths 4 fifths is a fraction
so i could say that . i ate 4 fifths of the cake last night altogether 55 so you know what a fraction is i m just asking you a different way from what you re used to thinking about it okay you should move if you can t see
this is not like a 20 minute so my next was what are the parts of the fraction well jumped right ahead and she said well numerator and denominator but i ve got another term in there another term for the parts of my fraction fraction bar fraction bar what s the fraction bar
do it separates the numerator from the denominator it separates the numerator from the denominator it s the line and remember in 5th grade with teacher a and teacher b we are always writing our fractions in this form so that they are vertical we are not using the slanty slanty we re using the vertical straight across
okay what other things do you know and can you tell me about fractions about we can also think of this as division division this can be thought of as one divided by 4 remember when we talked about division we showed looked at all the different ways to write division
okay but today we re going to look at them as fractions
class he s taking a fraction class okay so he said to me this morning do you know what this is and i laughed at him
one a unit fraction is any fraction where the numerator is one means sounds so complicated it sounds so complicated and so fancy but that s all that means today if he talks about it you can tell him you know what it means it just means that you re talking about a fraction where the numerator is one
whole it s all it means okay 0 i think we could have moving in the i have a question to ask question how much money do i have up there ooh ooh
wow you guys are killing me today because you re just like jumping right ahead to the whole thing dollar how would you . how would you write that not using words numbers 11 half on half so i have 2 quarters up there
cents knows that ¢50 is equal to one half of a dollar because he s a smarty pants today okay one half how much money do i have there ¢50 ¢50 now s telling me that s half of a dollar so if it s half of a dollar it s ¢50 out of what
¢10100 so do these 2 fractions equal each other yes yes one half is equal to 50 hundredths what another fraction that s equal to one half
no 3 sixths 3 sixths okay is 3 sixths equal to one half yes yes d 2 fifths i mean 2 fourths 2 fourths what s another fraction
500 thousandths ooh big numbers my gentlemen today 500 thousandths 25 fiftieths 25 fiftieths 75175100 fiftieths
7 fourteenths say it again honorable k tenths 5 tenths how do you know that all of those fractions are equal to one half
how do you know all of those fractions are equal to one half neighbor explain to your neighbor how you know they re all equal to one half c and meet in the middle so you can talk
i m trying to figure out that s there are 25 of us -2 today all you do is
partners okay what did you and your partner decide say that again
because it s half of the denominator what s half of the denominator the . the numerator because the numerator is equal to half of the denominator agree okay how did your group discuss it we multiplied the numerator twice and you get the denominator what do you mean you multiply the numerator twice
like 50 +50 times wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you said multiply the numerator twice the she took it for example 50 +50 yeah they both i got confused because you re telling me take the numerator and multiply it twice means but then for your example you told me 50 +50
times your explanation said add i m being very picky about your explanation right now so think about that let s start with the numerator how did you say it again multiply the numerator twice okay what does that mean i want . i want to be a little more precise with her words
100 okay so . so you re saying multiply the numerator times 2 thing to me that means something else so you re saying take the numerator and multiply it by 2 and it should equal the denominator
n you just have to add the same number twice what same number like 3 +3 equals 6 and where . where did you get your 3 and add it to the same number add it to itself and you get the denominator so you should get the denominator so is taking a number and adding it to itself the same as multiplying by 2
c their the numerator s divide you would multiply it by 2 and it gets the denominator multiply the numerator times 2 will equal the denominator
c . multiply the numerator times 2 and it will equal the denominator and divide the denominator by 2 and it will equal the numerator so instead of taking the numerator and multiplying it by 2 you re saying i can also take the denominator instead and divide it by 2
k if the numerator s the denominator twice if i can divide the numerator into the denominator is that what you re saying 2 times if the . if the numerator goes into the denominator twice so if i can divide the . the numerator into the denominator 2 times it there it s equal to one half
this we re all pretty comfortable with that okay i want to talk about another way up all of my fractions on this the board are equal
what a half one half not a half one half one half because i don t know how to write a half because a to me is a letter one half okay so all of my fractions on the board are equal to one another equal a math word for equal that also begins with the letter e
equivalent equivalent so today we re going to talk about some equivalent fractions board all of those fractions are equivalent to one another they re all equal to one another and that s what equivalent means
equal okay so we re going to be talking about some equivalent fractions
fractions when i m talking about equivalent and equal fractions i m not changing the size of my fraction or my whole i m just changing the way i m thinking about it okay
so when i go from and i say that one half is equal to 3 sixths my whole the size of my whole is not changing
same the number of pieces i divide my whole into will change okay there s a multiplication property that works here that enables me to do this what do you think
you is it you go like with x you multiply 6 times one and 3 times 2 like okay say that again you multiply 6 times one and 3 times 2 and what will that get me 16th okay but . is that bringing me to my equivalent fractions or is that proving that they re equivalent
proving that they re equivalent okay but i don t i m not talking right now about proving they re equivalent now how do i start with one fraction and make or find name another fraction that s equal to it okay and it involves the number one does anyone know how to write the number one as a fraction
whole the value one as a fraction one and 00 what what is that a fraction that s a whole number i want a fraction if i have the whole pizza 0
it i can write my fraction my . my number one because i have that whole pizza well we know when you buy a pizza it s usually cut into pieces 0 but if we haven t taken any of those pieces away because i m not sharing them they re all mine what is it going to be
8 eighths 88s so i can write one as the fraction 8 eighths what s another fraction that equals one whole 2 seconds 2 seconds or 2 halves 2 over 2
c 3 thirds 3 thirds 5 fifths 5 fifths
4 fourths 4 fourths can someone looking at this give me a rule or a conjecture apply if i want to write one whole as a fraction how can i write it no matter what
j your numerator has my numerator and my denominator are going to be the same number or they re going to be equal the same number because remember when we go back to thinking about fractions as division what does 3 divided by 3 equal equal 12 divided by 215 divided by 514 divided by 411
okay so to find my equivalent fractions i m going to come up with a real good ugly looking fraction 4 sevenths okay i want to find a fraction that is equivalent to 4 sevenths honest if you give me a round pie or a cake or a pizza i can t cut 7 pieces
way i can t cut that so let s think about put your hands down put your hands down let s think about multiplication because i m going to give you that much of a hint we re going to use multiplication to find an equivalent fraction for 4 sevenths let s think about some of our multiplication properties
rules our properties the commutative property property 0 those so long ago before christmas property do you think the 0 property will help me get anywhere 00 what one of those properties might help us k do we need to say properties yes please
 . i think it s commutative i don t have my factors yet 0 ooh look at what information we have on the board so far we ve talked about how to write one whole as a fraction and we know we re going to use some multiplication in there
j by identities identity property what does the identity property tell us any factor multiplied by one equals that factor so if i take my 4 sevenths and i i should have let my 11 year old make my slide presentation
if i take my 4 sevenths and you give me any fraction that equals one whole i can give you an equivalent fraction so huh give me a fraction that equals one whole
again 03 thirds 3 thirds so i m going to take 4 sevenths i m going to multiply it by 3 thirds and i know that 3 thirds is equal to whole and my answer is going to be an equivalent fraction to 4 sevenths it s going to equal 4 sevenths so let s start off with what does 4 times 3 equal
1212 what does 7 times 3 equal
2121 so i am saying to you 4 sevenths is equal to 1220 firsts 12 out of 21 that s too okay right now we re just looking to find equal fractions
denominator common denominator was talking about that when we re talking about adding and subtracting fractions okay and we are going to use equivalent fractions to get to common denominators eventually but today we re just looking to see equivalent fractions changed my pizza is still that same size but now you re telling me instead of cutting it into 7 pices you think i can cut it into 21 pieces
dang i don t think i can
can can someone find me another equivalent fraction to 4 sevenths that i might actually be able to make that my number of slices 8 fourteenths how did you get to 8 fourteenths i multiplied 4 sevenths times 2 what do you mean times 2
2 seconds 2 halves 2 halves so 4 sevenths times 2 halves equals 8 fourteenths so i can say that 4 sevenths is equal to 8 fourteenths are we in agreement yes yes because the 2 halves represents one whole
i noticed that when you re multiplying 4 sevenths every time you multiply by a 2 like 8 fourteenths it s going to be you re going to have to add 3 like it s going to be separated by . 4 sevenths is separated by 3 i don t want to look at my 4 sevenths as a subtraction problem
us okay 4 out of 7 is saying that i m talking about 4 out of the 77 but we don t want to look at that at this point okay slices i i don t know
let s try it with an easier number because i m not good at this . this cutting of pie thing see what if i give you a fraction . i can do this i can cut something into 4 pieces
i m pretty good at 4s and i m gong to keep 3 fourths for myself today so what would be an equivalent fraction for 3 fourths because 0 i have more people coming over now and it s not just the 4 of us in the house
house what if i were to say to you that instead of cutting it into 4 pieces initially i needed to cut it into 16 i m going to take my whole and cut my whole into 16 pieces 3 fourths is going to be equal to how many sixteenths how did i get from my 4 to my 16
c multiply by 4 i multiply by 4 so what is my fraction going to be time it s on the tip of your tongue it you told me that to get from 4 to 16 i multiplied by 4 and now i m asking you what is my fraction in here
one whole 4 fourths because i re wrote my one whole as 4 fourths okay so i started out with 3 fourths 3 out of 4 i multiplied it by 4 fourths what how many out of 16 will i now have 1212 did the size of the cake change
changed the amount the number of pieces i cut it into into did i change the portion i m keeping for myself no why did i change the amount that i m getting
the size that i m getting because there s more people coming and they re going to have to need more pieces but that wasn t my question myself i said i was keeping 3 fourths to myself so now i m keeping 12 sixteenths to myself is the amount of cake the piece the size that i m keeping for myself changing 0 yes is the size changing the size isn t changing
case instead of keeping 3 pieces for myself how many pieces did i keep 12 but did the amount of cake change c i was just stretching okay let s try one more
fraction what s your favorite fraction fraction 0 give me your favorite fraction 6 sixths 6 sixths 0 that s boring 06 sevenths 60 we did sevenths already
give me something else eighths ooh 6 eighths okay 6 eighths give me an equivalent fraction give me a fraction equal to 6 eighths how are we going to find it 7 ninths is 7 ninths equal to 6 eighths how d you get there
how are you getting from 6 eighths to 7 ninths are you using multiplication to get there there multiplication of one but we re using re writing our one as a fraction right 3 thirds equals one so think about that that way
think about a fraction you can multiply 6 eighths times
k 1820 fourths 1820 fourths she s telling me 6 eighths is equal to 1820 fourths she multiplied 6 eighths times one but she used that one was what fraction form for that one
fraction 3 thirds 3 thirds do you agree that 6 times 3 equals 18 yes do you agree that 8 times 3 equals 24 yes so is did she give mean equivalent fraction so is did she give me an equivalent fraction you okay so i m saving my 6 eighths because that s s favorite
you and i have we multiplied 6 eighths times one whole but we wrote our one whole as 3 thirds can you give me a fraction that s equal to one whole think don t turn around and 2 what
2s 2 halves 22s 2 halves sometimes when you tell me 22s i get confused and i think we re talking about ballet tutus 0 what s my equivalent fraction going to be 12 sixteenths 12 sixteenths agree does 6 eighths equal 12 sixteenths yes
yes yes so an easy way for us to find equivalent fractions is to take a fraction that is equal to one whole and multiply our original fraction times it love i know i was no there is no response put it in your desk see now i m going to come back and i m going to ask you some questions
equivalent if something is equivalent what does that mean give me a one word definition for equivalent equivalent equal if something is equivalent it is equal my it s like having puppies take out the red tickets and we have an answer what s a unit fraction
what s a unit fraction . it s . any fraction any fraction that . that is has has . 0 i got it the the numerator any fraction that has one in the numerator
that was painful i think she should only get half a ticket on that deal how can i write one whole as a fraction 8 eighths 8 eighths but that s an example explanation . okay you re speaking to my heart
explanation what do you know has to be going on in the fraction for it to be equal to one whole minds what has to be going on in the numerator and the denominator in order for the fraction to be equal to one whole a it has to be the same the numerator and the denominator have to be the same number they have to be equal for it to equal one whole i had another question
now question what was my other 0 that was my other question what multiplication property tells me that i can take any fraction and multiply it by one in this case that we re writing one as a fraction to find another equivalent fraction go ahead a property
the identity property tells me that i multiply any fraction times one i get an equal fraction fraction 0 you weren t in the room when i made that announcement this morning was she no what did i specifically say do not ask me during out lesson snack snack don t ask me about snack during my lesson
okay were we impressed slightly by my powerpoint today yes we fib so well when we want snack all right you re going to do some work now yay see what if instead of . yeah
when i m talking about equivalent fractions am i always always always going to be making it larger or are there cases where maybe i m going to be making it smaller can i go from a larger fraction to a smaller number yes
ways okay so for example on the screen the 2nd picture that has the 2 triangles unfortunately you cannot see it very well the 1st fraction is 4 sixths so i want you to shade in 4 out of the 6 of the 1st triangle
we will start using my fraction pizza game yes it s a really cool fraction pizza game you have to build pizzas 0 cardboard pizzas yes you may sharpen your pencil
i looks a little bit clearer this way doesn t it yes so we re only looking right now at b and if i bring it down low enough i can reach it and if i bring it in really close you can possibly see it
so what i said to you was on the 1st triangle there are 4 out of 6 shaded in
and on the 2nd one . there would be this many shaded in and we re looking to see if this is equivalent i m on b i m on the triangles and unfortunately the rizzo does not make dark copies on the shading so the 1st triangle on the left we have 4 sixths of this triangle shaded in
what fraction of the 2nd triangle is shaded in 2 thirds 2 thirds 2 out of the 3 pieces are shaded in
so on our paper we can write that 4 sixths is equal to 2 thirds okay so sometimes when we re talking about equivalent fractions we re not always talking about making the number of pieces bigger sometimes we re going to talk about making it a smaller number of pieces
changed when i took my original triangle and had it cut into 6 pieces and we shaded in 4 and took the same equivalent triangle and congruent triangle same size same shape and we shaded in the same amount but we cut had fewer pieces did the amount shaded in change
no no okay let s go back and look at a for a minute
so on the 2nd square what is our fraction
3 fourths is equal to how many eighths 7 eighths i think we better double check our counting 6 eighths double check your counting eighths double check your counting 6 eighths you colored in too many
look at mine i just colored you colored in more than i did 7 so let s think let s think about this if we didn t have the picture if we don t have the picture to look at how did you get from 4 to 8 times say it again
times times 2 so if i didn t have the picture to look at i can say well 4 times 2 equals 8 so if i m using 2 as my denominator for my fraction that s equal to one what would be the what would my numerator have to be 2 it would be 3 fourths times 2 over 2
66 so does 6 eighths match my picture that okay sometimes it s harder using the pictures than it is just to do the straight math okay let s look at c
c gives us c gives us some circles on c the 1st circle is cut into how many pieces 222 and how many pieces should be shaded in
one so on the 1st circle one piece should be shaded in on circle number 2 how many should i shade in out so you re telling me that one half is equal to 4 tenths
no but that s what you just told me to shade in 4 true how many should i shade in 6 i m looking for hands 5 i m looking for hands because i m getting silly answers 5 because 5 times i i m down here
5 because 5 is half of 10 that s a good explanation because in order for a fraction to be equal to one half the numerator has to be half of the denominator
this how could you use the identity property to explain how this works how can i represent one whole as a fraction to use the identity property to make to prove one half equals 5 tenths
 . 4 times 10 and then no 0 ooh my identity property says any factor times one equals that number right right
and we said that if we write a fraction that is equal to one whole and we multiply it times another fraction the fraction that we get as an answer is going to be equivalent so what fraction that equals one whole can i multiply times one half to equal 5 tenths will 2 halves work
it yes she wants to try 2 halves does one times 2 equal 5 no does 2 times 2 equal 10 no then i can t use that fraction
2 halves how do i get using multiplication from 125 how do i get using multiplication from 2 to 10 try does one times 5 equal 5
yes does 2 times 5 equal 10 yes so there s another way to prove our answer
so for this example we can use the question of is our numerator half of our denominator and we can use the identity property multiplying the fraction times a fraction that is equal to one whole okay now i there s no more pictures no more pictures we re going to have to use some math facts
0 my goodness tell me about 6 twelfths what do i know about that fraction 0 it s . it s a half it s . half it s not a half it s equal to one half one half so if 6 halves . 6 excuse me
6 twelfths is equal to one half i need to find a fraction now that has 6 in the denominator that is equal to one half so what question can i ask myself about 6633 so can i say that 6 twelfths is equal to 3 sixths yes
okay ooh letter e 13rd what new vocabulary word did you learn today that you re going to impress teacher k with unit fraction unit fraction 0
unit fraction unit fraction i have 13rd if it s just me my husband and my daughter in the house i can take that cake and cut it into 3 pieces we each get 13rd slices big slices of cake what if i decide that instead i should cut it into sixths because we shouldn t eat that much cake
how many slices would we each get 3 are you sure 2 because 3 times 2 is 63 times 2 equals 6 so what would my fraction that is equal to one be you tell me that 2 is my denominator so what s my numerator
ooh ooh what did you tell me equals you were right with what you told me 13rd equals 62 sixths how do you get from one to 2 using multiplication times 22 so my fraction that equals one whole is going to be 2 halves because one times 2 equals 2
3 times 2 equals 6 so we re each are we each still getting 13rd of the cake yes yes but instead of having one piece each we re each going to get 2 pieces 2 pieces are those 2 pieces going to be bigger than the one piece
no they re going to be the same amount just like we had with our pictures up top
changing 16th equals how many twelfths 16th is equal to how many twelfths i m looking to see from people i haven t heard from
i haven t heard from a couple people today and i m surprised you haven t heard from 0 yes i have l because and
our . fraction would be . 2 halves 16th times 2 halves equals 2 twelfths okay we learned quite a bit today denominator you learn the name for the line that separates the numerator and denominator
question what was that called fraction bar fraction bar the line that separates the numerator and the denominator you ve learned what a unit fraction is so that you can impress teacher k you ve reviewed again what equivalent means
learn we learned what equivalent 0 yeah equivalent . that you could multiply . yeah that you could multiply 2 a whole number what whole number that you could show a whole number by a fraction what whole number
number a particular whole number like and what would that particular whole number be one and i can represent my one whole as as what
whole 6 sixths 6 sixths how else can i represent it 2420 fourths 2420 fourths what s up dude band today so can you tell me a generalization about what it means you ve just given me examples of how to write one whole as a fraction
examples can you give me a general explanation how do i represent one whole as a fraction the . the numerator when the numerator and the denominator are the same number now look at this one this example up here 5 tenths equals some number of sixths now when i looked at that i went 0
0 i don t know i i can t multiply by 10 to get to 6 i can t divide 10 by anything to get to 6 do and i want to leave you with that thought for now how am i going to solve that
centers i m going to go over the centers and then we re going to start tables 2 and 5 whenever you move to 2 and 5 you re going to be coming to the round table okay tables one and 4 you re going to be working on quick images
directions it s the same thing we did yesterday as a whole class and there are the cards with the quick images half the time you re going to spend at half math half the time you ll do quick images so each time you move table 4 will start at fast math 1st for 15 minutes while table one does quick images okay at table 6 you ll be doing number puzzles
independently you have a number puzzles recording sheet and the puzzles are in a bag carefully and at table 3 you re going to be doing division 2 ways today b i have left an index card that has the people that will be doing group a b so make sure you read the directions carefully to know which group you re working with
it s just practicing the algorithm and big 7
started people at tables 2 and 5 come and see me at the u table
do you remember yesterday you started on volume
yes for practice we re going to start off with these little boxes that i already have cut out we talked about strategy for finding the volume of each box
started we ll look at the face of it and that will determine the length and width and we said we d draw the base on there yeah why don t you go ahead and do that out so what is the length of the box
the base i should say the length 2 on and what s the width 2 now what s the height of the box 4 you see 4 layers tall right so write 4
and then what did we say the formula is for finding the volume general length times width times height length times width times height then is right that it s going to be 2 times 2 times 4 with this box 16 so the volume for this box would be 16
shape who thinks that they can draw the base of a box
one i think it s less smudged good does everyone agree with that that s the base of the box
job can you find the length and label it there does everyone agree with that the length is 6 okay who did not get to write something yet
you do the width the length is how far it goes up and the width is how far it goes across usually when you say the length the longer side is the length and the width is how wide it is wide so does everyone agree with it s 3 cubes wide
height who thinks that they can label the height volume length times width times height that s right
36 36 that s right we re going to try making some boxes again so this is very similar to the activity we did yesterday
again you re going to be working with partners e and you ll work with and then and will work together directions it says what is the volume the number of cubes that fit of each box determine the number of cubes 1st and then build the box and use cubes to check so you re going to look at the pattern 1st
you re going to determine the number of cubes that you think will fit in the box and put that as your 1st answer then you re going to build the box fill it with cubes and get the actual answer okay just like we did yesterday while you re doing that i m going to be looking at what each group is doing carefully and make sure we re on the right track i like that some of you are already using that strategy where you re drawing the base of the box in
at some point you d like to be able to figure it out without having to actually build the box number so talk together with your group very good that s good that s why you have a partner to help you with this so that eventually if you do your papers one of you can build it
it you can switch off
once you draw in the base it helps you right to figure out where the sides are going to need to go do i have to make just the outside this picture you re making the amount of cubes right so you need a one by 4 by 4
you teacher yes
did i do this right because if it s like in the picture like this so i think is that one by 4 by 4 yeah it s one row high and there s 44 in each so one times 4 times 4
wide so remember one of the strategies we talked about is you don t tape all the sides of the boxes tape and remember we like to try and look at the picture of the lines running outside this tape is still sticking on 0 really here you can put that in between you and
thank you you are welcome teacher when is it blocking the camera no it doesn t matter just pretend it s not there it s more important that you understand what you re doing in math than what they ve got on that camera yesterday i wasn t so sure about this but now i understand it that s why we re doing it at the table today so that if you don t practice so we know that we re all secure in what we re doing
and it can get tricky cause you re not used to always doing 3 d stuff you re used to a lot of 2 d shapes we did this last year but the shapes we did weren t as big they were small cubes
yeah some of them look so good boxes are coming along well you had set the timer right
yeah okay how much time do you have left okay can you let me know when you have 5 minutes just so i ll tell the other group that looks good does it matter what side we leave open no
side you just want to leave one side open so that you can slide the cubes in side then remember once you finish the box then you re going to count the number of cubes you were able to fit in it and write it under your actual answer okay
right very good is that 16 cubes okay the actual answer is 16 right yep good can we go on to number 2
yeah as soon as we re done we ll go to number 2 can you do me a favor desk i ll put it right here and make a scrap for the height is it how far it goes up or how many rows it is
is so you should be counting from the corner out 3 right you can just slide it under the table
let s count this one more time one 2 3 4 5 3 and that s 30 i m not good at this it s too high too wide
yeah too wide that s okay
practice remember we talked about everybody has different strengths so some things that might come really fast to you might take someone else more time
fit so just erase that because you want to make sure you have 3 layers around it so that you can fit so it would be better if i start in the middle yeah then start drawing it across way 0 the long way so 2 and go up 5
way let me show you so when you look at it you kind of think where is the base going to go
side so one 2 3 4 5 one 2 across and then you go 3 layers up and each side okay thank you you are welcome what happened here
teacher on this picture next time we need to redraw it so just don t cut and redraw and that should be enough room okay this next time you re going to have to redraw it okay got it
on this paper it says it goes 3 but it only goes 2 wide so this side is only going to be 2 wide but it s going to be 3 layers tall 0 i see and there i go up 3
and then over 2 and see now it fits
fits so were you right 30 cubes fit so you can put 30 how much time do you have left people at table one you need to clean up because you re going to get ready to move to fast math
everybody else keep going if you guys are having trouble with the number puzzles you can work together
3 so they re telling you length times width times height so what s 3 by 4 by 3 fit cause 3 times 4 is multiplication so 3 times 4 is
you can do 3 by 4 yeah
easier that s all right like i said with practice see it s standing up a little bit better yeah so does 30 cubes work box yeah and did it work
very good
10 wrong one that s okay so when you draw it it s going to be what 3 so it s going to be length times width times height right 4 so i just take it up and 4 goes 4 that way
now so the base is going to be 3 is going to be one side 4 4 yeah and then how many layers tall is it going to be 3 3 yeah i got it
3 yeah so this is going to be the base and then you just have to build it 3 layers tall so i this and then i do the same thing but just go 3 layers up up and you can just pop this one up that way it won t stick out if i can get it in
make sure you re working with your group here have one of your partners help you
this looks good
3 okay did you draw a box yet
so you re going to draw the next box okay
right you need to make sure you have room to make it 3 layers high
are you going to be able to make the sides 3 layers
you need to move it over cause on this side you d only have a box with 2 layers this is hard do you see 3 by 4 by 3 right 3 by 4 by 3
remember it s only 4 layers 3 by 4
so it goes up and across 4 yeah
then i think it goes to the same thing on the next side and then the next side it just fills in or on the side it just looks like this 3 by 3
later remember during math we talk about math sorry that s all right are you going to have enough room to draw the side yes at the bottom how many layers tall does it have to be
that do you need to add from another paper
on if it s 4 by 2 it stops here here so tell me what the dimensions are
6 so label them 2 4 label the dimensions right there so it s 2 by 4 by 6 right okay so then why are you extending the sides so much
the sides should start it should only go as far as the bottom of the box you know what it was i wasn t getting it because i was looking at this one
wait a minute i was doing number 5
so now you re going to need to add some stuff right that s just what it looks like there s no base no there is a base look see 4 and 2
that s 4 and 2 8 8 square units how would i build this to on your timer how much time is left okay in about 4 minutes we re going to be switching so try to finish up what you re working on
how am i supposed to do this you have to cut out your pattern and then we ll tape these on okay here you re probably going to have to tape 2 pieces together so you have enough do you see what i m saying
want i don t understand how i would make on this i m not sure where to start because that s just the the 2 doesn t go over here 2 then how many layers tall is it 6 so 6 by 4 by 2
48 48 that s right we re actually going to have to start to clean up okay okay this goes in your class work folder and you can put your paper in your class work folder you re going to have to put 2 pieces together so we ll do that tomorrow okay
you shouldn t have stopped until the timer went off
is the timer going off okay okay people at table 3 please make sure the 5 dice end up back in the bag
that people at table 4 make sure all the cubes are put back together and make sure all the cards are back in their zip lock bag no one is getting up and moving yet because we didn t say it s time to go yet can you make sure all the cards end up back in the bag please
you your group can head back to that table just so you re ready to move
1st i would move my stuff over and then all right you guys can head back to those 2 tables so you re ready to move
e okay it looks like the far side is ready to move is your group can move to where s group is
here are you almost done finding those cards
floor your group can head to there and go right on the computers
a length plus length length plus not plus length times width times height length time width times height i have a box right here what was the strategy we used yesterday to try and figure out the volume for this box
finding length times width times height we are g finding the base of the box because the base of the box will help us to start to identify dimensions can you find the base of the box i have another shape you ll get to try
does everyone agree with that that s the base of the box yes so who can tell me the length of the base of the box 2 so you can go ahead and write that bottom so what is the width of the box
2 put that down please and focus on what we re doing box
height yeah people at table one if you not sure what to do look at the directions there so when we talk about the height we re talking about how many layers tall the box is going to be once we put it together
4 so what is the volume of this box if it s 2 by 2 by 4 16 so do you want to try to draw the base on that box remember the length is how long the base is is the height is how many layers tall the box is going to be
okay that s going to be a rectangle yep well it ll be a square prism cause the base is a square
box who can find the length how long the box is
inside okay why does this box so this is the width so that s 3 yeah who can tell me the height of the box how tall the box is
3 this is the width when we look at the height we look at this outside edges how many layers tall right so if this box is 6 by 3 by 2 what is the volume of this box 6 by 3 by 2
6 times 3 is how much 36 so the volume is 36 more then we re going to move on to a different activity we ll see when we get to it
box i already know the volume just wait width what is the length of the box
3 that s why you ve got to be paying attention 3 said the length is 3 2 and how high
2 so if the dimensions of this box are 3 by 2 by 2 what is the volume 12 3 times 2 is 6 okay what we re going to be doing today is similar to what we did yesterday partner so you ll work with
a and then you ll work with and to make the boxes okay so just like yesterday they give you a pattern and a picture you re going to use the pattern 1st to identify the number of cubes that you think will fit in the box
then you re going to build the box and fill it with cubes to check what the actual answer is remember what s a strategy that we talked about for finding out the volume boxes draw draw the base right that s pretty easy so start to work with your group
answer teacher that s right right let me see you draw the base of your box
right so one of you can draw the box and one of you can use the cubes to build the shape that s going to go inside we re not going to have enough cubes that s 16 cubes and you ve got 2 rows of 10
enough i mean between just one i need 2 more
is that right 4 and one 16 by one right because the length is 4 and the width is one and the height is 4 right so that s 16 right did you put your answer yet
on did you put your answer what is the dimensions it s 4 by one by 4 that what is 4 times 4 times one 4 times 4 is 16 one so write 16
answer 4 long right one wide 4 high so that looks right remember you only have to tape you can leave one side un taped so it s easy to put the cubes in
tape put this between you guys to tape the boxes is that okay good 4 by one by 4 tall right so go ahead and cut that out
how much time is left on that okay 4 minutes for that group to switch not for you to leave not yet
time remember when you fold your box you want to make nice crisp folds so then the box will stand up better and then you do 2 more it looks kind of like one of those football things hold on we want to try to fold it so the line is on the outside on the box
i m just going to show you when you fold it fold it like this
right then who s going to tape okay will tape and cut somebody has to do 2 jobs
he did the drawing and now he s going to do the taping
this stuff is kind of easy you think it s easy yeah back in 4th grade in the old school we were doing volumes yeah i think in 4th grade here some of the other kids is that working is it 4 long
set does it fit so you re all set
people at table one you need to put the cubes together quickly bag so we re switching no we re not just that table
so you guys can head right back to your table and get started on quick images can you put the cards in that zip lock bag
did you have a question you re going to go to this table and do your quick images that s okay you can put them in this way
16 cubes right hold on 12nd why don t you have your answer
base then are you setting the timer
3 so what s 5 by 2 by 3
30 30 yeah focus on what you re doing focus on what you re doing were you able to draw it correctly okay
next time you should be able to fit it if you adjust it the right amount on right 2 by 5
2 we ll probably be finished in like 10 minutes then can i have some more sure let her cut it cause she needs to have an activity
she cut last time but she didn t get i let her tape that s okay apart this is 2 by 5 right you need to erase this
remember if you need to if it makes it easier look at it this way
5 how many layers tall does the side have to be 3 so you have to go over 3 you have to make sure it s the same as that side of the box so when you start this one you have to start it right here cause you want the sides to cover the base so you go up 3 right so show me how far over you re going to go
how long is this side across yes no 2 people can work on it
since you re in a group of 3 that s fine why are you cutting it out now
okay that s cool are your cubes ready yep he s just putting and your is that right i know what the actual answer is 30 because there s 15 on each side so is that right
3 okay you did it right and then 3 layers tall okay and that worked so now you re ready to move on to the next thing
so if it s 3 by 4 by 3 what do you do with those numbers to figure out the 1st answer 3 3 times 4 is 12 right so now you have to plan out your box 3 by 4 by 3 base you want to do it right in the middle so you have enough room yes
because sometimes you might only get the dimensions volume you need to wait for your group though because your group is not done
worked the dimensions are 3 by 4 by 3 the base of the box is 3 by 4 and 10 it s 3 layers tall
keep working
away is this right teacher 3 by 4 by 3 that s right did you already draw the box
who s drawing the box though you need to draw it so you need to get started cubes okay here use this 3 by 4 by 3
i feel like you re in 3 different places right now
together we did 2 right we ll keep our boxes right here doing what s the 1st step when you make these 3 by 4 by 3 answer you said the dimensions of this box are 3 by 4 by 3
0 i got the answer you didn t write it down you said 30 was your 1st answer and 30 was what you ended up filling it with
dimensions you can list them you re up here number 3 3 by 4 by 3 so the length the width and the height 36 now you re going to design your box
3 so in the center i would draw a 3 by 4 in the center because you need room to make the sides of the box hold on
you ve got to go 4 down and then 4 over so there s the bottom of your box ahead and then how many layers tall is it going to be
3 i got the base done there you go now it s got to go over because it s to completely cover the sides
4 is this the base yes would this be right these 2 sides is the box well let s see 4 so you need to cut one layer off right
3 you want to know how many cubes the whole thing fits so you can t leave empty spaces that s right 3 very good over do we still have 3 here no you have to go all the way over because you want to cover the whole side
okay how many minutes are left on that timer
you here you go
out the quick images center i want you to start to clean up okay okay everybody else keep going for a couple more minutes
that s okay you need one more yeah because it needs to be 3 by 4 right so work together to figure it out
world very good so you know that you have 36 you needed your 1st answer you probably won t have a lot of time to build it today but at least come up
l can you check that there s 5 dice and put those in the bag i want you guys to start to put your cubes back into i want you guys to finish this up
good put this in your class work folder for now and then you re going to start to put those into rows of 10 g that s okay
thank you alright today today we are not going to collect our homework or anything because we have 2 big things we have to finish okay 1st thing we have to start talking a little bit about some algebra and i ve got some information on the board we re going to talk about in a minute
and then we re going to do some review because our math crct test is next wednesday and you know one thing we haven t even talked about for a while that s graphs so we want to make sure we have plenty of time plus this is a friday so that means we have to be done a little early so we can go back so everybody can go back to their own home rooms okay alright does anybody have any questions before we get started
yes we will be checking homework at the end we re going to save that until monday we ll save our homework until monday from yesterday yes are we going to have homework next week probably not but let s wait and see can we just wait and see it s kinda going to depend on whether i think you need a little bit more review
yes next week will we be doing a packet in math we ll go over you know that packet we did earlier this week we ll go over it then do i need you if you have your your math folder with you i need you to get that out down so if you don t have it just get out a piece of notebook paper please notebook paper
okay you want to get some notebook paper from back there just for those who don t have any ready is there notebook paper above it
some that s our writing paper if you wouldn t mind just putting that down you know what let s just get this paper this will be good that s fine will you pass that out good alright today we have 2 essential questions
board the 1st one says what is an expression and the 2nd what is a variable are you all waiting for paper do i d like you to write down the essential questions and then list the 2 vocabulary words that we need to make sure that we know
the 1st one is expression and the 2nd one is variable year but now we re going to start using the names okay the proper names so please write down the definition for expression
d expressions is a mathematical phrase that uses numbers and operations signs but no equal signs okay did you see how i underlined double underlined no no equal sign because then it would be an equation we talked about equations before 5 +2 equals 7 that s an equation and we also have called it a number sentence do you remember that
yes okay so an expression is a mathematical phrase that uses numbers and operation signs but not equal sign expression 3 times n and the answer is 24 but we don t have an equal sign there
okay so please write that down as an example next to expression is that s exactly right you ve probably done some of this on success maker good you said you want us to write down expression i do i want you to write down that word that vocabulary word we need to know that
please the definition yes okay do you have that copied down babe the example 3 times n is 24 do we write that down please write that remember how we usually just write example
sorry there s an example for an expression why don t we write what n equals well i just went ahead and i just wrote this but we ll find out what the n is later we don t need to find that out for this particular example but could you tell just from that expression what an n would equal
that so somewhere down the road we re going to learn that we re going to say n equals 8 out and is this isn t this stuff that you already know good so now we re just going to be using the correct mathematical vocabulary my pencil got stuck in there it s too small okay we don t put anything too small in there honorable but that s here we ll just unplug it
it okay is that the only pencil you have yes you re going to have to use the hand pencil sharpener there you go run over there
faster alright so now let s move on to our 2nd vocabulary word that s going to help us with what we re going to talk about today and that is variable quickly get it written down we can t start our activities until we know all of the definitions
okay a letter or symbol that can stand for an unknown number and it s any unknown number alright a letter or symbol that can stand for any unknown number i know that you have been using phrases like this mathematical phrases since you were in 1st grade
where you had triangle +3 whoops so sorry and that should be an equal so sorry honorable triangle +3 equals 10 i actually have 2 and that s using a symbol yes okay and then i used a number i mean a letter with numbers
so a letter or a symbol so i used the letter n and in the next expression actually equation yes i know the answer the 1st question okay well tell us the 1st triangle +3 equals 10 7 +3 equals 10 equals 7 good how about the next one
n -8 equals 12 so n equals 20 20 because 20 -8 equals 12 right we ve been having do you all agree we have been doing this all along okay good so i don t want it to look different to you it s just now you know what are we going to call when we see the symbol or a letter what are we going to call those
use expression not expression when we see a symbol like the triangle or when we see a letter like an n what are we going to call it a variable a variable everybody say that word variable variable and a variable changes so we re going to find out why that why that is today alright okay give you just a few more minutes make sure you have everything written down
how is it that n equals 20 when n equals 8 well this is a multiplication symbol 3 times n equals 24 honorable are we going to use this paper the whole time no but we might need it for something else so keep it handy
so do you see we can change n is a variable so that means it can cha it can stand for different numbers just according to what kind of expression you re using or if you re using an equation it yes alright now turn your paper over i m going to give you a couple of examples
this can i use the back of the paper sure you can use the back of the paper i can t see sorry let me move over
paper yeah like if it s sure because this is all going to be about equations and variables okay
minute who thinks they could come up with another expression i gave you one example while we re waiting for people to finish 21 ooh equal since it s yours call on somebody to answer that
one 8 times n equals 0 basic fact call on somebody to see if they know it
wait 8 times 8 equals 64 equals 8 good does it only have to be a multiplication problem no it can be any operation sign by the way remember these are the operations signs aren t they
we ve got could it be division it could be division addition subtraction those are all operation signs remember you 9 times n equals 81 9 times n equals 81 alright call on somebody to solve that one
9 alright go ahead come up with something other than multiplication 20 minus . and does it have to be an n
it it could be a square sure any symbol ahead 20 divided by d equals 5 c 4 okay is that right
4 alright do we have everybody who s copied this so we can move on more 20 plus use a symbol this time pentagon okay how many sides does a pentagon have
alright equals 32 pentagon 0 my gosh equals what
absolutely 12 okay 12 alright does that make sense
did alright variable once again that s a letter or symbol expression is that phrase that uses those numbers and operations but no equal sign expression what is that is that an expression no e . equation equation thank you
equation yeah okay because it has a what sign that s the difference shh that s the difference an equation has an equal sign and an expression does not but you can still solve an expression you just don t put the equal sign there
yes he s drawing comics okay stay with us alright stay with us now okay i need do we have our paper passer here no alright let s see let s see 0 that s right i m going to get somebody from doctor yes could you do n times n equals 28
280 well can you think of anything remember if you do that than n has to be the same number 0 but you could say n times n equals 25 thinking so 5 times 5 equals 25
sense yes anytime in an expression or an equation you use a letter it has to it has to represent that same number whatever number how do you know that because you couldn t say an n right now is a 5 but the other n is a 7 28 there you go that s it exactly and you know what that s algebra
algebra i thought all of this was algebra it is it is it is while alright can algebra . i think i have this on the overhead just a moment let me see see does algebra have to have like a symbol like not a number you don t have to have a symbol a symbol or a number i mean or a letter
okay alright we re just going to use we re just going to work off our paper
one jason has $25 his sister sarah always has 20 more than him how many 20 what more than him $20 more than him how much money does sarah have can we solve this easily alright write under that writing solve show me how you re going to solve that please write under that problem show me how you re going to solve it show and then of course you can always do your work off to the side if you need to
it i wonder how his sister always has more money than he has you ever wonder about those things older she gets paid $100 so she gets more money than you okay maybe she has a bigger allowance could be could be alright who has who can put this in a number sentence for me
who can put this in a number sentence have you got a number sentence shh shh shh shh what s a number sentence what do you have $65 okay that s the answer isn t it how do you get to there much $45 shh shh shh shh if your name is you have permission to speak $45 and then what am i going to add to that that sarah always has more than he does
$20 always has $20 more so in this particular case how much does sarah have $65 okay does everybody see that everybody see that question what happens if if jason gets more money sarah will always have $20 more than he has that s what it says
so now we ve got to come up with an expression remember that s a sentence without using an equal sign no cause it says she always has 20 wait what yep read it again she always has but what if she doesn t get money well we have to go with what information we re given she always has somehow i don t know how she works that out but that s a pretty good deal
this you said we had to do the expression are we ready part now let s try the same problem with an unknown okay now read that if his sister sarah has 20 more than him write an expression to show how much money sarah has okay now this gets a little tricky
no it doesn t some money now remember what we said about expressions and variables what numbers you can use symbols you can use letters so how can we show how much money jason has let s think because it s an unknown number
45 well that was the last question this is where it gets a little tricky but stay with me yes when we had number one it wouldn t let us it wouldn t really make sense this is i mean if we wouldn t have the thing up here does it really on the crct is it going to be like without how much it s says well let s not worry about the crct right now
this is we are learning about expressions okay so now we re we we don t know this time last time jason had $45 this time we don t know how much he has unknown and using the word variable that we learned
yes t +20 equals 6 ah this is hard do 0 wait a minute this is an expression do we have to have an equal sign no in fact let s take this equal sign off so we don t even get confused
seat just leave all that on the floor we ll get it later we ll get it later you re not gathering that are you you yes would you go throw whatever is in your shirt away and i need your focus on what work good go throw that out please alright now this is interesting everybody get your attention back here
it look at what came up with why did you use a d letter yeah well you know i thought that was interesting because what s this
smart she used a d now you can always use a lower case d $20 this is going to tell us an expression that shows every time how much the sister has sarah has she s always going to have $20 more than her brother now you could use his letter the letter of his name what is it j okay so j that stands for what
jason jason $20 and what s that going to give you has 65 but how do you know well here s here let me slow down a minute slow down shh this does not have to be $45 all the time
change because what happens if jason goes over to his grandmother s house and gets more money 20 okay so let s say we re going to let j equal what 20 he s got 20 but does he also have some money
need shh 225 okay 225 225 yep okay alright let s get let s get let s make sure we get everything done so we ll know alright okay so jason went to grandma s house he had his $45 and she gives him how much
20 20 so now this time we re going to let j equal how much more 65 $65 so now you can put this amount into into this into this expression and now we know what j is going to stand for this time so what would j equal how much money does sarah have
85 she will always have $20 more so what this can change that s why we call it a variable variable means change
yes so it would be j plus okay let s try to get back on track shh okay now what were you you were asking a question
i like it would be like j +20 equals another letter or something it could be it could be but that would be a that would be that would be an equation remember how we used to do we used to solve things kind of like this sentences kind of like this and then we would make a triangle out of it remember so we could say this time j we know is $65 plus how much does sarah always have more than he has
20 $20 and then we can just put the answer right under here instead of writing an equation and that still keeps it an expression this is just so we learn the difference between an expression and an equation alright so let me get your but in just a minute here okay say shh okay sweetie you re going to let s see what do you need for homework
nothing yes you need some kind of science can you backup just a little bit so he can get in there minute and then don t forget to go back to your mailbox and get just take all that paper out okay
alright now what happens if jason who has 60 doll $65 goes to the store and let s see he buys a game cost 60 if it s new let s say it s shall we say he s buying a new cop a new game call of duty black ops do we want to name do we want to name it
call of duty black ops alright so now listen how much money now see now we have to go back to our expression jason $20 is going to be how much 85 his sister has he had 65 he went to the store and now he spent how much left 5 5 so now what does the j equal
5 $5 wow we ll see you monday honorable will you go over all that all that information in your packet please for monday you alright 5 plus how much does his sister have more than he always has 20 20 so this time she went down a little bit too didn t she so now how much does she have
25 $25 alright now let s go on now we ve got the general idea now let s see how quickly we can go through this on huh okay listen you might have the same question
we shh go ahead quickly for this one if you didn t know what j equaled could you put j +20 equals another letter or something like that well you could but would it be an expression yes what would you do like how would you know what what it equals if you don t know what it equals you would have to always know how much money the problem was saying that jason had
so it would always have this 1st part not always that s hard well here s the trick to this and this is kind of this is kind of can we put that away
that sometimes they don t the problems do not call for a definite answer they just need to know do you know how to show how to get the answer and using an expression will help you do that that s why we re learning this because this is a good way it s kind of a problem solving that we use in our when we have word problems
it will be a big help if you can just write up an expression on how to solve the problem then go off an solve it
n ah denise has 3 times as many pencils as her friend karen if karen has 4 pencils how many dose denise have okay you want to try this one
think listen everybody put down what you think and then we ll see we ll let give her example see if it s right it you re thinking thinking again denise has 3 times as many pencils as her friend karen if karen has 4 pencils how many dose denise have
just write down what you think and write a number sentence to show how you would find it
expression good do you have yours do we put the answer you can put the answer underneath just like we did over here okay and that will be what are we calling this
expression expression good what do you have for that 3 okay 4 because that s how many pencils karen has times 3 because it says denise has 3 times as many remember
remember that back to multiplication and that s how you got the oops i almost put an equal sign 12 alright now we maybe don t know how many pencils karen has this time maybe she s got them in a bag in her desk and you you can t really see but here s what the here s what the question looks like when we don t we don t have a definite number
it denise has 3 times as many pencils as her friend karen write an expression to show how many pencil s denise has see use some thinking write down something remember if it s wrong you just cross it off it s not big deal right okay you ready
what you doing okay do you have an idea variable what could you we don t know something what don t we know that we don t . how many pencils karen has good
okay so now we ve got to come up with a letter or symbol to show how many she has what are you going to use for that pencil yeah that s a good idea let s do that one over here but let s listen to
d okay 3 times d now do we have an answer for this know we just know that whatever denise has how many pencils denise has we re going to multiply them time 3 and that s how many karen will have you can do that in your head well we don t know do we
but if we did let s say then that somewhere in the problem it says d equals 9 be 27 right so denise then would have 3 being here 3 times 9 would be 27 alright i kinda like this when you said the pencils stand for p does that make sense to you that p would be stand for pencil
and it says that denise has 3 times as many as her friend karen so p stands for the number of pencil s karen has no no this is your this is the correct answer to that problem how easy is that what if we put well what if p equals 12 know maybe one day she has 12 maybe one day she has 5
17 maybe okay all we re doing all we re doing is figuring out how would you solve this problem and expressions help us do that 3 cookies alright go ahead
24 cookies were shared between 6 friends how many cookies do they each get okay now this time think think think you got to divide duh shh shh shh shh shh shh let s think one 4 alright what is the expression you re going to use
by well this time we re just going to use the numbers 4 24 divided by 6 and that s 4 4 so each friend would get how many cookies in this case 4 alright now it says let s try the same problem with an unknown
a plate of cookies was shared between 6 friends write an expression to show how many cookies each friend received it hold on we re going to wait give everybody some thinking time okay okay remember this time use a variable
paper okay can you get another piece of paper for her and you ve got to stop walking around that i need you to sit down and get what you need and keep busy okay do we need to thank you
are shh i m still working on it answer huh alright c divided by 6 equals 4 okay c divided by 6 are we going to put an equal s sign
no cause this time it says this time it says a plate of cookies so that s the c stands for a plate we don t know how many cookies are on the plate alright do you give c divided by 6 do we have an answer for that no no no no because that is that 0 that s it that is a variable
sometimes a you know you know how sometimes you put cookies on a plate sometimes there might be 12 sometimes there might be 10 one what whoa well then you can t divide it between 6 friends can you not unless everybody gets 16th
cookie yeah alright let s turn over we ve got a few more and then i m going to see if you can finish the page on your own but let s do one more let s do one more number 4 number 4 shh number 4 okay who will read this
back there are 4 fewer blue marbles then red marbles in a bag there are 20 marbles how many marbles are in the bag okay what expression everybody write it out what expression will you use
listen again there are 4 fewer blue marbles than red marbles in a bag 4 fewer it s easy shh it then it goes on to say there are 10 red marbles
bag what expression are you going to use s b well we re not using we re actually using numbers this time on this part 4 well 6 yeah and it happens to be 6 blue marbles are there fewer or less blue marbles than red
yes okay now the same problem but using an unknown there are 4 fewer blue marbles than red marbles in a bag but this time it gives you some good information listen write an expression to show how many blue marbles are in the bag use r to represent red marbles okay let s put that rubber band away is that on your wrist for a reason
reason yes be okay r times wait r -6 equals 4
0 it says . this is a different problem problem read the 2nd part aloud please there are 4 fewer blue marbles than red marbles in the bag write the write an expression to show how many blue marbles there are in the bag use r to represent the red marbles okay we don t know how many how many red marbles there are we just know there are red marbles in a bag
be 6 6 less 6 4 less oops sorry 4 less that would be like whoops because it s always a what is it saying there are 4 fewer blue marbles always less
okay 4 less so that will tell us how many there are whatever number red you have you will have 4 less blue marbles 6 nope you have 2 more and you have 5 minutes i m going to walk around see if you re getting this on your own the 1st part you re going to show me a problem that ends up with an answer
the 2nd part for each one you re going to show me just an expression with no answer because it will be an unknown total amount okay it yes we are when we re done we re going to check over
2 yes ma am okay use it go over it and make sure you have the right amount can you take is this a 5 or no that s an s
we can draw a picture if needed especially when you re talking about the ribbon 0 i don t know how to do that it would probably be like a long rectangle you know like a ribbon would look okay i don t want to draw teacher
let me come around since i have 2 can i have 2 symbols for the one well the 1st one we re not really we re just kinda saying like the salad minus the sandwich okay because it asks how much more money does it cost to buy a salad
so it would be if you re writing an expression it would be $9.95 minus what the sandwich costs just like you wrote here except you re writing it vertically as a number sentence how much more money would it cost to buy a salad and salad does it say salads yes well that s if you go to the deli it says all their salads cost that much money
okay where is your number sentence for that or your expression sentence you drawing your ribbon
okay can you work these out or are you having trouble it okay then do it show us okay good well you re going to show us right good okay how are you doing good and what does your s stand for
sandwiches okay it says a salad costs this much sandwiches are less so when you re subtracting what number goes 1st
this that s right so if sandwiches are less than a salad . do you see minute i can t draw a ribbon that s okay you can t draw the ribbon that s okay alright listen number 5 who has an answer for that it says the 1st part
sarah s green ribbon is 5 inches shorter than her purple one if her purple ribbon is 11 inches long how long is her green one i m going to have to do something with oops i m going to have to do something with a picture on this okay here s my ribbon okay this is my purple one because it s the bigger one okay how big is does it say how big my purple ribbon is
yes the green one is shorter minute and it says the purple ribbon is 11 inches long okay so this is 11 and it says the green ribbon is 5 inches shorter than the purple
that okay alright so can you you can use pictures to help you always okay so now how would you write this as an expression
11 inches 11 inches what -6 inches and that will tell if you all will wait for just a moment please thanks inches now how let s just finish this one up and then we ll be done
okay everybody sit still pay attention okay and then soon as we finish this last part we ll be finished alright shh alright what it it says sarah s green ribbon is 5 inches shorter than her purple one use p to represent the length of her purple ribbon write an expression to represent the length of her green ribbon how would we write this
11 is the purple minus the green -6 if we don t if we know we know that the green is 5 inches shorter we don t know what the purple is what and it says to use p to represent the length of purple 6 good p minus okay hold on
5 i am so sorry i am probably just messing you all up so much it isn t even funny is it last time we thought that q was a . that s right okay sarah s green ribbon is 5 inches 0 we already figured it out that s why we put the 6 there
5 and then it ll give us whatever this is 15 alright do me a favor do me a favor shh do me a favor alright 1st of all who can tell me the difference between listen the difference between an expression and an equation
okay yeah
if you have your project to turn in go ahead what
give it a few minutes to make sure it s working this is observation 2 day one teacher fabulous 1052 and i ll just stick around for a few minutes all right thank you i want you to think back way way back to quarter one and we talked about in quarter one measures of central tendency
huh what mean 0
so i m going to give each of you this very large sheet of paper don t do anything with it until i give you directions
the constant talking over there at table 2 needs to stop why stop talking we re table 3
sorry 23 okay
gracious okay does everyone have a big giant sheet of paper
missus g is going to a big chart paper piece to model it
easier take your paper long ways so it s this way
take your 2 corners bring them together do not crease them pinch at the top and then pinch at the bottom and then open up
you re going to fold each edge over to your pinch line and crease it so that it ends up looking like this
if you don t know what to do raise your hand and i will help you we need you just did this with your sound book stations b i don t know if it was yeah it was yesterday wasn t it
okay this looks similar to yours
it was work it was working but okay
wait while your working try and cut your flaps
it what i would like you to do is i would like you to cut around the rectangle
which rectangle i ll show you
if you look up here from where it says main you cut straight down to the bottom of the paper top to bottom and then under where it says days across you should be able to get a nice rectangle out of this
no if you cut look from the edge down name 0 okay like this 0 that side you mean right here do you see
are you scissor less yes
off my scissor under your foot incredibly rude
you re going to glue this inside of your flappy so you re going to glue it in the middle just like this
flaps is this like in the flap area of your foldable you re going to glue it down this please stop talking
down there s a lot of talking and not a lot of gluing going on
okay i don t care what order you do this in please put the lid on your glue and close your flaps
we need to write the following terms on the outside of each flap mean median mode range
and don t write it so teeny weeny that nobody will be able to see it hand ms
g can i write in text like m 3 n texting we do not write in text
okay does everybody have this
yeah let s see real quick right now before we move any further flip your foldable over write your name either at the top or the bottom of the paper
middle cause we need the middle top or bottom not in the middle cause we re going to be using the middle
artistic honey can you look at your spelling of range and my spelling of range please okay
who remembers 0 let s start with median who can tell me what median is
it s the middle number when it s in what order or correct as long as it s in numerical order it doesn t matter
i need a quiet thumbs up when you have that right done now do we have to write median and all of that thing no baby cause you already have that i didn t have that because i can t physically open and close the flaps on the that would be cool if i could do that wouldn t it
cool promethean boards which are a different type of board can do that we should get one promethean they cost like a fortune this is not even a year old do you think they re going to by me a new one
okay so open up your flappy look at your data set look at your graph you have all this room around your graph when you glued it down
0 i want you to put your numbers in number order
you have room at the top on the side or on the bottom and i want you to find that median temperature for the data set you have
temperature have you put them in number order cause i know i don t see it written down anywhere on your paper
somebody what s our median 70 70 degrees okay right in the middle 70 degrees it s the middle number
i hear lot if you have room you can write the median on your flap you can write the median of this data set is 70 degrees but baby this is your median flap so what i need you to do is change the other is change the outside
right i m leaving the mean until last do you mind 1st okay i just heard somebody say mode is the easiest who said that
easiest cause you just got to find the most of whatever number so mode on the outside of your mode flap write easy as cake
can we write pie nope aww let me see if i understand you correctly you said you had to find the most no the most of the same number of the same yes multiple of the same number most of the same number so how can we write that in fancy schmancy math terms

so what is our mode in our data set miss e
70 is it possible and you know me i m always curious about things is it possible for a set of data to not have a mode
no okay okay yes how many of you agree with that it is possible to have a data set that has no mode do we have an i don t know choice no
choice how many of you say there has to be a mode no matter what mind okay can i ask you why you say yes it s possible to have a data set with no mode
because you can have one one you can have 2 one 2 you can have one number in the data set and you won t have a exactly
cause if we look up here at our number line we can call that a data set granted i would not want to find the mean or the median of that data set because it goes from a 100th to at this one in 5 hundredths i don t want to find the median
themselves can a number excuse me not a number a data set have more than one mode speaking yeah yes yes it can
how many of you say huh how many of you say not sure not sure if we can have more than one mode earlier did it just go to sleep or did it lose the green button so it didn t i don t know but i m videotaping right now okay i don t the black light came on
light how many of you say nope no way can t have more than one mode ever ever ever in a 1000000 years
quiet data set
write it down on a sheet of paper 80 okay 50 100 80 100 100 it i know what the mode is
i wrote off an extra number now you say it s a 100 yes too no other number
no just 100
give me 5 give me 5 and you re on your own team yes no i want to be on my own team i call 20
okay raise your hand if you re on team and and you say that the mode is 80 and 100 quiet please
18 put your hand up now i ll wait
in so 4 of you 3 of you cause we ve got one absent should be on team and say that the mode the median excuse me the mode is only 80
somebody doesn t have a clue this data set is said to be bi modal mean 2
modes it has 80 and 100 because they both show up the same number of times back home on the range you said home on the range home home on the range where the deer and the antelope play
the numbers very good
number or numbers number or numbers range what is range
range how you add it all together nope i know it i the maximum okay so how do we use math words maximum minus minimum us you subtract the lowest number from the highest number why
you cannot do that the highest number from the lowest number the highest number from the lowest number
that the highest what is range the highest number but why wait i ll wait for you why because why is range the highest number minus the lowest number
divided by 2 no it s not divided by 2 there s no division us what are we finding out when we find the range range what are we finding out
c the how many numbers are between the lowest and the highest right we re looking at this okay right yes okay it s the ncaa tournament listen i have a question no that s world cup
cup when you watch espn boys and some girls you get out of that chair again and fall out of it on purpose you ll be out of the room
you and they talk about the point spread they re talking about the difference between the high the winning team and the losing team
the winning team let s say ohio state is playing duke okay ohio state gets 106 points that s a lot of points game so ohio state 106
night duke had a really bad night and their lead point scorer pulled a hamstring where is duke north carolina and their no one defender he fouled out 1st quarter okay how do you get fouled out 1st quarter 0 well he s very aggressive he s their no
yeah he fouled out 1st quarter rest so duke had a bad night
duke only scored 72 points i quit they did not throw in the towel the range for this game is how many points
34 34 points the spread it spreads out over 34 points on the number line range how far along the number line is the data spread
15 so range is 15 so if we plotted our numbers on a number line how many steps is it from our bottom number to our high number 15 do you need me to move this up
cause i can t it won t let me take the whole thing there we go way beautiful that s beautiful is it an emergency go ahead
yes it is
what is another name for mean
no for mathematical mean t ah you didn t listen to the question i m going to ask you the question again and then you can answer it
what is another term or name for mean we talk about it when progress reports come out and when report cards come out
okay thank you for stepping on everyone else s learning another name for mean is average when we talk about your averages we re taking the mean of your grades total it s the sum total with something done to it
what do you do after you find the sum total by nope i got it
here add all data points divide some by what
how many numbers there are numbers in that line the number that s in the line no how many numbers are there how many numbers are on the data how can write that so it s not confusing cause if i write divide the sum by the number of numbers that just sounds weird well it sounds weird but it s also really funky sounding and feeling
how can we write divide the sum by what do we write what do we put in here ooh the total of
i by the number in the data chart now that s just real long what do you think
data set no that s the whole thing chart a data what chart how about data number data set divide by the number of data total numbers data what points points in the data
look at your graph up do we need a what s we need a what no let s find the mean of our graph we have 60 degrees what s 2 sunday was 60
65 what s tuesday 60 75 friday 70 70 okay stop
question where is our mean going to fall what number group do you think our mean is going to be in 80s i don t know no it why are you looking at me like i m crazy when i ask if it s going to be in the 80s
stop stop why cause it s going to be more than that it s going to be more than 80 yes it s going to be are you talking about the mean yeah i m talking about the average the mean 0 is the mean going to be in the 80s
80s cause no number in that order is the no number in the set is about 80 not do i have more 60s or more 70s
70s so where do you think is it going to be closer to 60 or 70 70 it s going to be closer to 60 right so we ve got 5 10 regroup one 2 3 4 28 +18 19 7 47
it yes i got that 470
7 cause there s 7 numbers i heard somebody say divide it by 2 put the lid on your glue please
4766 what s 6 times 7
67 it s 67 and we can write it as a fraction it s not 67 one .01 it s not .01
61 and 17th or you can ignore the remainder in this case and say it s about 67 can t you put the decimal you can and you can add zeros forever and it s never going to come out even okay so we re going to round it to the nearest whole number and that would be 67
okay today why central tendency things why is it important to be able to understand these things b okay
number you re going to want to know exactly how much money you have in your bank account aren t you you re not going to want to find an average are you no because if you average your money and you go to the grocery store and you re below the average you re check they re going to say i m sorry
we can t take your check today and then you re going to turn purple and be really embarrassed and have to walk away like this that why mean median mode and range think we re going to have to no matter what we re looking at we re going to have to use those process later on in life
yes we are going to have to use those processes later on in life especially well yeah but you know i ve gotten lazy because i now have a computer that will average my grades for me when i 1st started 20 years ago i sat there with an adding machine one and i would how old were you 20 years ago how old i was 23
i want to see a picture of you me too i look exactly like i do now without the gray hair wow you got gray hair i don t see it but i used to have to enter grades by hand into a calculator and then count them all up divide them by however many and then was it easy well i learned how to keyboard without looking at it
it but friday we re going to play with somebody s grades class no one in this class i m going to pull i m going to go online and pull my sons grade report
them i m going to take their names off of it and we re going to go through all of the data points and we re going to see what we d rather have for a grade all 100s would we rather have once it shows up would you rather have the mode could be
would you rather have would you want to have the range as your grade no yes no
no a 90 no so good point no what if you had a 100 and 0 what s what the range
a 100 a 100 your highest number minus your lowest number is 100 -0 is division 0
mean god gave you 2 of these and one of these so you can listen twice as much as you run your mouth for some reason you seem to think you have 2 mouths and one ear cause you talk way more than you listen okay so would we want to use range as a grade
no all right i have an activity that i want you all to do and i need help deciding where i should do my grocery shopping ooh i know where you should go wal mart wal mart stop i don t need your input at the moment
0 so why are your drawing on your desk i m why are you doing that
so i m going to give everybody a sheet and i want you to put your name on it and today s date and then we ll talk about it are those receipts you have no they re ms
g s actually cause i don t do the grocery shopping in my house g does and we shop at sam s club usually yes sir pardon me
one of these here why is there so much conversation going on
what did you do to my brand new pencil all right why are you talking like yoda all right take a look real quickly i m waiting i ll wait can i go the bathroom not right now i m waiting still
waiting i want you to take your pencil right now and i want you to look at the receipts wherever you see a minus draw a line through it
for example the 2nd line on the harris teeter one says ¢49 minus draw a line through that so you don t use it .49 get rid of the ¢39 off go down to the food lion receipt
those are big savings don t worry about it where it says mvp discount -79 there s 2 of them them you have 2 receipts do we do the mvp price too you are only yeah get rid of the $2.50
here you are only dealing with the numbers all the way over to the right hand side of your receipts this is the deal
you need to find the mode mean median range for both sets you re not doing them both together you re doing them separately what are these the real those are real receipts ms
g took them out of her purse yesterday and took them to the copy machine and made copies
now after you ve done mean median mode and range you need to decide based on mean median mode and range where i should go shopping
questions you can get a calculator freeze i didn t say you could get 11 but i do need you to write everything down too i will pass guess what
one i will pass out calculators dear i don t have my calculator where did i put your calculator yes yep
that you need to ask one of your neighbors maybe they can help you out
you you may go to the bathroom thank you hey you want to go next door just sit down and beg ms b for 4 calculators for me
just say please we need 4 calculators can we borrow 4 please please please what may pardon me so what do you do when you have an even number what do you think you should do when you have an even number of data pieces
0 now i know why i did that what do you think you need oops ow that was my foot sorry yeah go ahead what do you think you need to do if you have an even number of data points
back yes baby what do you need
may i have a piece of paper okay shh shh you can write on the back or you can get a sheet of notebook paper
okay how d you get that okay you tell me what do you think you re going to do if you have an even number what are you going to do
you need to find out what s here so how am i going to do that you re going to add the the middle number and then i m going to do what divide by right can you tell him again down from this one
no finding range not for median no you don t subtract 2 okay when you have listen listen what does the median mean
m add the 2 middle numbers and you divide by 2
add them together a plus b equals question mark and then you take your question mark and then you take your question mark and you divide it by 2
c yes madam as i m kicking and walking into chairs and hurting me yes madam is the calculator supposed to have an endless sign magic magic can you sit down please round them to the nearest penny
set it down i what does it mean for i think i did it wrong with the decimal what is this so what is this number that you found okay
how did you have this number when you re adding you know what you have hundredths so you ve entered something are you listening to me you ve entered something in wrong so you need to go back you no
pencil you know me i m a big pencil thief
again didn t know that was there are you okay stab you through the heart are you a vampire no i have no idea where that mcdonald s came from
2 it s yours me i m walking around and i m seeing a whole lotta children talking and not a whole lotta work being done
ms g are we supposed to do the range yes you have to do the range my answer is wrong for this one if i have to round them no ms g my calculator won t work for me work are you sure it s the calculator that doesn t work and not the child
yeah i have a question what are you asking or radius and radius there s a radius what one are you on
harris teeter but what are you finding the range no you re going to put in 90 whatever your highest number is which is what
$14.99 $14.99 minus .95 work it s so easy to follow can you label what you have here
what you mean i think you re missing something or you ve added funky did you just say you were done with harris teeter eah and i didn t even use the calculator you re mean can t be that high i got i forgot to divide wait a minute wait a minute stop
stop put your hands on your head please okay when you re working with your mean please make sure that you look don t just write your answer down that you look to see if your answer is reasonable
if you i ve walked around and i ve seen a couple people with means in the 40s or the 50s no why not cause the ah they didn t divide
so make sure that when you re doing you can put your hands down now when you re doing a mean you divide but we ve got to stop cause it s lunch time yea 0 yes
that all right good morning boys and girls
does anybody know what numerical value is attached to a 10 by 10 grid if a grid has a dimension of 10 by 10 what is the numerical value inside of the grid
number so then what number value does a 10 by 10 grid have yes a 100 all right so let us start with this word problem mister chewit has to decide which of the 4th graders are going to the zoo
he decides that since they are a 104th graders he would choose the best 15th of the kids with the highest mcas scores how many are going to the zoo all right we have talked about word problems and the 1st question we always ask ourselves is what is the operation
does anybody have any idea or strategy of how we could solve this word problem us 2 seconds us come on guys
us how many are going to the zoo right is there anymore information that we know from this word problem know
that there are 104th graders that there are 104th graders we try to figure out the operation that is right now
here the 15th of the kids with the highest mcas scores
know i am going to show you this grid represents what do you think that grid represents 104th graders 104th graders
the grid is dimensions are 10 by 10 100 how are we going to figure out using the grid who are the top 4th graders in the school in the mcas anyway how are we going to use the grid to figure that out
well it says to divide fifths so why does it say to divide it by fifths where does it say that that it says he will choose 15th of the kids so
so basically you said you will divide the denominator denominator very good said basically use this is 15th
and when you are trying to find 15th of a whole the 1010 the den nominator is very important because the den nominator is going to tell you how many groups by how many groups you should be dividing by
well how many groups do i need to split this 100 into according to this word problem f how many groups should i be splits this grid into according to the word problem groups so i need to do this 5 equal groups
pencils on desk you can get some on my desk all right i am going to give brown brown he is one group right
green here is yellow now that i have started anybody want to tell me how many more each of them can get
red here is purple 123455 different groups look can anybody figure out how many each group can get
have 20 you think they could each get one more row yeah anybody else agree with or disagree with
have this is brown again again this is yellow again red red
f 20 they each got 20 squares 15th of 100 is 2020 how many kids are going to the zoo
g 2020 students are going to the zoo you could solve it today boys and girls by using your grids and coloring them numerically right because we have talked about this before right 15th of a 100 you divide the bottom and multiply the top
okay i want you to try this visually at least 2 times paper you are going to try the visual way at least twice okay how much before i let you go is 3 fifths if mister
chewit says only 15th can go but then he decides you know what we got extra money from a generous donor now we can have 3 fifths of the 4th graders go go 60 raise your hand many 3 fifths 0
if 15th is 20 how much is 3 fifths 6060 very good do you see how you can use the benchmark to help you with the higher fraction on that track right so each student is going to receive a 10 by 10 square grid
okay and i have listed 12 fractions on there that you are going to identify either by the visual method or the numerical method twice and this way the majority of the time 2 tenths 14th and 15th
each person is going to get 410 by 10 grids great are there any questions before i let you go back and do some group work yes do you have to write and color in your own grid square yes nobody is doing one grid square for the whole group
each person is going to individually do their own grid square right okay
please that way and here you go
out you have one
you have one good 0 miss
look i made you some bigger ones
so you are going to tell me you are going to show me what is one tenths on the 10 by 10 grid you are going to show me what is 3 tenths on a 10 by 10 grid or you are going to tell me how many grid pieces with 4 tenths look like
okay are there any other questions yes how much time can we use this you can use 4 and i have a lot more extra back there
okay anybody else have questions right that does not fit all right you guys i need to give you i don t know how this happened i am having an extra one
take off your coat and your hat and your gloves take it all off off inaudible it is not cold in here
2 tenths wait is it possible you can do it just by yes you can do it many as use your brain buddy you can do it out 0 so it is in fourths yeah
remember i have more than enough extra grids very good try to figure out how many squares go into 14th
one no try to how many squares do you color in for 14th i like to see people checking fractions off once they have found them
circles out
0 all right so which one are you guys on now
14th we are using these grids on your own
now you are going to try to find these fractional values on these grids 10th do you remember what this is called in the fraction in a fraction what is that called
the number that is below the bottom the denominator the denominator right so the denominator tells us how many groups we are going to break something into right groups meaning you have to have 10 equal pieces right so what does 2 tenths look like if that is 110th
color i have asked you once do you take twentieths how many groups does it has to be
groups maybe this one was 10 twentieths maybe with this one you try to the numerical value 1st 0 so you divide it by what what do you divide it by
remember set it up here and see if you remember that do you remember i do not remember i want to find out what is 3 fourths of 24
that one is it 3 or 3 fourths of 2403 fourths good now do 14th or 15th which ever one you want to do good so then that is how you figure 3 fourths of 24
how do you think you are going to figure out is that the same thing as you try to figure out 10 twentieths a 1000 do you remember what to do yeah so how many groups are you going to break it up if you do
which one you doing 14th 15th 14th so how many groups are you going to break it up into 4 okay i am leaving yep how am i supposed to do this which one are you doing 110th but how when i finished 110th i go to the next one yeah
you do you need to go to the next one for 2 tenths you could or you could just color in 2 of these and then that is 2 tenths right inaudible okay who you going to get is that wrong no that is 14th is that divide it by 4 you have to divide it by 4
okay kind of how many squares did you color good what are you doing
wait a minute this is a good example if you keep these groups at this size will you be able to make 4 equal groups and that is it like there are 4 members in this group right
and if i did this 4 times 1234 i have only colored in 20% of the square 14th means that you have to cut this square into 4 equal groups 0 so that is not 14th i have to color it in yes you can have it because i did my thing
right thank you
all right you are on 15th show me 110th color in 110th
show me 2 tenths good so then label it 110th and color in 2 tenths and label it 2 tenths 0 so why did you do all of them as one fourths you only have to show me 14th on 110 by 10 grid
paper i do not get the 15th 15th the same thing as 2 tenths you want me to show you how 2 tenths is the same as 15th yes you see it
look 2 over 10 right is not simplified meaning it is not down to it is most simplest form because i can divide 2 into 10
5 i can not divide one into 5 and get a number but i can divide 2 into 10 and because i can divide 2 into 10 divide by 2 divide by 2 and i get one over 50
more 6 over 8 is not at its simplest form because i can divide a number both into 6 and both into 8 which is 22 what you do to a top of a fraction you have to also do to the bottom you can not divide this one by 3 and then this one by 4 no
so divide by 2 you have got 3 over 44 is there a number that can divide into those 2 numbers
form that is what is talking about when he says 015th of the same is 2 tenths if you were to divide that group into 10 equal pieces and you only colored in 2 of them you know your picture would look the same as 15th
it i brought these to start these 2 over too which one do not you get do you know how to do this okay
b well how many groups do you have to divide this square into groups so each group has to have the same amount
5 right so let us start it over i have 50 you did groups what i did was i said okay i am going to assign each group a color then
group and then this is the do i have to color that one now this is a turquoise i am talking to another group understand until i filled it all in i have to keep track of my groups group and then here is the maroon group all right
5 so now i need to go back and see can i give them more because i have not used up all of it do i use up this whole thing figure out how many more you can give each group 12020 that is how you find it like this yep is that right flip them over because there are 2 sides
so have you done 2 tenths yet
here i need to say it on here 2 tenths good
so then let us try 3 tenths 3 tenths good are you going to do it all numerically it is fine with me honey just do them good
so this is 14th how many groups do you have to break this grid into
good good job
square does it look like very good in that is why 2 fourths is the same as one half very good so i color just one half you could write 2 fourths equals one half
115th how many groups do you have to break this square into thinking remember miss heard said maybe i should try 5 different colors and break it up this is the same thing it is just different very good so what do you say then about 2 fifths and 110th they are they are the same they are equivalent
remember we talked about some fractions equal each other do you understand all right i want you to do them numerically because this might mess you up do so go ahead good you did 2 tenths you did 110th now do 14th how many groups do you need to break something up to 14th
huh 15th is the same as you telling that there are 20 squares it is just which one is it just like
good 5 more minutes can i see your spiral book please sure
22 all right finish up that last fraction that last grid to share out
please so it is report card time it was a couple years ago when i was teaching fractions and a student came up to me and he said missus heard i just need you to count only 2 tenths of my grades okay because you only count 2 tenths of my grades and i will get a better grade
but if you get all of the 10 tenths of my grade i will not get a better grade so i said to him well you know what that sounds fair to me i will only look at but i will not look at 2 tenths of your grade i will look at 15th i will look at 15th of your grade and he got upset and he said no
heard only 2 tenths and i said you know you are going to get a one because you did not get it what am i trying to say h that 2 tenths is the same as 15th exactly look at your 2 tenths and your 15th visual pictures
it is the same i am sorry 2 tenths and 2 tenths and 15th are the same right yep 2 tenths is 20 cubes and 15th is 20 cubes
ago i might have to find a new place for it because nobody is looking at it and trying to memorize it because the information on it very important the information is equivalent fractions that we have found so far
and i think children have our confused as to why it is important to find and know your equivalent fractions your equivalent fractions are important to know because sometimes when you have to find a half or 2 fourths of 300 the question might ask you what is 2 fourths of 300 and you might get stumped
but if you know 2 fourths is the same as one half then you just cut 300 in half 300 what is half of 300 150 are there anymore equivalent fractions that we learned today that can go onto this board are there anymore equivalent fractions that we learned today that can go on this board
j 15th equals 2 tenths 15th equals 2 tenths are there anymore b 15th equals 2 fifths 15th and 25th are the same thing
thing 2 fourths equals one half is that up here else yes would 2 fourths equal one half we have 2 fourths equals one half there is no more
110 twentieths 10 twentieths 10 twentieths is the same as one half as one half okay
one half look at the numbers look at the numbers d because 2 has a 20 before the 0 and one has before the 0 you mean this reason because 10 is half of 20 that is right because 10 is half of 20
and remember i told you that all of the halves the numerator is always half of the denominator yes here is another 12 fourths is the same as one half we have that have one half is the as 2 fourths right up there see
i have i want you to turn and tell somebody what you learned in math today
alright we re going over lattice multiplication and before we go over lattice multiplication we re going to warm up with just our multiplication facts so just like yesterday i m going to start off with the 2s and 3s then i m going to ask somebody to do 46789 you ready
yes alright 2s ready set go multiple students 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 alright 2 4 6 83s now i think had a beat
go multiple students 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 good volunteer to do 4s
4s so when you warm us up you re actually going to be doing what i did right watching people 1st alright who wants to step up
go ready set go multiple students 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
60 alright stop there i want to see one person can do that so we know what our 6s are see and if she s right thumbs up if she s wrong thumbs down go 6 12 18 24 30 32 36 42 48 54 60
close you had 32 in there you want to try it again one more time her step up alright go ahead 6 12 18 24 30 32 36 40 32 36 48 54 60 32 is there anybody in here who can say it perfectly without so listen to them so you know the rhythm of it
don t throw that number in there that s off go ahead 32 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
go multiple students 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 alright 7s i need a volunteer for 7s me me
me please i can t reach go ahead 0 we ll get there 123 eyes on you alright go ahead
go 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 72 don t say it listen now alright stop there if i point to you that means stop and just listen cause you re messing it up so i d rather you listen to it 1st cause you were making some 8s in there
me who i haven t heard you re ready now it when you re ready all eyes on
do i have to it by myself no you start us off 0 ready set and go 80 alright 9s that s the last one
k she wouldn t let me go no no no no that alright when you re ready start us off go ready set go
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
good stop there the 6s 7s 8s and 9s all it s going to take is a little bit more practice especially once you get closer to the 12s times tables on if you can hear me clap once you can hear me clap twice 3 times
alright so we warmed up with multiplication but i want to know who can tell me now all on their own what would i need multiplication for in real life what would i need multiplication for outside of just this classroom don t tell me homework studying thank you don t tell me homework test why do you need to know it now so that you can use it in the real world
d you need multiplication because but skip me together you all do things all the time with multiplication every day
a what you need to you need to know multiplication because if you go out in the real world and then you try to get a job and fill out the application and then got to do something with counting and money and then you got to tell how much money you were going to make to the home and if you would make at home alright well how would skip counting help you though how would that s very good though but what does skip counting do for me
what does multiplication do easier for me help me do easier without doing one 2 3 4 5 6 you already said that you can do 2 4 6 8
d right if you want to be a scientist 1st and we have be a scientist you will say x +9 it would be x plus v times j okay times you either have to look fast or okay so you need to know it if you want to be a scientist and have to learn how to solve these big equations
one like if have kids and you re thinking about groceries hold on listen like if you had kids and you have groceries for them and it s $120 you need to know like how many ones or 10s or 5s exactly if i ve got $5 bills or i ve got $10 bills and i have to figure out how much it s going to take me to get to $120
why talk about money all the time you know money is very important one you said science and she said a job application who cares who cares so you can be if she was respectful of your answer you can be respectful of her you now i m going to show you how to multiply or we re going to learn today how to multiply larger numbers
on the sheet of paper for your title i want you to write lattice don t sit on or rock on the back of the chair if that s what you did
that s fine alright what s your question brand new sheet of paper brand new sheet of paper draw a box just like this like you see in geometry square that s fine it doesn t have to be too big
you know the 1st thing you have to do is draw your box correctly so after you draw your box the number that you are going to multiplying which is 346 times 23 you are going to place correctly on your box
1st number 346 goes at the top just like this
2nd number 23 goes vertical down the side right hand side of your box
then to draw the miniature boxes inside of your lines you look at the number and draw a line right in between 3 and 4 and you draw a line right in between 4 and 6 you look horizontal and your numbers on the right hand side of 23 you draw a line in between 2 and 3
that s how you know how to draw your boxes and how many you need in each column and each row now you have to draw diagonals corner to corner you re going to draw a diagonal in each box each of your small boxes corner to corner and after you do that extend your diagonal out just a little bit further cause this is where your answer s going to go
like this this is a lattice box good and so now we re going to do lattice multiplication next step is you have to multiply your columns by your rows
so if i want to know what my answer is for this box i look at the number straight on top of my column which is 6 and the numbers straight across hm so i put my 10s here and my ones here any number in the 10 s place goes there any number in the one s place goes here 12
if i want to know what goes in this box i have 6 straight on top of my column and 3 across 6 times 3 is multiple students 18 exactly who could tell me what 2 numbers have to multiply to get this box 2 how did you know because the lattice is like like 2 is a constant pulling down very good
2 is across in this row and 4 is up at the top 8 right those 2 4 on top 3 across 4 times 3 is 12 12 see why you need to know your skip counting cause you know right off you just know it right off the top of your head in this box straight on top is a 3 straight across is a 2
6 since there s no 10s you put a 0 in place of the 10s here are you coming back to the 3 and the 4
8 now you need to add your diagonals 8 there is nothing but the number 8 in this diagonal we re only dealing with the numbers in the box
outside 8 is by itself so you just take 8 and put it right outside see this diagonal has 2 one and 2 if i add this 2 +one is 3 +2 is 5 and i put my 5 right here in this diagonal see
this diagonal has one 8 one and 9 in it 9 9 +one is 10 10 +9 is 19
regroup so i put my 9 here and my one goes in the next diagonal so now in this diagonal i have my one which i took from regrouping here people whether she was talking or not i don t like that language and i don t want to hear it again
you i think you should apologize sorry okay now let s see if you can do better next time you could say excuse me could you be quiet better one which i got from my 19
7 hey 0 0 cause there s nothing there nothing there so you could put 0 out here just so you remember if you re adding and putting the numbers on the outside yes and finally starting from left to right i will write my entire number 0 7 9 5 8
7958 whenever 0 is in front of a number we don t need it and you have to remember to put your comma in the correct spot
7958 i had that you got to put them in the right line when you write them good make sure you line them up alright now i showed you
i m going to erase the whole thing and i want you to be able to draw your lattice box and i want you to be able to solve and i m going to come around so in this part it s not about what s right or wrong it s just about me checking and helping seeing if you understand it you re going to give us some help yeah i m going to give you a brand new problem so you can draw a line underneath that problem and get ready to do this one on your own
out and please don t speak to people improperly can i do it over 2 papers i m going to give you a brand new one
32 you want to do to understand how we do this hm 32 if you have any questions raise your hand help bring this down some more cause you re going to confuse this with the 1st one
smoking write your number 1st 1st and then you put your lines in between the numbers
421 no don t write the line 1st it s confusing when i write the numbers there okay do you know i raised my hand 0
i ll get them answers alright one times 3
it put a 0 3 in this box put the times sign and i ll always remember to do times what goes here 2 the number straight across is what number 3 6 number straight on top is
number 0 you re right on top on top
12 so that s it
12 alright now see if you can do that bottom 2 more minutes okay yet i see some
i see okay it s 4 times 2
can t yell out
i ll wait about 45 more seconds for everybody hand down check then with the next problems i give you on your own i ll let some people come up
i m putting the line in between 4 and 2 are you watching while i do it check and make sure that s what you ve done space and somebody said you can always put this here to help you remember it s multiplying 1st
so i have to draw my lattice box and i have to put my lines in between the numbers right diagonals corner to corner corner to corner just remember that and then a little bit out when you re done it s always good to know your skip counting straight on top is one
3 one times 3 is 0 i mean 3 2 0 2 cause one is on top and 2 is across can somebody tell me what goes here k 0 wait 0 6
a alright 2 times 2 is 4 12 4 is on top 3 is across know cause 4 times 4 is 4 times 2 you looked on top and you looked across to get that
and with skip counting so i multiplied now i have to add my diagonals to get my answer 2 what about this diagonal can you add that up for me and tell me what answer it would be if i add up this diagonal teacher he got a 9
think look at all look at me look at all the numbers in this diagonal what numbers are there 7 7 cause 3 +0 is 3 +4 is 7 how about this diagonal that diagonal is 14 put the one on the 0
okay so you regrouped 0 +6 is 6 +0 is 6 +8 is 14 4 goes here regroup my 10s goes up here in the next column next diagonal what about this diagonal i hear talking and i shouldn t 3 one +0 is one +2 is 3 +0 is 3 t no
that s not how you respond laughing at people what d you say one one because there s only one in the diagonal right one in the diagonal so i take my number going from left to right 1000 13472 good i was like going to say 13
14 on your next sheet of paper i m going to give you 2 problems yay yay this time no clean sheet
sheet clean yeah pull the same sheet out now this time without my help at all see if you can think about the steps i still wrote them up here as a clue for you
papers no same 11st one 525 times 362nd one is 78 times 29
hey i messed up there okay go to another one
that was my mistake easy
i m not going to say anything i m going to come up to you just to see about your answer alright i want you to trust yourself to go through all the steps until you get to the answer
one alright 2 more minutes next one go all the way through 1st and then i ll tell you if the answer is right trust yourself
i don t trust my answer the only clues you have are those steps on the board
answer did you add the diagonals you got to add the diagonals you re missing a step up there alright here
here s your challenge this challenge is yeah on this challenge i m getting into some even larger numbers
it check the next one
minute alright hold off on the challenge cause i m going to wait for everybody to do it and then i m going to show you guys something else we already know how to do it
end you re not finished yet 45 more seconds no
alright add your diagonals 0 plus what is what outside add this 5 +3 +2
you sure 2 check it again 5 +3 +2 30 seconds okay
what did i say about that and also if you were laughing or saying something that wasn t nice either but it really wasn t nice to say those mean words you can express yourself better than that i d appreciate it if you d be quiet please
that s what you could have said to him
can you say i apologize for that huh i m going to say you could just put names up there alright let me have that s all i m going to give you number one
number 2 alright keep going see but as long as you know your skip counting well what you re going to do now is check it to see if what you wrote matched theirs okay and after that we re going to see how we can put this together with problem solving
hm got take your paper take your paper
you already had it right what to add
we ll wait to add them they re almost done what you re doing now is you can check and make sure that yours matches theirs
alright see if you actually did the same thing
5 +3 +60 write exactly what you have on your paper hm you just carry a one
one +one +6 so that s an 8
60
everybody check s no alright take your seat
one you should have had 15 here 5 times 3 is 15 6 2 times 6 is 12
5 times 3 is 15 18900 yes good alright 8 times 2 is 16
72 7 times 2 is 14 63 alright so you got to make sure your skip counting is right
63 2 6 +7 is 11 13 13 13 +3 one one +one is 4 +4 is 6
2262 alright you said it backwards it looks backwards now the last thing is although we know how to do multiplication using lattice box usually what you ll see is a word problem
and sometimes when you read your word problem you end up getting confused
you ve seen my masking tape i just want to show you what a word problem would be looking like
right cupcakes 0 like some and baking and some of that cake alright we ll put one tape alright most people know trey songz right yes whether you like them how many people like them how many people said no
alright it is problems you got to use multiplication in real life and real life people use it
birthday if he has 55 tables to fill and each table has 105 cupcakes how many cupcakes must he order in all you already know the answer or you know what you need to do know because what s your key word
if i put if you saying how many it does say how many in all if i know how many means to multiply and what else is your key word see who else knows the key multiplication word
d when you say in all in all is one of them but you got to have this other word with in all so that you know k how many could you no cupcakes no all it starts with an e each thank you
each alright each each so if i have my number 55 and how many cupcakes times 105
105 and how much they re you can work it out on your paper work it out there alright i can do i m going to do that even real life people have to use it
line it up evenly and show me what you get go ahead and work it out need how you going to figure that out
0 okay
and we re on air and we are on air have this is what we re going to be talking about a little bit today we re going to do some multiplication review and we re going to do decimals on the number line okay
so write that down in your 3 ring binder please do we have to do multiplication yeah multiplication review you can move your head a little bit just move your head
just move your chair a little bit okay yes i can t hear you okay i ll get you another one
there you go
it okay show it to the camera and then you have to go back to work very good okay now sit down and we ll get back on it f yeah
yeah can you give okay so what i m going to do right now is we re going to review a little bit of math math when i call on you because of the filming you have to kind of speak up a little bit so the microphone can hear you so don t be afraid to speak up a little bit
here do we have to write the smaller number line it says to do the multiplication decimal and number line okay on the number line yes the decimals on the number line yeah we did
okay we good i got to turn this off do we have to okay okay so here s the problem
okay and let s see if we can solve this using mental math so i want to put 21 times 421 times 4 wait for one minute okay
this i took the 11st that says 4 then i put the 2 over the 4 and 8 so did you line it up this yeah okay so you went 21 times 4 is 4 then you did what
i did i did 44 times 2 is that 20 that s a 20 so . so by doing this you did really 20 times 4 equals 80 differently how did you solve it i did . i did 21 times 2
0 21 times 2 and what did you get when you did 21 times 2 42 then you did 42 +42 equals 84
42 from . i had to grab a 2 from the 4 yep differently come here the traditional way okay you did the traditional way so you went 21 times 4 so what do we have
that 4 times one equals 4 yeah then 4 times 2 equals and 4 times 2 equals 8 but again is that really a 2 or is that a 20 it s a 20 and it s just because of where it lines up
one okay so if we have . 15 times 2515 times 25
pencil how would you solve that if you just did it in your head a little bit more difficult than the 1st one right okay so what do we get for an answer did anybody get it
202000 what did you get for an answer 450 okay why don t we solve it head i would do without 5 times 525 times 5 so what s 25 i did 20 i did 15 times 10 so you broke this up i m to a 10 and a 5 right
so you could go 25 times 5 what s 25 times 525 times 5 . what s 4 times 5 it s 125
m 252500 do 3 times you add is 75 correct so that comes out to be 573375 okay
that s why sometimes when you get bigger numbers it s hard to remember all these different numbers inside keeping track of them in your head go ahead i did it different okay i said 10 times 20 equals . i did 10 times 20 okay so you went 10 times 20 yeah equals 200
equals 200 okay and then i said 10 times 5 then 10 times 5 equals 5050 then i said 5 times 20 equals times 20 equals
10100 and 5 times 5 and 5 times 5 equals 25 get 30375 okay stuff did where did you get all this
i got that from last year okay so we have 15 times 25 right yes okay that gives you the 10 times 20
then you did 10 times 5 okay then you went with the 5 20 and then you went 5 times 5 right and that gave us all this stuff right here
that okay way i did i i wrote the m you re making noise okay and i did 13 times 10150 you broke up the 25
yeah so i ll write that up here 15 times 10 okay hold on 12nd whoever is making the noise can you please stop okay so you said 15 times 10 right and where do we get that 150 excellent then what did you do
15 times 415 times 4 where did you get the 4 from 25 i broke it down why didn t you just break it down to a 5
because then it would be what s that if i break it down to 5 then 15 so 15 times 4 yeah what s that nope what s 15 times 4 no i said that that s . what s 15 +15
375 okay good so you broke this 25 up into kind of a different way you broke it up into a 10 and 10 a 4 and a one right and then you just multiplied those all out all right not now
way it s to break them up and then you put on the side of the 15 and you said 25 okay kind of like the stuff we do right now
that it s . it s a little bit too complicated to go over here
down let me just wash this off real quick yep okay we re going to do one more multiplication problem and we re going to solve it a certain way
it this is going to be part of your notes today too so write this problem down
what we re going to add let s see 23 times . 1823 times 18 and i know a lot of you like to solve it using the algorithm 18 and i m going to put 23 times 18
and you can use your paper to solve this one okay if you want to use your pencil and paper to solve it please do today so i want to solve it one way 2410 times 3 is 30
step okay and then i want you to solve it your way up okay copy this down please
desk 16 and 1843 here copy this down just like i solved it
24 this one over here okay make sure you copy it down like i copy it down because i want to show you something i think some of you solved it this way but this is kind of an interesting way to do it way okay okay
yet wait i m just kidding it s right okay so let s solve this this i put 0 is 4 and then you do 6 plus i can t hear
on this is multiplication so it s 8 times 3 we re doing that one yeah 032424 okay so you put down the 4
okay then we re multiplying by this number which is a 10 right is 3 what s one times 2
up 414 so we have 414 correct whatever you re doing you got to stop okay then let s check it my this way over here is the correct way and we get the correct answer too so we have 42 +6 is 8 +3 is one carry the one
one +one is 22 +2 is 4 so this is 414 same here 414 okay it you add no i m asking you can anybody tell me how i how this was solved
it well it s the same so how do you it s the same so how do you hold on chance go ahead how did i break it up
and 30 broke it up into 230 and the yeah added the answer okay what i kind of did i went what s 8 times 3
24 there s your 24 right 20 a 160 right here okay is a 160 oops 10 times 3 is okay then 10 times 20 is 200 then i add them all up
what s that is it 10 times 20 it s 10 times 20 okay okay everyone write this down yes okay the next thing we re going to be talking about are numbers on the number line
what s that another way to okay we re moving on to our number line now
i want you to draw this on a piece of paper okay doing she turned her book sideways like this and draw it just like that
right here okay
that we ve used number lines before for certain things and we ve talked a little bit about using number lines with decimals
today can you copy all of this lines these little dash marks and these little lines in between 123456
10 there s 10 spaces on your number line so the number line s broken up into 10 spaces
for instance if i wanted to put 0.5 on the number line where would that go
in between the 0 and the okay 0.5 okay why don t you come up here
j okay so where do you think this would go on that number line no . no don t put it right down here here now put the point right on where you think it is
go okay do people agree or disagree with that meant you just got to so it s on the 5th one
12345 what is . what is .05 equivalent to as a fraction what is that equivalent to
it we talked about it yesterday okay what is this equivalent to as a fraction 5 over close
10 what is 5 over 10 equal to 101.5 what is it
put there put it right down here go fine how about if i do this in decimal
how about . how about 0.2 go on the
why don t you come on up
oops oops i did it upside down my bad
there you go put that on the line okay does everybody agree with
no i don t that it s on the 3 it s 10 between 10 and one how many spots are there how many spaces are there
12345678910 there s 10 . there s 10 spaces okay so halfway down is right here right down what is that equivalent to as a fraction
know 0.2 is equivalent to this is if this is equal to 5 over 10 what does this one equal to 5 over 1222 over 102102 over 10 okay and the reason is because this is 2 out of 10
into if i broke this up into a 100 spots it would be it would be over a 100 okay because it s . how much the line is broken up into all right so let me do that one
10 okay who wants to put this one up
p then that would go under the . here you go perfect this is where it gets kind of a little bit maybe not
you guys are pretty you can okay so if i do one.2 and we want to put one.2 on this where would that go j did you already came up here didn t you
go the 2nd one after here yeah come on over okay everyone look up here and see if what you were thinking is correct
good excellent now why . why isn t it back here because it s . because those are the ones because zeros okay one excellent and that s what decimals and fractions are numbers if i wanted to do this as a fraction it would be there s a couple of ways we could do it
12 that would be 2.11 how about if we do this one wouldn t it be one over 10 or like 2 point i mean or like one.2 over 10 it s not going to what would it be fraction a half what did we do with this
so it would be 12 tenths 12 over 1012 over 10 is correct how do you know that i took out the decimal you took out the decimal okay this this is one way to do it okay
this is . this is 10 you do a whole number and a fraction and a fraction that s a mixed number so you have one and 2 tenths okay 0 but you can also do it like said
10 i said that equals 12 over 10 and the reason . the reason why it s worth it could be worth 12 over 10 too is because 10 over 10 equals to one
10 and then you can add that with the 2 over 10s so it s kind of yeah i want someone to come up here okay why don t you come up here you can put this what number 03
can t here i ll let you do the next 11 okay our next number fantastic job cool okay our next number is this and i think you guys get this i think you think like decimal . decimal people
okay so let s this one is one.8 it would be . it would be one.8 shh don t la la la think struggle with this a little bit
smarter to struggle will make you smarter
yes yes okay do you want to come up here thank you sir 0 and we can get that pointy point right on this okay so you went down how many . how many spaces
123456788 perfect agree and how about if we wanted to make that into a mixed number this one equals one and 8 over 10 wow very good you guys get it
very good i want to i don t know if you re ready for this one though i think you might be i think teacher d we re ready for anything you think you re ready for anything okay me why not you why not you to okay i ll find someone else you no
b okay i want to give you this one this one s thank you ma am we ll get it remember this is not equivalent
fantastic okay now the next one and you got to give yourselves some time to think about this one all right wait teacher d i have a question yep go ahead you know when you have a decimal like one.80 yeah how does that i ll show you
i ll show you and we re going to actually kind of i m going to do that right now
good i m just going to erase this just so we have a little bit more room up there okay here s the question
fall one . okay one.551.55 where would that fall
please you re saying well we can just count down 55 okay but we don t have 55 that s what i just put okay so what do we do somewhere and where do you . and where do you think this number is i think if you just did this . if we just did that where would that fall
right there okay on the line that s what i okay 12345 so you say it might land right about there somewhere right teacher d i was thinking that one through 5 would be like right there before you get to the last okay here what is the difference between this number and that number
think 1st off you guys you re talking about thinking say what is the difference between this number and that number you know decimals this is not whole numbers like if i say what s the difference between one 15 and 155
if you compare these 2 numbers that s a lot of difference in comparing this and this right so where what s the difference good they re just . they re up to 5 away from each other they re 5 away from each other
think i think that there s 2 different places yeah they are 2 different places okay how about this number this one.6 where s that number on the number line like it s going to be right 712345 so it would be right here right here s one.5 there s one.6
what if i told you . this number is in between those 2 numbers be i don t think it can be because like you don t have to but think about it
instead remember we talked a little bit about this is tenths so this is one and 5 tenths this is one and 6 tenths it is okay this is one and 55 tenths they call me the clapper not 55 tenths 50 tenths 5.5 tenths hundredths 551 hundredths so what does that mean
you remember yesterday s example when we had those tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny little boxes 0 yeah so if we put instead of having 10 . instead of having 10 little lines we put 100 lines okay
if we put 100 tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny little lines there which i can t do because i can t write that small but if we had 10 lines in between there then we can go up to the 50 which is right here then go 5 more and 5 more would be halfway through between the 5 and the 6 okay so the fraction the decimal is actually in between those 2 numbers
middle you put that up there and we re going to be doing more of this over the coming weeks and i m hoping go ahead
question what if . what if it says like it says like 0.78 and if it has lines would we put 0.078 or know we ll talk about it when we get there a little bit
6 and if we did this as a fraction can anybody figure out what the mixed fraction would be on this one what 0 it s already up on the board
doing can you pass those out please can you pass these out for me please thank you
good work everyone is this getting any clearer than it was yesterday like i said fractions and decimals because i m telling you you ll wake up in the middle of the night and go i get it you ll go . i don t get it okay so why don t we turn to . are we doing page 15
15171819 okay i want you to take out page 17
017 i told you 17161718 okay right now
right now what i want you to do is take out page unit 6 page 17 please what did i ask you to do we all need to be focused b unit 6 page 17
now seats what did i ask you to open up 17 yeah but not right now we ll do it afterwards unit 6 page 17
this page guess what
you want to see this right okay on this . on this what i want you to do is i want to put 4 numbers . so you have the number line one through let me just move this over
17 you have 4 number lines
on the 1st one i want you to write i want you to write this number on the . number line for number 10.30 . 3 tenths i want you to put on the number one number line
put a dot and put that 3 tenths underneath it okay yeah okay i m going to have you put a couple of numbers on that number line
that s not 0.3 how can that be 0.3 i just put that d they are away 0
good let us start today for math today we are going to talk about our objective which is to find combinations of 3 digit numbers that add to make 1000
so we are thinking 3 digit plus another 3 digit number to make closest to 1000 and we are going to determine the difference between 1000 and the total of 3 digit combinations
so you have in front of you that you had out earlier when we played last week the other game were these digit cards the game is called close to 1000 all right in it you have an array of cards 0 to 9 and the awesome wild card
the wild card is awesome because you can change it into any digit that you want you can make it 0 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9 you can put it anywhere that you want and make your number combination can we get up to 100
9 good question so we are going to play a game called close to 1000 where you and your partner will play the game and the object is close to 1000 so what you will do is you will deal out 8 cards it so just have an idea of what i want how to play the game
sense okay so just randomly pick out 8 cards okay between you and your partner you don t have to pick anything out right now you only need one deck of cards and then you deal out 8 cards for yourself and your partner deals out 8 cards for him or herself
far with that i have 8 digits here my job is to find a 3 number combination and another 3 number combination using these cards once it is kind of similar to what you played last year in 3rd grade called close to 100 but this one we want to challenge you a little more so we are going to play close to 1000
so you pick 3 digits write it down another 3 digits write it down and then find a total what is the sum of these 23 digit number combinations score now your job is to figure out how far is your total number to 1000 okay
yes after that for example i take 6 cards out then deal another 6 cards and constantly i will have 8 cards to pick from then the cards you use you can put in another separate pile and when you run out of cards you can shovel it up and reuse from that pile again score you add them all up and that is your final score
whoever has the lowest score if you have 3 of you playing together is the winner of that game sense who can help me out what digit should i use so i can get closer to 1000
and 4 and 5 place what does that make exactly so i would have 648 352 and i have exactly 1000 so my score would be 0
object i want the score to be 0 or close to 0 because at the end whoever has the lowest score wins right so we will talk about the strategies later one obviously was thinking about the 100s the 10s and the ones and how important it is to place each digit in the right spot
so as you are playing i want you to think about the strategy you use to find the closest to 1000 no so these 6 cards are out then i am going to deal out 6 new cards again
it could be one 9 4 5 and i may have a wild card and i may have a 0 okay so you again try to figure out what are some of the 3 digit number combinations that can help you to get to 1000 or closest to 1000 sense you have to keep track of it because at any time when your friends say i am not sure
i am not sure if that comes up to be 1000 then we can go back and check it that is why it is so important to keep track of what we are doing j 0 you can use it to no okay i have another question okay what if you get a wild card what is a wild card is number you make it whatever you want 0 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
does that make sense no so again i am so glad you brought that up because if the number goes over 1000 do i have to subtract no it is just however far away it is from 1000
so if your combination equals to like i have here what did i do 459 +504 my answer is 1006
so if that is the case then what is my score 6 you notice that i used a u s algorithm you can use that to check your work or the other strategies we talked about when you add
if you need a scrap paper i would be more than happy to provide you with one or to save a tree you can use the back to help you sheet each of you will get 8 cards dealt in front of you
bag for example if and i were partners i do not need to bring my bag and she doesn t need to bring her bag no please go make sure you have your pencil and one person at least gets a deck of cards
is i will come talk to you it is fine make sure you are on the left side
way this camera is off but i want to make sure you do not sit in front of it
go have a seat please
go what do you need
i will do this right now cards wow you picked 3 wild cards at the same time
write it down 483 you said one earlier right do you agree with that you have to take this card then you put your 8
we will put it here so we will not be confused i want you to think about what is your strategy 1st what would you use
you have 4 wild cards can i do it like this you can do whatever you like you need a 3 digit so you need 2 more cards
cards you had 999 and you said you needed one quickly because 999 +one equals 1000 okay so we are going to put the one right here in the ones place what are you going to put here 0 and 0 there you go
if that were the case what would that get changed to 100s okay all right does that make sense we have 9 cards so that one goes back
i was so shocked i had a wild card really now it is your turn
already you have got to keep track of what she is doing doing good once i had all 8s and all 9s i got 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 did she agree to that with that
kind i have got it how are you guys doing you got 1001
that is good these are the cards that you used yourself you do not use the same cards where is the pile that you used already okay use your score is 99
it next time think about how you are going to better use your numbers out you can move them around to do whatever you need to do
better you still have 3 other digits what are you doing what is your answer
1030 can you make it even smaller now what is it 20 can you do an even better job
900 can you do even better not that is farther away
around you have this be how far are you away from 1000
you think about how you can move numbers around your number gets smaller up if i have 93 do i need to try to make it closer to 1000
yes how are you guys doing over here you have to have 3 digits at all times
look what you have right here you have more than 8 cards you have 9 cards boys and girls you are a little too loud excitement all right
you what do you want to do do i want to use the wild card can you explain to me what is the wild card 987 plus what do you want to add to it here does that make sense
time very good doing very good how are we doing over here
time what do you need to do you can put 0 if you have a 0 differently you have 791 +640
that we do not remember what the other 2 digits was
do you still have those 2 digits so what do you need with the 6 digits you have in front of you what can you do differently let me ask you another one
numbers is the number too big or too small 197 would that be too far from 1000
point you are right 431 is a very big number to be away from 1000 so when you are putting your numbers together you have to think about the placement of your digits place you have 357
437 okay here okay
is this a wild card what are you going to do
after the 1st one all of yours were 1000 doing i always put the number that combines with 10 at the ones place and the numbers that do not combine with 10 in the middle like 4 and 5
this one would equal to when you put it it would be one
10 the ones place i would just put so correct me if i am wrong what you are saying is that is your strategy
what you are saying is for the ones place you need to make a combination of 10 for the 10s place you need a combination of 9 because you have the one to carry over for the 100s you also need a combination of 9 to come back to here
strategy may i ask you what happens if you do not have a combination of 10 and you do not have a wild card
do i would put an 8 at the ones place what do you think
so you are saying instead of starting at the ones place you should start at the 100s place
interesting so you start out with the 100s strategy you start out with the 10s ones to find a combination of 1000s do you find a combination of 10 or another combination
you know how was saying for the ones you would have 2 and 8 right and for the 10s he would have a combination of 9 4 and 5 and for the 100s he would have another combination of 10 loud only one person if you have a question you can definitely share your strategy
i love that but it is getting too loud so my question to you is when you are at the 100s place do you use combinations or no combinations at all you know what i am talking to her
you same thing wait i think this one is the most perfect i am sorry i am not following you so you are using the 100s place because you want to find what is closest to 1000
then if it is not closer to 1000 if i put the fewest one in the middle it will be like 10 is so she is saying she would start out with 100
do you think that is efficient do you think that would be a good strategy to use that what was your question it does not make 1000 10 you did not 0 why do you keep changing numbers
my question to you is should not you have come up with that before you added up the total to find this out be you can not make it into 10 so what do you think you should do with the 10s placement
that is good you know what you could have done differently you kept it the way you had it which is fine you could have made this 190
does that make sense how you doing over here what was your question can i shuffle yes you can
here share your strategy how you guys doing over here 66 you guys finished one round one game
1000 that would mean you have less points good where 1st i do the 100s you start out with the 100s then i do the highest 10s then the highest ones if i have for example i have 29s
not because you would go over 1000 and have a lot of points you do not want that so how do you determine which goes where i noticed in the 100s place here you have a 9 and a 0 100 500 900 0
way obviously it worked quite a bit for you in these 4 problems where you have 0 and one thinking my thinking was going overboard one point or 2 points to 1000
did i was trying to make it to 1000 you need to sit
i was only going to 1000 but some were too high so you are constantly referring to i want to make it to 1000 which is great
you boys and girls about 5 more minutes you i need you to write 200
cards okay i want the 2 of you to just work on these 8 cards these 6 cards that you have how can you make it even closer to 1000
hard it is 911
lot you have when he has his 191 it is roughly it is closest to 100 800 you have these numbers left
do you have got to keep these the way they are that because if you do 52 then it is larger yeah the number becomes bigger
1016 is not that a lot closer can you make it even bigger you have 191 +825 so it is 160 right can you do even better while you are doing that i want you to think about what you are doing
them how is it going to help you to determine which is closer to 1000 i will come back guys how are you guys doing i heard bad cards cards sometimes you need a 2 sometimes you do not need a 2
how many points did you get all together it is 2
job are you going to help her out
900 how about this why do you think i did that
what was i doing making it closer switching it
using why did not i use the 5 there imagine if i had done this
it would have been 1110 right if i had done this it would have been 1040
1004 what was i doing with the digits
6 because the 10s is higher than the ones so if i make the 10s bigger you need to make the 10s smaller to make the 100s smaller exactly because i am already at 1000 right here
away all right guys what did you boys come up with what were the cards we were talking about it how are we doing over here
809 how are we doing over here boys and girls i need you to put the cards back in the bag and return to your seat i know everybody at least got to play one game one round do not consciously walk in front of it
it you were right there it is a little confusing because you have to move let us see which team is ready
i like what i am seeing from you can go back there aye aye captain right you ready honey okay cards you do not need to touch anything so far
there were a lot of interesting talks about how you place cards and i love what i heard from unsure naturally helped her and said you can do it this way and make the number smaller she was way off 1000
nice who can tell me i got a chance to talk to one team where they actually tried to explain the strategy which is kind of cool and were trying to explain to me their strategy and is strategy is similar to is but different in certain ways
can you please share with us what is your strategy
whatever works best for you however you want to explain to all of us
if you have put it in the ones place if you have 2 cards that came out that can make 9 put them here then the 100s place all right what in the world is he talking about who can tell me what he is talking about all right obviously it worked for him because what did that come out to
1000 who can tell me what is he talking about maybe you can explain to us again what does that mean and what was your thinking behind it
j who can explain to me what just said to us e can you be a little louder you he said to make numbers that combine to make 10
so you need the digits to combine 10 to put in the ones place and he said you should not do that to the 100s place who can tell me why you should not do that to the 100s place if you plus it with a 9 it will go over 1000 and you will get a lot of points do you want to add to that
correct me if i am wrong but you are saying if you have a combination of 10 for the 100s place you have numbers in the 10s and the ones place and then you will be 2 far from 1000 strategy what do you think about his strategy
he is saying in the 100s place you should not put a combination of 10 why because if you put in the 100s place it will be more than 100
1000 yeah so what is your strategy for the 10s place
the 10s place find a number that makes 9 why because 2 +8 equals 10
10 sorry all right what do you think can you explain to me
me so anyone have any question about is ideas about why he thinks it is better to have a combination of 9 for the 100s place
if you have way too much the numbers are more than 9 then you go over way too much j i know you are very nervous about standing there so i am not going to torture you
again correct me if i am not correct and i misinterpreted what you just said so said for the 100s place you should always have a combination of 9 strategy i know the camera might actually block your vision
there does that help okay so he is saying that you should have a combination of 9 because if you have how can i do the algorithm if you have this you will have 900 something right
but if you have a really big combination here for example 7 and 6 you put them all in the 100s place that is already 1300 and you are way far from 1000 he is saying if you have really small numbers like a 2 and a 3 and you put them in the 100s place then you only have 500 and you are still too far
so his thinking is the best for you to do is 9 and another reason for that in addition to these is you still have digits here you want to give yourself some room to get to 1000 far so then he said for the 10s i also want combinations of 9
can you explain to me why is that if you have a combination of 9 like 990 you just need 10 more so if you do a combination of 9 then you have 990 something but you still have room here
something right now you are only 10 away from 1000 so then now you have you are controlling your numbers however big and however small you want
here he said if you can do a combination of 10 for the ones place then it would be perfect because now for example i have 7 and 3
1000 does that make sense yes that was his strategy think good all right that is not just one strategy
told me 1st he thought it was ones then the 10s then the 100s but said she actually starts with the 100s then 10s then ones it i want you think is there one that is more efficient i was talking to and he was saying i like to do it this way
when i put my cards i like to put them this way so i can see u s algorithm where i can do this and i know which is a one a 10 a 100 i saw a lot of you did that me you had to find the one strategy that was most efficient for you
anything i want you to think then said to me i want to make it 9 i think you said something like that too big if it is too big then it is way off from 1000 and if it is 9 it is not too far from 1000 again we talked bout controlling your numbers
then i also had someone who said you pick a number that is really big here or here your number is going to be really big came up one time with a lot of big numbers and she had 2 small numbers he helped her and said to put your big numbers in the ones place think about all that strategy and all that thinking that is involved when playing this game
some of us your score was like a one a 0 2 3 4 5 some of us our score was like 400 true you can have some bad cards but how do you make the best out of it there is strategies that kick in to help you make the best of the situation
so i want you to think about the strategy you use today when you are playing the game and think about what is the most efficient way to get closest to 1000 strategy i do not want you to think it is like you are the best you have the best strategy ever i am not saying that i am just happy that he is willing to share or at least i forced him to share
i want you to think about what is a strategy that works if you look at your score and you go man i had 172 you know what maybe you should start thinking about other people is strategies if your number is one 2 3 4 5 you know what you can say hey my strategy might be pretty good i was able to control my strategy to get it closest to 1000 what is your strategy
i want you to think about that tonight because tomorrow we are going to play this game again and i want you to do a better job so tonight for homework i want you to i am going to give you another sheet great tonight i want you to play 2 rounds and the focus here is the strategy
1000 if you like is strategy or is or is that is great you try it you maybe it does not or maybe you are just like who had some really bad cards and happened to have some really awesome cards all right does that make sense yes
you i will give you another sheet do we just play one game 2 games that is so sad
ready boys and girls today we are going to be learning a new game called decimal war
so the 1st thing that i want to do with you is put the instructions to the game up on the board everyone is going to be getting a copy of these instructions while they play with their partners
to so our objectives today students will be able to create a decimal to the 100th place who can remind me what does a decimal to the 100th place look like
r what do you mean at the end m so to the 100th place remember way back in september when we started going over place value we went over decimal place values
so i see 23 before my decimal point number and then i see a one and a 5 after my decimal point m this number is written to the 100th place me 23 and 15 hundredths excellent thank you
23 and 15 hundredths remember where this decimal point is we can use the word and everything after the decimal point we are going to read together so we see a one and a 5 we are going to read it as 15 the 2nd place after the decimal point is the 100th place
so we are going to read this as 23 and 15 hundredths 2nd objective for today is game students will be able to rearrange numeral cards to create the largest decimal possible
so this is kind of about ordering decimals so let us say i pulled the decimal cards 3 5 one and 7
cards and i asked you to give me a decimal to the 100th place using 2 of those cards but i want you to give me the largest decimal possible who can tell me which card would i use the 3 the 5 the one and the 7 are your choices
a wants me to use the 7 and the 5 clearly these are the largest numerals up here but where do you want me to put them in here this 1st place is called the 10th place the 100th 100th place so where do you want me to put those cards
so said the 7 in the 10th place and the 5 in the 100th place me remember we read everything after the decimal point together
c good 0 and 75 hundredths any questions so far our 3rd objective here students will be able to compare decimals using more than less than and equal to signs
so that means let us say i put up here the decimal who can read this decimal to me j 0 and 24 hundredths good 0 and 24 hundredths who can read this decimal to me
t 0 and 19 hundredths good 0 and 19 hundredths i am going to ask you to compare those 2 decimals and tell me is it more than less than or equal to
24 hundredths is more than 19 hundredths 24 hundredths is less than 19 hundredths or 24 hundredths is equal to 19 hundredths
today the game is called decimal war 1st thing we are going to do is review the directions for this game after we review the direction we will go ahead and play a round of the game together so you can see what my expectations are
and then i am going to pair you off into groups and you can work with your partner playing the game c remove all the 4 wild cards and shuffle the remaining numeral cards great
cards in these numeral decks of cards there are wild cards today that being said you know we are going to continue this game next week in centers right we do a pretty good job today if we can do a great job next week in centers then the following week i might let you use the wild cards
what would the wild cards be for any number good picking any number that you want r higher number exactly you are trying to get a very large decimal so if you got to pick which numeral you wanted which digit you wanted to use you could pick which one would work best for you
so the 1st thing we are going to do remove all 4 wild cards and shuffle the remaining cards this is actually a very important step cause a lot of these cards are in order going number 2 who can read number 2 for me
j evenly divide the pile of numeral cards between you and your partner mean who can clarify that for me j when you play cards how do you evenly divide them
do you give yourself 15 and then your partner 15 today one for your partner one for you one for your partner one for you
t that was kind of a lot in there cards in war in a typical game of war you have a stack of cards and your partner has a stack of cards
in a typical game of war how many cards are you drawing card your partner draws a card and you compare them cards you are going to take those cards and you are going to use them to create 2 decimals to the 100th place where the whole number is going to be 0
so for example your recording sheet will look like this where you have a spot for 2 decimals they both have the whole number as 0 but then there is a 10th and a 100th spot where you will fill in the digit according to the cards that you draw
now it says remember you are trying to make the largest number possible so you can put your cards in any of these 4 spots that you want trying again to make the largest number possible a good so i am going to show you an example of the recording sheet in a minute
but what you are going to do is you are going to add those 2 decimals that you created
so let us say for example you created the decimal 34 hundredths and you also created the decimal 87 hundredths your next job is going to be to add these together
so let us do that together as a class what is 4 +7 11 so i am going to put my one and carry my what is 3 +8 do put the 2 at the bottom carry the one
good do not forget pull down that decimal now what goes in my whole number spot my ones place sum the answer in an addition problem is the sum
g excellent one and 21 hundredths now while you are doing all this work guess what your partner is doing thing your partner is doing the same work on their recording sheet once they get their answer you are going to write it right on your recording sheet
so let us say their sum is one and 2 hundredths in between your sum and their sum will be a circle
circle guess what you are putting in the middle of that circle
anyways one and 21 hundredths compared to one and 2 hundredths now what i would like you to do is read the whole thing out loud to me starting here telling me less than greater than or equal to and finishing with this
a and i am going to come back here one and 21 hundredths is greater than one and 2 hundredths excellent job a one and 21 hundredths is greater than one and 2 hundredths so you put a greater than sign in the circle
here good so moving on we have added our decimals we have recorded our sum and our partner is sum on the recording sheet number 5 says do you want to read this one for me
great already so you are going to compare your sum to your partner is sum
e so it is just a little typo there the player with the largest number wins all 8 cards for that round and can place a star under the round number
so if you are playing 4 cards and your partner is playing 4 cards how many cards are being played in that round total number 7 says continue onto round 2 number 8 the player with the most cards at the end of round 5 wins today whoever ends with the most cards wins
so we have gone over the objectives now yes will we be doing this at our seat or like so i am going to have you stay right in your seat today next week we will take this game and we will put it into our center round any other questions
together and let me show you what the recording sheet looks like so here is your decimal war recording sheet we are going to play you guys against me
sheet so the 1st thing you are going to do is put your name right on it cards there should be 4 of them it is what i am thinking in each deck that is 23
3 so the next thing we are going to do is shuffle those cards up get them good and mixed and then we are going to pass them out me and you would just continue this all the way to the end of the deck
cards what is my next step c each of us get to draw 4 cards pick and i am going to lay them out right here i will put it up here for you
i have a 5 a 3 a 4 and a 6 cards you have a 0 a one a 4 and a 3 what is my next step
you have to pick the numbers that you want to so we have to pick the numbers that we want to use you so if these are my 4 cards what do you think my 1st decimal could be
e what should my 1st decimal be you can choose any of these top 4 cards those ones are mine what so i used my 4
6 so i am going to use a 6 here me 46 hundredths excellent 46 hundredths now i have a 5 and a 3 left
m and obviously i have to use my 3 so can you read that decimal to me remember we are going to read everything after the decimal point together
so read this number together good 53 hundredths next step 9 4 +5 is
turn there is not a spot on the recording sheet for your partner to do theirs numbers you have 2 decimals that you are going to make
0 and 43 hundredths so she wants me to do 43 hundredths and 0 and 10 hundredths and 10 hundredths if you add them up 3 +0 is 5 who can read the sum for me
j 0 and 53 hundredths 0 and 53 hundredths is there anyone that thinks they can get a larger sum anyone want to try to use those same digit cards to get a larger sum
is can you read that for me
0 and 71 hundredths good 0 and 71 hundredths which one should we use we are going to use the 0 and 71 hundredths because it is the larger decimal we want to use the largest decimal possible
does anyone think they could have made a larger decimal over here
10 then i am going to put my 0 carry my one point who can read this whole number sentence for me using greater than less than or equal to
s is greater than 0 and 71 hundredths excellent one and 8 hundredths is greater than 71 hundredths so i am going to put a greater than sign here and that means i get all 8 cards
so i am going to take all 8 cards and i am going to put them off to the sides 2 so i would draw another 4 cards
you would draw another 4 cards and you would go through the same thing again practice so yes you are allowed to help your partner round when i am walking around to each of the groups here is what i am going to be looking for
i am going to look to see that you are following the directions of the game and trying to create the largest decimal possible i am going to look to see that you are reading the decimals out loud to each other and practicing how to read a decimal like we were doing up here i am also going to be looking to see how you work in a pair
we have been doing a lot of talking about how we treat each other how we talk to each other so one of the things i am looking for today is how you are working together e what honey sure go ahead i am going to leave this on the board in case you would like to refer back to something
group so the 1st thing you do remove the wild cards shuffle your deck
sheets everybody gets their own recording sheet today
top names on the top write your names on the top of the recording sheets guys and 4 wild yeah i think there should be 4
game put those off to the side we are not going to use them let us see everybody kinda getting started i see people shuffling them out
one do not worry about those i will put them in for you
so you know what you are doing so at this point you should have already shuffled the deck and passed them out
i want you to get going i know i am supposed to look at it but no so what you are going to do is when you get your own pile you shuffle them up
4 those are the 4 cards that you are going to work with teacher are we going to be watching video probably not
game you know what i think some of these cards some decks have more cards than others have not including the wilds
you need another paper do not put your names on those boys looks like we are off to a good start
other es so why do not you start and tell me why do not you read to me your whole number sentence 76 hundredths +0 and 76 hundredths +0 and 52 hundredths equals one and 28 hundredths and how about
0 and 63 hundredths +0 and 91 hundredths equals one and 54 hundredths so one thing that i want to mentioned that is you can keep reading it the way that you are reading it to it represents that there are no wholes so you can just tell me the decimal portion of your number
so you could read this as 63 hundredths +91 hundredths equals and now we have to say the whole number because it is no longer 0 we have something you would say one and 54 hundredths so who won excellent job
on to round 2
you can go ahead on to finish that round and draw your cards for round 2 guys how we doing over here who can tell me what we have done so far
i got 0 and hundredths so read this number again for me 0 and 63 hundredths try again and he got one and 13 hundredths so who won
won cause he got a higher number he got a higher number now make sure that you are using the cards that you drew in a way that is going to give you largest number possible
so i know that my tenths place is larger than my hundredths place
me one and 34 hundredths that is your sum read the whole number sentence to me 0 and 64 hundredths +0 and 70 equals one and 34 hundredths excellent you are up
bud one and 83 hundredths can you read the whole number sentence to me one and 83 hundredths is greater than one and 34 hundredths very good if you won that round give yourself a star
did not get the same as you sweetheart got one and 83 hundredths how we doing over here
one excellent tell me what you did i did 0 and 96 hundredths you can read it as just 96 hundredths that was fine 96 hundredths excellent job
you do you think that there is a way you could have arranged those cards to get an even larger number think about your place values you have the tenths place and the hundredths place why do not you try it off to the side and see what it comes out to
so hang on 12nd well what is 4 +2 6 so put a 6 in the hundredths place 15 so what are you going to put in the tenths place
excellent read your new sum to me there one and 56 hundredths is that greater than one and 38 hundredths yeah
job yes guys we are on the last 2 cards so what you need to do is go ahead and pull 2 cards from the deck that you won just to finish up that round no from the top from the top yes so some of you are finishing up can i just say what an awesome job you have done with this game
you are more than ready for this to be part of your center next week one raise your hand if you won round 2 5 she already won all of them game that would be the person with the most cards
very good now listen here is your challenge today challenge work together with your partner to find the difference between your sum and their sum mean subtraction subtraction look up here on your subtraction sign you will find the word difference
so for example i would say one and 8 hundredths -0 and 71 hundredths what is 8 -one 7 what is 0 -7 so what do you want me to do
so the one becomes a 0 yeah excellent read my difference work with your partner and find the difference for each of your rounds
you guys are all set you all set guys you guys are doing great so do you know what the next thing i am asking you do is
it find the difference for each of your rounds you can find somewhere and write on the sheet do you have any questions on this game no okay which one can you read me is
greater than it is the same thing 0 it is greater than one and hundredths excellent job
going how we doing over here you can work together on that if you want to or you can each do it and make sure you have the same answer it is up to you
cause i would like this cause there is more space like that that is fine if that makes it easier that is fine i won 2 times nice job it is not fair it is not fair well maybe next time you will win
rounds that is great that seemed lots better thank you welcome you can both go move a pin up rounds very good how would we do
now can you do me a favor me 0 and 9600s is greater than is less than one and 80 hundredths one and 80 hundredths excellent job can you please read this whole number sentence to me
one and 71 hundredths is greater than one and 54 hundredths excellent job very good guys how we doing over here look at you i only won once once cards do not like me
me but you know what i am looking at the ones that you did and i see you did make the largest number as possible can you go ahead and read why do not you read round 5 for me one and 74 hundredths is greater than 0 and 56 hundredths excellent job
good and how about you read round 2 for me one and 37 hundredths is greater than one and 7 hundredths very good yes no you are about to go to lunch in just a few minutes you can wait
do take all of your digit cards and your wild cards and put them back inside the baggies let us get everything cleaned up yeah would you mind and put them right back into the red drawer for me so boys and girls listen excellent job today
impressed i was listening to how you were working together and you did a very good job i also loved that you were able to read these decimals when i left you in the fall this was kind of something that was a shaky topic
well can i please have everybody put their cards back in the bags if you can not handle it listen stop it some people put them back by themselves
okay if you are done with your cards just come up and put them in the red bin for me everybody is getting a ticket towards this week is drawing because you did such a nice job today clean we will come around with tickets
good perfect all right guys we re actually starting something you re going to love today i think i mentioned like last week or something but it s called geometryville
now what it s going to do all the geometry stuff that we had in our flipbook so lines rays polygons some of the 3 d figures all of those things are included on the list what you re going to do is draw a town you make it up completely imagination
you make up a city a town a little world whatever and you re going to draw a picture of it kind of like a map like you re flying in an airplane over your little town it your only job is to make sure that in your city you include all of these things
now i m going to be using this to grade i ll be checking off to make sure you have it but you use this as a checklist too to make sure you don t miss anything because there s so much on here terms so if i were you i would check off on the left side of it to make sure you ve done each one or do one little thin line and kind of cross them out do you know what i mean but don t scribble over it because then i won t be able to see the labels when i m grading
g can we do one of those more than once one of the shapes yeah you can have and you will because if you re doing buildings and stuff for example without me drawing it what shape is a building c rectangular prism a rectangular prism it could be if it was like this
so if are a doing a city you re not just going to have one building right so you might have lots of rectangular prisms to answer your question but you ll only need to label one of them k if it has how would we draw a line it never stops okay you re right a line never stops
so we talked about lines in this room even if you think about on the map something you could see that could be a demonstration of a line something going straight in both directions for ever road a road okay so say maybe in your city you have straight road right when you label it you only have t pick and label one you can even label the sides of one of these buildings as a line
with the line you re just going to have to get kind of creative and we re going to go over these shapes in just a 2nd to make sure you remember all of them which i m pretty sure you do but just in case i have a feeling that we re going to be using lots of parallel lines you might
example because i m going to give you a sheet of computer paper and that s where you ll draw your little world and this is one i did a couple of years ago be and part of the thing on here you ll see part of the grid there s 20 items and each one is worth a point
it and then coloring is worth 5 points so it does need to be all colored your goal is to have no white left on your paper okay like a poster kind of and then neatness is worth 3 points so you might want to do it in pencil 1st especially when you re labeling or you re writing something i would use pencil 1st because when people use a marker they make a mistake and sometimes you re wanting to start all over and it s just time consuming
points we ll be working on this for probably 2 days and then tomorrow no today is our focus day is today tuesday yes yes ma am okay then we re goo then days but you draw your picture on one side hold on hands down real quick and i would have your checklist beside you each time you draw one i would put a little dot next to it over here or a little checkmark
then after you have everything i m going to give you a piece of this this transparent transparent it s called a transparency they use to us it for the overhead projectors which i don t even use that any more because we ve got that thing but you put this on top and staple it just 2 times and on this sheet is where you do the labels
let me see if i can put this under here to show you
so on that page you trace over the things that you drew and you label them so for example my road down here i have a right angle
there so on my paper i traced over just the right angle on the road and labeled it and for the line thing you were asking about i used the side of my road
forever but then on my transparency i just traced part of it and put the arrows on both sides and labeled it line that your world does not need to look like mine your world can be anything it can be something in space or you can create a new planet thinking about some science stuff
you can think about some social studies stuff and do explorers and just invent a place see mine includes most of the things but i ve changed your list just a little bit
ray it s where when one line point towards the other and goes on okay can anybody give examples of things you could think would start somewhere and shoot off forever a cul de sac a cul de sac okay a cul de sac right here where there s a turn around in the road you know that s like a gigantic end and then it goes off in one direction forever
sun i did lightly endpoints with the arrows shooting off into different directions are we for example where it has the ray on the street are we allowed to use also for a circle like where there s a circle there are we allowed to us things 2 times do you all hear her question it s a good one
she s saying for that part in the road where s it s going like this i could label this on my transparency i ll use a different colored one i could on the transparency do like this and label it ray she s saying could i also use this and use circle
this now it will probably be neater as far as the drawing and labeling on your transparency if you do them separate and you re going to have so much going on in your town you ll be surprised by what you spot you know even if you do a little sign on one of your buildings or peoples heads if you do little stick figures and they re little heads are little circles or spheres
you know so you ll be surprised kind of what comes out of just your natural town yeah your drawing g how do you like draw a sphere a sphere what shape is a sphere a circle it s circular and then to make it look 3 d you just kind of color the sides of it like shadowing like pretend the light is coming down from one direction
so if your light was coming down from over here this would be light and this would be your dark side this and it helped it look like a like a okay let s go over and like i said i ll hang this on the board so if you guys want to come peak at it or get ideas or whatever you re welcome to
yeah will be working on this in class or at home in class only good question you re going to leave this here every day and it s purely done here but you have all day today and all day tomorrow and if we need a 3rd day we ll use it but i m planning for 2
is i need a good black marker yes cube
a cube is 4 right angles and 4 parallel lines is a cube a quadrilateral no share some thoughts on that i think it has 6 square faces it s 3 d quadrilateral it s flat it s flat that s how they re different
you re talking about a figure and we re talking about 3 d something faces okay the next thing on there is a square pyramid it has a square at the bottom but you re going to kind of draw like a rhombus
yes and it has rays coming up edges just describe the faces and kind of what they do together they come together at one point perfect
4 triangle faces meeting at a point things in mine i had a random desert with egyptian pyramids can anybody think of some other triangular pyramid stuff you could draw 0 how about a house the top of a house yeah sure the roof
i mean but you could do tons of things hat i have a quick one question one more thing about the map how would we color in like the 3 d shapes or what they look like if it s just a flat . okay another good question did you all hear 0 yes okay how do you color it in so it s not all looking like one thing and you re keeping it looking 3 d
i would make the lines for your stuff i would outline it in black and then when you color it don t color so dark that you can t see those lines sense yes or sometimes if you use 2 slightly different colors that works like for example these 2 different greens sometimes you color in how dark you do like this
that can do it too because then you re kind of doing like a shadow thing as well so either way
all right that is a square pyramid rectangular prism you guys already showed me i m going to draw them up here real fast and then i ll label them in a 2nd after i give you your paper cones
it has one circle face okay it doesn t matter where don t get stuck thinking about these shapes as one way like sitting like this or like an ice cream cone remember when you re drawing and being creative i mean this thing can be whatever
it could be all kinds of things
cylinder what s a cylinder it has good girl sphere
it has pretty much it s a ball
that what s a line a line is something with no end point ew does a line have end points no with no end points g it goes on forever yeah what do you have all over your hand buddy huh
ink no science in science for mother s day 0 you all are doing a project yeah for mother s day a point it s when like one dot
the dot of a pencil good yeah one i can t say one dot in space one place m it s a line but it just has okay what did you say
are we going to do a point in 0 i know you could do a dot as an eyeball tons of things sun tons of things any little spot on your paper like i said think about your drawing 1st and then you ll find some of these things naturally
g it has it s a line is with one acute angle yep something tiny
b 2 things an obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees okay yes that i need to be buying flowers right angle a right angle is exactly 90 degrees perfect and it looks like a what
smart a perfect little corner intersecting lines and that s all it says intersecting okay it doesn t matter how they just need to cross
again it likes the microphone to hear it parallel what is that super perpendicular it s like a quiz in anything in geometry we ever discussed
perpendicular when something crosses and it makes 4 perfect angles perfect yes ma am circle a circle fabulous do you want to describe it
it s flat and with a circle shape what s another way to say it without saying circle a round shape a round shape that works and it has a hole in it pentagon 5 hexagon 6 okay also when i was talking about not getting stuck in the way you think about something remember a pentagon has how many sides 62 pentagon
55 and you re used to seeing it in your textbook and stuff something that looks like this but remember as long as it has 5 sides and they are . no straight straight and the figure is . pentagon so 12 that s not straight i got excited
on all right 12345 is that a pentagon yes so don t get stuck in your head about what something usually looks like just remember what it is okay you get 2 seconds to look at the board and review and i m going to erase because otherwise it s going to be like a cheat sheet for you and i want to see on your geometry though what you remember
ready 12 any questions can it stay up on the board no paper man my stomach is having a party this morning
started it doesn t matter also sorry which way your paper faces this way or that way all you re world is your world thank you the world s your universe dream large deal you may sing you can t dance and you ve got to still be being productive
if we re screwing around the music goes off can we sure do the mix
and then tomorrow i ll give you the transparency and you can work on labeling and go through and kind of cross them off or check them a 2nd time to make sure you labeled them all can i pass out the checklist yes list when you get this put your name at the top so if it ends up on the floor we know whose is whose
ole are you going to put your example on the board yes
you okay we have mj and we have that fast mixed cd if you want to hear raise your hand
i don t think she s listening if you want to hear mj raise your hand cd okay let s try again michael jackson mixed cd care michael jackson mix cd
all right did you get one for yourself yes can we get rulers yeah if you all need the rulers to do any straight lines or whatever you know where they are
michael jackson michael jackson music come on how long have you been in my class you should know what mj stands for
remember what you ve got to do to this song remember shoulders shoulders come on get them going you ve got to wake up go you ve got more wiggle than that go
you guys have got to be quiet wait a minute all right yes
okay if you need help or you get stuck or you re having trouble brainstorming raise your hand i ll do my best to help you out not you i m not allowed to help you
you i need help with storming brainstorming for just your world period well let s just pick a place imaginative like do you want to make up a completely new environment or do you want it to look more like a map of something you would recognize
0 realistic realistic okay well just start drawing a town and just start in the corner not too big and just think about these shapes and just think about what this could be so like what s something you could draw that would be in your town
cube a house a house okay so start somewhere in your little world and get you a cube house and that s all you do just slowly start marking stuff off of the list you ll get going okay what do you need
can we check it in like these little things 0 my goodness head if you re listening knows chin head nose toes eyes don t poke them ears head
okay i was just asked can we check them off in the little blanks no
off so you 0 i lost your eyeballs you use this little blank space right here and i would just do a little bitty checkmark or a little bitty dot next to it because like i said tomorrow when you label you re going to want to check it off again
copied so try to be original which means try to have own idea your own world way maybe you have like you guys are so much younger you might be feeling silly when i ask these questions but have you all seen the cartoon george jetson
okay you will put one of them on there don t know how to sing it anyway yeah i do
do that s what i said you know how to sing it anyway you can have little people in your world you can have animals people there are no have to not have to no rules like that
there have you named your world yet
there isn t actually a town yet i was thinking of building places with person that live there what s this shape cone and awesome 0 that s nice a nice cylinder what s this a circle is this going to be 3 d
is this like a 3 d cone with a scoop of ice cream in it
place like a made up land are yeah i m putting a little road in a basket of it will be the moon and it s going to be in space with a bunch of cars on it
space sydney space can these 2 keep on going do what
this the because yeah if you extended this out because the like this so that will work this is i love it
why because good jerodtopia i like it
me i m sorry i m not very scary that s so cute where did you get that someone got it for my birthday and it that s cool i don t know does it
okay what does intersecting mean yes yes because you ve got a straight line going this way and a straight line going that way yep
teacher what does this mean when they re perpendicular because it has like a because i thought it was like 2 it s just like having really fat lines but it doesn t matter how many right angles should you see this wait a minute 1234 yep
it it s got a scratch in it
there s a triangle right there . a rectangular prism yeah up can i use my math book yeah guys if you all need to use your math book to look up anything if you re forgetting something or getting confused totally use your resources check out your notes
this book no baby your math book does that count as a 01 i don t know what do you need for a rectangular prism i don t know do you see a rectangular prism here yes which one this one tell me about it
on she s on page 287 looking at the let s see your i think it s easier when you do it because i because 282 has the 3 d shapes too see i don t think this cd is going to make it guys they re all rectangles they all as rectangles and how many faces are there 2
there s 6 so do you have that down here this is the back of the bottom okay what s the roof what shape is the roof
a hexagon so let s see let s count the sides 12345 what shape is that that s a pentagon are there any pentagons faces in a rectangular prism
yeah and you could just use this one for different okay go on yep how would you make like a sideways rectangular prism what do you mean like the tissue box
like this sideways guys i m going to leave these the 3 d shapes we looked at when we did geometry i m going to leave those i ll put them over here by or by
so if you need to come grab one to look at it to think about how to draw it or whatever fell free a rectangular prism i don t have a rectangular one but think about a tissue box so do you want to do it this way you mean
and then you just connect the vertexes and vertices like that this a line what like this a line what is a line it has no endpoint and it goes on forever okay it is this a line
0 i 180 degrees it s 180 degrees so is this because that goes on in both directions forever is that a line help is this right here a line if it goes on in both directions forever not because it s 180 degrees it s got to be straight which is what 180 degrees means
straight yes and does it go on in both sides directions forever yes so is it a line
good that s good
thank you what s your world called kentopia kentopia nice what i like that i see on s is that he checking off his little shapes to the left when he gets them he s staying organized what are you making huh a beach
making a point a bunch of little points that s good mine is sisiland sisiland cute mine is sireland like ireland sireland like austria i like it
ew you have a good start girl tell me some things you ve got
window okay how is that a cube what is a cube 4 right angles it does have right angles what else there s 4 pair of parallel sides okay is a cube a 3 d figure or a 2 d figure is it flat just 2 d or is it something that you could hold that s something 3 d
282 actually but we don t have to look there it s got an awesome picture and a definition right there a solid figure with 6 congruent square faces 6 congruent square faces and you told me a cube was flat does that look flat or in 3 d to you okay so is this a cube it s not 3 d
square a square yeah i have a right here a prism
cube because rectangle is like wide and not so small and what about a rectangle is that it doesn t have 6 congruent well it does have 6 congruent sides but it has . congruent sides what s congruent mean
congruent means i don t know you don t know we have so many things to look up congruent my stomach is just mine is too
on we talked about that special the teacher appreciation lunch is today and i think my belly is just excited mexican food see right here congruent what s it say having the same size and shape okay the same size and shape here s a rectangular prism and you just said the faces are all congruent so is this face congruent to this one
no they re the same shape . but they re not the same size are . that was another thing do you remember congruent and . do you know the term i know what you re talking about but . there s congruent and . guys and i are discussing some one of the things we did on the flipbook
we talked about congruent which is 1st of all what is congruent same shape and same size what was the other thing where it might be the same shape but not the same size similar okay so it is a rectangular prism not because all the faces are congruent
prism it has a similar and it has you mean the faces are similar i mean there are rectangles and possibly squares . read this definition for a rectangular prism
a solid figure in which all 6 faces are rectangles so how many faces does this thing have 6 and what shape are they rectangles that s why it s a rectangular prism 0 they don t necessarily have to be the same size all right so you ve got that yes excellent what else do we have i have a cylinder good because it has 2 flat faces good
shape circles awesome and then i have little points up here okay and then i have a circle which is the cul de sac good flat excellent and 0 this is like a rectangle the door
yep and the windows are squares is that a square no that s a rectangle yeah now if you make them perfectly all the sides congruent are the same
it i don t know what to do next you ve got to be creative look how much more i did i don t need that much more good plan
you re on fast yeah awesome look at mine i made a you re being nice and neat all right show me your cube right there okay square square right there awesome what is that thing prism rectangular prism right there above the 0 the post cool cone the cone right there okay
right there where the that s the 0 i gotcha is he doing pull ups or something what s he doing pull ups chin ups some chin ups all right a sphere sphere the basketball the basketball a line a line right here cool
point i don t have you re going to do the top of that thing a line segment line segment here i don t okay
there s a bunch more because so we re going to call this thing the cylinder we have to stick some more line segments on there line segments what is a line segment like it has 2 endpoints come back to your seat what it has 2 endpoints like right here and here yep
do you see anything on your drawing you ve got like bunches of them and here check these out everyone single one of these because it just goes from one spot to another spot so you ve got tons
this okay so that you want to what the to the basketball is a little cone cone i ll need to turn this down a little bit the music s getting loud we re rocking out over here
22 what is a cone
how do you it on the paper a rectangular prism that s what i was doing on the board watch whichever way you want to make it stand
this and then you want to do another rectangle that s congruent to that so exactly the same shape and size but move it up a little bit like this and then connect the vertices so do like the bottom left to the bottom left just connect them up all right did you find it
yes 0 i thought we were talking about a cylinder not a cylinder it s a cone cone yeah right there 0 already talked about that little hat didn t we
angle acute angle and i have 2 obtuse okay show me your acute like trace it with your finger okay cool obtuse right there and right here awesome where and right here is this obtuse yeah 0 no it s not like straight good the lines need to be straight right angle right angle right here
perfect and it can be like right here 0 we ve got bunches of those and intersecting lines x 0 good parallel parallel right there there there perpendicular hold on one sec they re like like the okay
good circle circle right there triangle triangle where s it at it s somewhere 0 the little tops of the houses what part of the top of the house would be a triangle what is a triangle it has 3 sides yeah
it it has one i need you to find your seat lady it has one pair of you need to start coloring then you re not done
going it has one pair of parallel lines right there they re parallel they re never going to cross no pairs of parallel 0 is a triangle a flat thing or a 3 d thing
flat okay and my question is on the house do you have just a flat on board a triangle board no okay you need something flat pentagon the house all right back table
you all are about to cause us to have to turn the music off because i m hearing more playing than working and when i look back there i m seeing more talking than working together the house pentagon the house the outline is the house flat or 3 d flat houses are flat you live in a flat house
cool and hexagon right there where at sides how many sides do we need for a 123456
good we need to think about triangle and pentagon though okay did you still need me honey what s up ray a flashlight what do you mean talk to me
like this line across the universe and this line s going to be and i want to draw somebody with a flashlight okay would the flashlight like draw a little flashlight on here show me what you re talking about okay what part of that is a ray
it like where where you turn it on and the light goes off okay so the flashlight is not your ray but the light is correct yeah where it s because it s starting here and shooting off in one direction forever yeah
how are we doing little good toys r us yes i don t a name for this
done yeah 0 cute i can t think of a name hair you go i said hair you go i don t know you have power lines
too yes ladies look good all right where s your cube right here okay a square pyramid right there nice i m going to steal your list rectangular prism right here cone right here that s cute
side cylinder that s a cylinder right here there you go line a line is . all right great good girl cute line segment right wait that s like where it is there it s where there s one point in the where what
it s where there s a line has 2 end points good 2 short things and what is that thing seesaw okay it s a seesaw with like more than 2 people can get on it
gotcha i m done with like all of this all right hold on
i ll be over there in a minute 0 remix yeah this cd is birthday s tomorrow yeah that s exciting all right a ray right here right here good obtuse right there 0 awesome right okay and your intersecting intersecting that s perpendicular are perpendicular lines intersecting yes
why because they cross good so you could label it as both parallel parallel lines are right here good circle all right triangle right there that box yep a pentagon has how many sides
a pentagon has 5 okay 6 good let s count them 123456 good where s your pentagon then pentagon i don t remember where i put it
one everything else you have though okay all right lady are we going to have the coloring done today or we will be . is that the real time goodness gracious no maybe i ll tomorrow color them see will we be able to work on this in science class too no
because we re focus all right cube a cube cool square pyramid rectangular prism good cylinder right there sphere line
point right there okay line segment in the okay ray
acute angle and here okay
ones i have 0 yeah there are some good ones obtuse on that sign okay rectangle yeah friends time to put your we ll finish talking about this when we come back actually put your checklist and your paper somewhere safe
i recommend in a folder or you can slip it inside your math book so it doesn t get all bent up and put it in your desk when you are ready for lunchish munchish line up i bet teacher is i bet i am
i bet i m excited if you borrowed a rule please pick it up and put it back in the basket
all right line up when you re ready
perfect teacher did you make that one up there yes ma am okay see if you can line up in 1098 honey you should be in focus 76 i would like it if you would follow directions 5 it does look lovely though 43
b 21 get your hands ready you re colorful hands
you i m assuming you had some fun this morning it s stamps stamps are you okay
you fell somebody pushed me
thank you
okay class today we re going to continue our discussion from where we were yesterday
yesterday we read this book amanda bean s amazing dream who can tell me what was the main thing we learned from this c that multiplication is faster than counting we learned that multiplication is faster than counting numbers one by one
what else did we find out about multiplication what was something else we found out here we said that it was counting we said that it was grouping what else did we say yesterday about this
counting we got that something different than counting and grouping sharing sharing and grouping is a lot alike else split in different parts you can split it into different parts this what does it mean when i say how are we going to represent it
multiplication in an array in an array who can tell me what would be a very good definition of an array in your math journal this morning you were supposed to have written a definition definition who would like to share theirs share yours an array is a diagram of a multiplication problem a diagram what else did you say
an array is an equal row with columns wait an array is an equal diagram with rows and columns very good definition let s write that one up here you said i think this combines everything up here
now an array is an equal diagram with rows and columns equal rows and columns so you re saying here that an array cannot have unequal rows
good today what we re going to do is carry this one step further what i m going to do is tell you about something i found out that we re going to do today you are going to be employees of the hershey candy company yes so we re going to do a big pretend job we re going to pretend that we are employees of the hershey candy company
now the president has a real problem he has all of this candy and he doesn t know how to put it in boxes no he doesn t know what size boxes he needs to order for his candy he wants it to be in the best cost minded box
he wants it to be in the larger size if he needs a large size but he has special specifics about his candy he does not like candy that s not in one layer other so he s not going to have a box of candy that has multiple stacks
he only wants his box to have one flat layer today we re going to do a little investigation and we re going to explore something
now i need and i need and i need and i need to come here it you just take it and put it on your table and then i m going to tell you what we re going to do with our boxes
now the 1st thing you re going to notice is you have in your box you have some one inch squares
now the hershey you know what hershey candy looks like and it s usually in a bar but he has invented a new kind of candy and he says this is more cost effective and he does not understand how he is going to package it because he says it is too tedious to wrap each one of the little candy squares into an individual piece
so he s thinking that he could have the combination of sizes of boxes but he just doesn t know which size to buy
he s saying i ve got all of this candy and i ve got to figure out what size boxes now our task today is to be candy representatives and we re going to be designers and we re going to come up with the actual sizes of the boxes that mister candy now this is how we re going to do this in the big box you see you have some squares
candy these happen to be one inch squares so this makes it very nice because this is the actual size of the candy that the candy company needs now i have given you on your table there is a little cup in the box inside the cup in the box are numbers
do you re going to draw a number out each one of you will have a different number you re going to draw the number out and then on your sheet on your table you re going to get some of the squares out of the big box it doesn t matter what color they are it has nothing to do with it
color you re going to take those and arrange them on your table in a shape where it will go with an array that has equal columns and equal rows that everybody understand what you re going to do
the 2nd thing you re going to do after you ve gotten yours arranged some of these you ll be able to arrange them in squares some of them are going to have to be arranged in rectangles some of them can be arranged in rectangles and squares so you want to arrange them in as many ways as you can arrange that group of the number that you got
you there was a sampler that he gave us and the sampler has 4 pieces of candy in it now what kind of shape could we arrange ours everybody get 4 counters out of your pieces of candy in the bucket just 4 middle i m going to get you some candy
on now you take the 4 that you have gotten and let s arrange those into the shape on your paper desk put them in a shape that s either going to be a rectangle or it s going to be a square good now you have a what
what 2 by 2 here this is what i m seeing on some people s plates correct yes this is an array equal numbers and equal squares together so you have 2 here
here we say this is a 2 by 2 now the multiplication sign there is by 2 now did somebody else do one that s different than this one c i did it like this you did a what yours one by 4
one by 4 it s one here and 4 going this way 4 are there any other ways that you can arrange that one no so he s going to use 4 pieces of candy in his sampler box what kind of boxes must he have to use this as a sampler
p rectangle or square he can have a rectangular box and this would be his rectangular box here or he could have a square box here kinds this is your task that you ve got to do
on your paper right now i want you to take your 4 squares off of your paper lay them over on the side and then i want you to draw the exact thing that you have here using the squares on your paper so you need to draw a 2 by 2 on your paper outline it
now 2 by 2 and draw a one by 4 yes do we use the little squares you use the squares these are one 2 3 4 individual each one of the squares is representative class of this each of the little half inch squares here are one of these
it you need to draw both and label it okay it i m going to share this with you in just go around the outside edges of them and then it will show 2 by 2 or one by 4
good look at s see how nicely he s done this t you re going to use your colored pencil wait a minute until i tell you all of the directions
this then what you re going to do is after you get these drawn this is going to be for the number what 4 will you draw a number out of your cup here
11 now his number is 11 next you re going to do just like you did the 4 by 4 and you re going to see how many ways you can make 11 and you re going to outline it and do it understand in this cup are 36 numbers out the 4 is not in here because we did the 4
what i want you to do is use your paper there and then as a group this is what we re going to do as a group when you get through doing all of these and we have time you re going to get a sheet of paper over here or i m going to put it up on the board one of the 2 and what i want you to do is you re going to show all of your numbers
out you re going to cut them out and show them on here numbers nobody else will have your number except the number 4 4 but nobody else will have for example 36
do now i would like for you to outline that with a colored pencil so when we glue it on here it will show up nice and then what we re going to do is glue these on here and we re going to make a grid where this grid will show all 36 numbers
at the top we ll put group one group 2 group 3 group 4 and we ll put our numbers up here then you will show these in order like one 2 3 4 down to show how you have fixed them question now what are we making out of these numbers arrays and what does an array have to have
what rows and equal columns you know every time we go out of the building we see an array can anybody look around the room and find an array really quick there right there there s another one where the walls the walls are an array
side how about our words up here would that be an array 12 there s more than that 34 yes
yes calendar calendar the 100s chart how about our what do we call them themes
yes how about our levels of behavior up there the ones on the board would be our 7 habits
no yes yes do you see something else boxes what else the big 20 class data lines dividing the small squares the graph okay busy the 1st thing you need to do is 1st of all we re going to ask a few questions in a few minutes
you re going to have to the president wants you to make a report at the end and he wants you to report on how many boxes he s going to need that s going to be rectangular how many boxes he s going to need that s going to be square then i m going to give you an amount you have to have so the 1st thing you re going to do is draw a number from the cup
you pass the cup around and just draw a number and i want you to get busy working
one which one get busy use these you have to form it class before you can draw it yes no your number is 11 so what numbers multiplied together will give you 11
one times 11 paper you have to form it before you can do it on boys on sit down on your hiney what have you got
it come on go all right everybody working busy you ve got to form it with the things before you draw it it what s your number
9 you have to think 1st of all what could you do with 9 other than one times 9 groups can you put those in even groups see let s see
boys level out how do i add for a prime number tell me what s your number 29 so can you make anything
29 no so what are you going to have to do you have either 29 here you might have to take 2 and put them together end to end cut them you have to decide
one all right let s talk about on our sheets some people are running into this carefully you re going to use these half inch squares
if there s not like 29 going down and you want to say one times 29 then you re going to have to use 2 columns and you re going to cut them out and then you re going to glue them end to end where it will be one long strip go you have to form it before you can color it
on let s see what you ve got right if you need another sheet of paper there s paper over here on the counter now you ve got plenty of room on your paper to work okay how else can you take these
12 now you take those and put them in equal rows and see what you come up with
got 14 by 2 on 2 by 16 and it equals you can you can do it as many ways as you can prove it on your paper
it is it going to look different right what do you have
here see how many ways you can fix them where they have equal rows and equal there is there anything multiplied together that will give you 13 clue so one times 13 is
paper class we need to work good be sure that you make it before you draw it and you use the lines to draw 7 you have to write on there one by 7
can you do one by 6 and 6 by one okay that s the number you use until you have done them all
number excuse me carefully some of you have finished with your 1st one bucket do not put the number you did back into the bucket
do not cut until after we get ready to paste okay you write on there how many you re going to need and then we can paste it okay thing do we have to do half it if equals the number
get what s going to give you 33 3 one times 33 33 that would give you a totally different look and be long and narrow and thin
that s where you re going to have to have is this 33 here you have to have use 2 boxes and add some to it
okay is there anything else that would equal 27 is there any other way you can put these together 3 you re fine 11 3 of those would be how many
11 if you made 3 11 things here and you cut them out and put them end to end you d have what 33 you could do that
9 that was my 2nd number because it was odd yes can i pick another one what do i do if i already did it do i draw it time some of you are having difficulty with your drawing on your paper
directions when you have everybody look up here board when you have a piece of graph paper how many little squares are there across on that graph paper 14 no it s more than that 16 all right you have your graph paper here
here it s divided into rows this way here if this is one 2 3 4 5 and i want to get to the 11 then i could use i could cut out this row right here
then i could cut out the row next to it right here and i can glue it right down here and then i can glue one more piece right here 11 now some of these are long numbers like 29 you re going to have to take several rows and put them together if you re doing one by 29
you understand that s what you have to do paper so i m going to come around and put a piece of paper now on your table boys you can start by gluing on your piece of paper
once you have finished yours you might have to put it on the table or on the floor one good job i hope you re learning some interesting things about your numbers
work here s a piece of paper girls you ve got yours here it here s a piece of paper what how would you build 31
need i don t understand how you can get 33 by one you said this was how many 11 how many is this this is 11 this is 11 and this is 11
right if you wanted to make it one times 33 then you would take each one of these and put them together the long way 33 no because that would only be 16
20 so if you cut this out here and you cut 3 rows of 11 out and you turn them together would you have 33 yes cut out 3 rows and let s see
number start right here pass the cup do some people s will only let them do one number darling i said there are more papers down on the counter
piece everybody s putting theirs on there on you just put what number is it out beside it now i asked that you outline that where it will show up on the paper so be sure that you ve outlined it okay i had a good question and i need to hear an answer to my question
someone said i have done 4 meaning they have done 4 of the same number they only had one number but they did 4 drawings someone else said i have a number and i ve only done one what s the difference in the person who s done 4 and the person who s done one
what it s prime the number more than likely is prime if they ve done more than one prime yes no no why 11 times 3 is 33 so it s not prime
so think about it if you have a combination of numbers what are you doing done this is 3 times 4 is 12 4 you need to write it with your black crayon it s 3 down so that goes 1st
see you just pick a number out
working i see some people looking around when you re gluing yours be sure that you re gluing yours you need to put on here one by what
29 they need to be glued together if it s going to be one piece there move it down because one piece is no longer 29 little pieces piece glue it on straight and write one times 29
okay you need to be working sweetheart what are you doing you don t need to be laying them that way lay them down flat
you you can cut them out and put them together let me make a suggestion i want to make a suggestion let s not do one times every number unless that s the only thing you can do because you know that every number times itself is itself right
itself some numbers have no other arrays for them other than one times that so if you have one that has like 36 has more than one array don t just do the one with one times 36 do you can t use that can you
do you re going to have to make one long line together he s cut them and glued them together to make one times 29 what it s just 11 times one
good okay we re fixing to have to come up with some ideas for the president in just a few short minutes
darling you can t have this here 2 by what 2 you can t have 31 times 2 bucket so what are you trying to make
16 how many more are you going to need you don t need 21s with them you re going to cut it out because it s not a 2 by something cut how much is one strip
16 i don t know count it and see 14 you need to count this strip right here what is this strip right here 14 have you counted that
16 you can use it 31 16 and 16 is not 31
one so cut off one and glue them together end to end on you all are wasting too much time on stuff come on
cup you better hurry working they ve got things on their paper
row get your passport darling yes now if you put these end to end darling what will you have if you glue these down end to end what would you have
31 and this would be one by what 31 so it s one by 31 get so glue it down good what you got
29 is going to be a long piece right 29 you need to cut those out and glue them on the sheet those don t need to have the little triggers on the side 33 is 3 by 11
do you understand how you got that one by 33 boys you need to start gluing yours on the mat here so we can look at yours sweetheart you don t need that much glue on something else times that will give you 36
on what was 17 times 2
34 have you got yours you need to cut yours out and glue them on the poster sweetheart they ve got to be straight
that ms 2 so do i put those i would get another piece of paper and do 9 by 2
9 right there is your 9 by 2 2 by 9 hurry we need your help
out what have you got 12 ms a do we cut them out yes
doing you should be about through with your cutting and your drawing got sweetheart what are you doing 29 you need to write on here one by 29
number you haven t drawn one here s one right here do this one do that one
get your 25 and make a square what it s going to be 25 8 girls just get one please pick up one
it s all you need to do
on put them on there now put that one there now how many do you have 5 4 times 5 is what
20 4 times 5 is 20 so you have one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 need okay now draw your 5
now how many do you have what is this down 5 by 5 good now draw it on here 5 down and 5 across need how many are we supposed to do
do you ve got a 3 by 6 2 by 9 2 you need to cut these out and glue them on your paper
here okay class give me 5 chair we re going to stop right there and listen now
down now looking at what you have done what would be your report to the president of the hershey company would you report you re going to need more rectangular boxes more square boxes
of looking at your boxes that you have on your chart this table over here has lots of things on their chart here are you going to need a lot of rectangular or more square boxes squares there s only one square there
how many of the rest of them they re all rectangles no on this one you all are going to need more rectangular boxes you re supposed to lay them on here like this darling cut the whole line out you re going to need more squares
rectangles they are rectangles of all of those are rectangles except one you ve got a square there what does it tell you can you have a seat
listen as you walk around the room i see that most of you in here the numbers that we have had time to do that they have leant themselves more to rectangular boxes what does this tell you about not having so many squares
numbers there s possibly but then we have what square 4 equal sides makes a square we have very few of these numbers that are going to make a square
this is how sometimes when we are thinking about moving things which things are going to take up more room in a room if this is furniture that you have on your little table here would these long rectangular pieces take up more room or would the square pieces take up more room
well it s according to what you want you room to look like right good okay so what have we learned today about our numbers and our arrays what have you learned about the numbers in your arrays some of them are even and some of them are odd
when you were doing an even number did you have more arrays yes if you were doing an odd number you did not have as many sometimes though some of the odd numbers are not prime some of the odd numbers that we have are composite okay good you all did a very good job
out the 1st model we talked about yesterday was the area model please i need you in your seat
go to your seat please do not argue with me and go to your seat so number one you had 45 times 61 who can come up to the board and use the area model for 45 times 61
did anyone else use the area model for 45 times 61
yes is doing it
on your paper on a sheet of loose leaf if you did not use the area model i want you to try using the area model for 45 times 61 yesterday if you already used the area model then you need to be checking your work
those of you who are just coming in take out your math notebook and your math homework
quickly okay so explain to the class you answer and what you did i multiplied one times 60 i am just going to write the problem up here so it was 45 times 61
okay so where did you get the 40 from times 60 and got because the 40 is coming from what place value 10s so if i have 10 4s that is how much 40
40 times i multiplied 40 times one and got 40
i got the one and the 40 i multiplied 60 times 5 and got 300
it all she did for the area model is when you have large numbers like this you break them down into smaller pieces or smaller parts these answers in here are the partial products and you take the partial products and you add them all up to get your product of 45 times 61
2745 number 2 was to multiply 56 times 24
let us review the expanded notation
i am going to stop you for 12nd remember yesterday when i wrote over here it was 50 +6 this is the expanded form
4 so then i asked you to make sure when you have your parenthesis to make sure we are multiplying them all let us not forget that step you have 50 times 20 which you got right there and then you have 50 times 4 and 20 times 6
no
them i said it would be parentheses with an x in the middle so which one do you have left
now i need to line them up
1404 give a thumbs up if you agree that the answer is 1404 agreeing okay let us look
0 +0 +0 +4 is 4 10 you put your 0 i see where i messed up up times 20 so 20 times 6 is very good
answer yes even if you did it a different method you did not have to do it this way 1344 we are going to do one more i want you to do number 3 which was 83 times 27
who can do 83 times 27 using the lattice method
doing
put it down thanks there you go
that is fine you can do it either side 2241 correct now explain what you did with the class
i did 8 times 2 which is 16 then i came down here and did 7 times 8 which is 56
then i come over here and did 8 times 2 which is 16 and they do not have a 10s place so there is just a 0 and 6 is in the ones place then i did 7 times 3 which is 21 and then add them up one and then 6 +6 which is 12 12 +2 equals 14 12 then one +one equals 2 and i got my answer so 2241
differently did you catch your mistake no did you catch your mistake did you do it the lattice method you did it a different way okay did anyone do it the lattice method one no
so raise your hand though if you got the same answer 2241 okay so if you did it a different way and got the same answer we know when we checked it that it is also correct
answer so we are going to take a few of the same methods and we are going to use them to multiply 3 digit numbers
okay when you get this put your name on it table make sure gets one and make sure your name and your number is on your homework from last night
it if you have more than one paper for your homework that is fine just make sure your name is on every piece and i will staple them together
problem we are going to use the area model i will wait until our mouths are closed because i will not talk over you the very 1st one we are going to try is 343 times 275 now we are multiplying 3 digits by 3 digits place yesterday we had the ones and the 10s
now this time we have what place the 100s the 100s place 275 when we do the area model it helps because you are breaking down the numbers
so the 3 we broke down our rectangular shape m because the 3 is in the 100s place
the 3 is in the 100s place so i take 300 plus where is the 40 coming from 40 place there is a 4 in the 10s place which means 10 4s that is a 40 and i have got 31s
if i add 300 +40 +3 i get 343 here 200 the 2 is in the what place 2 would be in the this 2 is in what place the 100s place
the 100s place so if i have a 2 in the 100s place this 2 equals how much 200 the 7 is in what place the 10s place so if i have a 7 in the 10s place that is worth how much ones so in the 1st box we are going to multiply you are going to do this on your paper
i am going to multiply 300 times 200 anytime i multiply with zeros i just add those zeros on 6 6 okay have how many zeros do i have
4 so i am going to add 4 zeros one 2 3 4 so 300 times 200 equals how much 60000 in the 2nd box i am going to take 200 times 40
2 times 4 is how much 3 so what is 200 times 40
8000 then i am going to take 200 times 3 i am taking the 100s now times the 3 which is in the ones place and we know that 2 times 3 is how much 6 6 and how many zeros do i have 2 so 200 times 3 equals how much
600 now i am going to do the same thing with my 70 i am going to multiply what is in my 100s place to the number that was in the 10s place so 300 times 70 21 okay
3 add on 3 zeros one 2 3 comma so what is 300 times 70 21000 good 10s so i am going to have 70 times 40
28 how many zeros do i have 2 add on 2 zeros 2800 now i am going to take the number that is in the 10s place which is 70 or 7 and multiply it by the 3 which is in the ones place
what is 7 times 3 add so 70 times 3 equals 210 step
5 so i am going to take 300 times 5 15 how many zeros do i have 2 so what is 300 times 5 1500 my next step who can tell me what the next step is
40 times 5 20 how many zeros am i going to add one so what is 40 times 5 200 then the last step
3 and what is 5 times 3 15 so i broke down the large numbers into smaller numbers and we got our partial products what do i do with these partial products
up i am going to take 60000 you so i have 60000 i am just going to go straight across
i ran out of room i want you to add them up at your seats m 12nd give everyone a chance to add them up
easier i am actually going to come over here and write the answer because i did not start it high enough up ones all those zeros +5 gives me how much no 5 now the 10s
all the zeros +one gives me i thought it was one +one at all these zeros in the 10s column
here one 2 3 4 5 zeros is how much +one plus another 100s 6 +8 gives me how much
14 what is 14 +2 16 what is 16 +5 i know that 16 +4 gives me 20 plus another one would be 21
23 so i am going to put my 3 carry your 2 10 10 +one
13 13 +one 2 one +6 is 7 7 +2 is 94325
so 343 times 275 gives us 94325 up if you did not get that did you see where you you got a 0 okay
up no up where did you get 200 and okay you do not have them all lined up correctly see how i have mine written up there
that one +8 is 9 correctly now in your notebook i want you to try another problem using this same method
so on a sheet of paper in your notebook turn to a clean sheet of paper i want you to try 152 times 178
model you are taking those big numbers and you are just making them smaller expanding them k i will be right over
so you need to be trying this in your notebook i want you to when you open up to a clean page at the top of your paper i want you to write your heading 3 digits by 3 digits or if you wrote multiplying 3 digits by 3 digits and then label
put number one area model so you know which model that you chose and then go ahead and multiply 152 times 178 use your example if you need to that we just used so you have something to look back on
60000 what is 8 +5 10 i know 5 +6 is 11 21 what is 8 +5 13 13 +6
21 you have to line them up like this in a row 13 13 +6 is how much
19 6 +2 is 8 8 +8 is 16 and what is 16 +5
21 okay put your 2
8 where did you get this came from here 600 wait 6 +8 is 14
16 16 +5 is 21 23 you need to erase all this and make sure they are lined up correctly
that i will get you an eraser you eraser just fell off
now add them give me a thumbs up if you are finished
okay who can come up and use the area model to multiply 152 times 178
it
leave it there are you going to be able to fit your work in there
all can you explain to us as you are doing it what you are doing
because the one in 178 okay does it matter what number i have on the top or the bottom no
no it does not add then 100s and the 1000s good 100 times 7 is i am sorry 700 10 times 80 i mean 100 times 8 is 800
i am going to stop you right there give her a thumbs up if you agree with her 1st row so far and you have the same answers
page we know that 100 times 100 equals 10000 yes i have a question i did the same thing but my 152 was up top that does not matter that is okay it does not matter because when you multiply does it matter if i multiply 5 times 2 which is 10 or 2 times 5 which gives me 10
no it does not matter okay so raise your hand or give me a thumbs up if you got the same answer so far for the top 3 boxes or if you multiplied 100 times 100 which is 10000 you are the only one that is using a calculator and i did not ask you to use a calculator
140 8 times good
erasing so you did find it wrong i do not know how to do it 70 what is 100 times 7 put your 7 and put your zeros how many zeros go but i do not know what to do
okay you are going to take all these numbers your partial products and you add them all up now
yeah you take 100 times 100 and 100 times 50
top so what is 100 times 50 what is one times 5
5 see how this answer is in a different box than hers because your other numbers were in differently okay so 100 times 8 gives us there should be 100 times 2
2 okay give her a thumbs up if you got that answer let us look i did not get that answer so a few of us are not getting the same answer if you did 152 on top your numbers are just in a different box so they are going to be in a different order
check 100 times 100 gives us 10000 so is that box correct yes wait 12nd is 100 times 100 10000 yes so that box is correct 7000 yes so that box is correct
correct you might not have that box with those answers in it because you wrote the 152 on top which is fine 800 is 100 times 8 800
5000 yes is 100 times 50 5000 okay is 70 times 50 3500 yes no sorry yes is 50 times 8 400
yes is 100 times 2 200 yes is 70 times 2 140 yes so the last box 8 times 2 we know is 16 so you take those partial products and you add them up everyone is good with their numbers being correct in the boxes
yes we just checked it so your box numbers should be right it is wrong so all of our zeros +6 gives us 6 5 what is 8 +5
8 +5 13 17 i forgot i got a different one what did you do wrong forgot the 200
there go ahead so we caught her mistake which is fine mistakes i need you to sit
sit what is 5 +8 13 13 +4 is
20 okay 2 now give her a thumbs up if you got the same answer now what was your question
m 4000 but 5 times 8 is 40 one you added an extra 0
all right the word problem for this morning
some of you got it some of you didn t if the train runs from norfolk to richmond 3 times a day 3 times a day a total of 193 passengers ride on the train if the train runs for 48 days i want to know how many people will ride the train
this is a multi step problem the 1st thing you needed to find out is how many people ride the train in one day how can i find out how many people ride the train in one day multiply honey i already started i mean times 193
193 people ride the train right how many times a day does the train run times you ve got to multiply 193 times 3 to find out how many people ride it in one day 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 9 is 27 3 times one is 3 +2 more is 5
so in one day okay 579 people ride the train in one day step have i answered the question that was asked no every time you work a word problem go back to the question you were asked and ask yourself have i answered that question yet if the answer is no then you know you ve got another step
now that i know that there s 579 people in one day how many days did this train run 48 so i need to multiply 579 times 48 wrong you need to be able to look at that problem and realize this is a multiplication problem
if you added you need to ask yourself what were you thinking 8 times 9 is what 8 times 9 is 8 times 10 is what 80 8 times 10 is 80 so what s 80 -8
what s 80 -8 80 -8 is 72 72 so if 8 times 10 is 80 and i want to know what 8 times 9 is i can do 80 -8 is 72 so 8 times 9 must be 72
8 times 7 is 56 but i ve got to add the 7 that i carried 7 63 you guys are asleep this morning up 8 times 5 is 40 +6 is what
46 i ve used the 8 thing this time i m using that pretty little 4 4 times 9 is what people 4 times 9 is what
36 4 times 7 is what 28 but i ve got 3 up here i ve got to add to it so it s 31 4 times 5 is 20 +3 is 23
27792 you ve got to do it before i start son multi step any part of that that anybody had any trouble with
m do you see your mistake you understand what you did wrong yeah does that help you so the next time i ask you a word problem you might understand it a bit better did i look at your paper yes and you said no
paper it s in the trash can go get it you where s your paper in the trash get it out all right while they re getting it out because if i looked at it and i saw it wrong i ll correct it me go get it
i looked at that answer go get your candy honey i m sorry about that math i updated calendar math for the weekend you should have done the same then you had to do today s
talking you should have updated yours for the weekend then you had to do today s
please take a seat you re up 1st
doing what do you call that particular shape line because there are 2 dots that tell us to stop does anybody know what we call those 2 dots points this is a line segment because it has 2 dots or what we in the math world would call end points that tells you stop
unlike yesterday s was a line because it had arrows on both ends right who s my next volunteer december it is day 68
i haven t written that up on the board yet but trust me it s day 68 send it s not a very smart board is it
it appears today s going to be one of those dumb board days 2 okay
is there a problem just leave it be
be honey i don t know what you re hitting but you ve got to stop hitting that you can t hit 2 or 3 things at the same time
it confuses my smart board okay you okay
17 how much money am i going to add to my depositor today math how did you get there
okay let s save it in case our board has another brain blip next got the good sheet
not necessary but thank you so very much how many centimeters are in a decimeter 10 how many decimeters are in one meter
10 which is bigger a centimeter or a decimeter a decimeter it must be bigger because you need 10 centimeters to make one decimeter
so today we have 170 something we have 170 do you have 170 decimeters up there somebody has not been paying attention to when we ve been doing calendar math
i have 170 centimeters have 17 decimeters
have show me your meters as a fraction i have one.7 meters but that s not a fraction decimal show me your meters as a fraction
box how many decimeters does it take to make one meter be how many decimeters do i have
17 17 so that would be my numerator but that s called what it somebody hasn t been paying attention
how many times can 10 go into 17 without going over one time right how many pieces do you have leftover 10
leftover one and 7 what how many does it take to make one whole you need to start paying attention sweetheart we ve been doing this for 17 days your denominator is going to be the same as in your improper fraction
bell your denominator in your mixed number is going to be 10 7 so that s your numerator right i keep telling you guys when you come to this board i know who s been paying attention and who hasn t after 17 days we shouldn t be having any trouble here
are you at home in bed
way each day we add 15th put that down
reason every day we add 15th to our circle because this month we re talking about numbers that can be divided by 5
what numbers can go into 68 2 because it s an even number
4 because divided by 4 equals do the math up there you have the big box
number it s 68 babe go slow
times how do i know 5 can t go into 68 c because 5 can only go into numbers that end in a 5 or a 0
l today s day 68 ways it takes 100 pennies to make one whole dollar
no so you re going to put a 0 in front of that decimal and because it takes 100 to make one whole i have to have a number in the tenths place and the hundredths place n not necessary
me honey erase what is there pen how much money do you have today ¢68
down now pick what you re going to buy
buy okay honey pick something we re buying some candy for ¢7 some gum for ¢16 and a ball for ¢10 honey we don t have to buy the whole store
no okay
decimals i m begging you you ve got to remember to do that if you don t line up your decimals when you re adding and subtracting and that decimal is in the wrong place it will change the number wrong so he spent ¢33
there quiet please
you should be checking to see if you have this right on your calendar math how much change am i going to get cents can you show me ¢35 in coins please
he has a quarter and a dime and that would equal ¢35 up you guys have got the giggles today over we started at 12 0
minutes you need to know that there are 60 minutes in one hour one 8 that was painful
all right true you are getting better getting better you need to remember you re supposed to be doing your calendar math on your sheet attention next time i could call on you and you don t want to be embarrassed when you come up here and you have no idea what you are doing
not you re on my time i know some of you were at 1st in math this morning not did you get your piece of candy sweetie yes
okay i would like to say we can take rounding off our daily review but sadly we are not i had another student who rounded last week s math problem perfectly then left off the last 3 zeros instead of 3500000 you have 3500
matter i ve warned you and warned you you cannot leave off the zeros number you ve got to remember 0 is a number it has an impact on your problem number all right
city they sent out 1634122 invitations i want you to round the number of invitations to the nearest 1000000s position place which one
one the 1st one some of you are still refusing to use your strategy if you don t use your strategy i will refuse to give you partial credit one what number is going to tell the one what to do
it there s nothing in front of the underlined number 2 there is a comma after that
j everything after what you underlined becomes a 0 because when i said round it to the 1000000s place i rounded up
2000000 if you forget even one of those zeros let s say i forgot that 0 if i forget that 0 i just changed that number to 200000
no so you cannot forget the zeros and as you get into those larger numbers it s easier to do that but you re in 4th grade now so you ve got to step up your game
okay there are 433 students in 5th grade 394 students in 4th grade and 683 students in grades one 3 some of you refuse to notice those special little words right there
i ve got to tell you on every word problem i see i m hoping it s an estimation problem because then i m dealing with zeros and some of you are refusing to recognize those beautiful little words there so there are 433 students in 5th grade 394 in 4th and 683 in one 3
doing am i adding subtracting multiplying or dividing point adding the other mistake i keep seeing you guys make is you are not finding the highest place value that they have in common you re doing everything perfectly but then not rounding all the numbers to the same place value
even if you think you know what it is write them like this so you can visually see 100s please i beg of you underline the highest place value they have in common arrows 3 tells the 4 to stay the same 9 tells the 3 to go up
8 tells the 6 to go up zeros that s why i don t understand why some of you are ignoring the fact that it s estimation
question 683 students in grades one 3 not in each grade 0 one 3 means one through 3 together not each grade okay
careful so then we add these 7 +4 is 11 +4 more is how many 15 you all are scaring me have 1500 or we can say that as 1500
thing any time you see something like this one 3 it s one 3 together okay sue bakes 36 cookies a day for 3 days 36 a day for 3 days sue joe baked 45 cookies a day for 4 days
information you go back and ask yourself what do i want to know i want to know how many cookies did they bake in all they meaning both of them so how many cookies did sue bake
a multiply 36 times 3 3 times 6 is 18 3 times 3 is 9 +one is 10 so i ll write it up here since the board decided to erase everything on me
108 go back to my question 4 why because that s how much joe baked 45 and you said 54 times 4
around you re doing the math perfectly except you re not using the same numbers 45 times 4 4 times 5 is 20 4 times 4 is 16 +2 is 18 180 have i answered my question yet no what do i need to do now
36 times 3 i ve already done 36 times 3 honey i mean you need to add them up add what up why because how many did they bake in all
multiplication i had to do multiplication math for joe but now i m going to do addition a word problem that s got addition and multiplication the horror of it all no absotively 0 +8 is 8 one +one is 2 so how many did they bake in all
288 that is a multi step problem if you go back to the question each time did i answer the question until i say yes i have the answer to the question you re not done easy you just have to make sure you did all the steps okay number 4 i have this is a good one
i have 3 cases of pencils and 4 boxes there are 46 boxes in each case and i want to know how many boxes i have have what s the 1st thing that i might do
3 right if i pull out i have cases okay finish pull out what you have
on i have a feeling this smart board is really going to give us trouble today today the 1st thing i want you guys to notice are you dealing with the same unit of measurement in this problem
with boxes and cases i m dealing with boxes and cases can i do the math with 2 different units of measurement no my question is how many what do i have
boxes so i want everything to be in boxes right now everything reappears boxes i have 3 cases and i have 4 boxes here i want to know how many boxes
do who said i don t get that i don t get it boxes no
k because do you know how many boxes are in one case 46 i know that 46 boxes are in one case
3 so can i determine how many boxes are in 3 cases yes by doing what multiply multiply what 46 times 3 cases 46 boxes are in one case
cases so 3 cases equals 138 boxes no i have to add the 138 boxes to the 4 boxes i already knew i had
12 so i have 142 boxes harder i could have told you there are 12 pencils in each box
step what i wanted you to see here and some of you need to wake up or i m going to give you a test today desk you need to wake up
asleep if you don t have this on your daily review and i know most of you don t because you were in 1st in math what should you be doing right now review sit
v i ve told you that every single day for 68 days pencil if you think i m playing you re wrong i get it you re excited christmas is coming but you have a test this week and you need to pay attention for it the last question
what expression will make this equation true it this is all information you ve already been taught now this is all information you have already been taught and you re sitting here acting like you have no idea what s going on after lunch today you re going to have a quick quiz pop quiz
you re going to participate in my class you re going to pay attention in my class lunch what expression will make this true 7 before i even do that math i m going to start throwing things out 46 +7 i know that s not going to be the same because it s multiplication versus addition
so figure out 46 -7 again we re going to deal with multiplication and subtraction out that leaves me 2 options do the math 7 7 times 6 is 42 28 so that s 322 which one up there if i did the math equals 322
3 i m sorry i told you to get up and write on the board together because everyone else i ve called on this morning has gotten out of their seat and written on the board with me right
time 300 +22 equals 322 but don t just pick it and move on because you can make it i have a sign on the board that says videotaping but they just come in 53 what s 53 -9
44 44 doesn t equal 322 does it no now i m very confident 322 is my answer please check all of your choices when we talk about these equations some of you are making careless mistakes close your books
can you run down to the teacher s lounge and tell her we re done for now us please take your pencils who s my line leader today you re line leader
alphabetical order i m sorry and that you re lining up and having a conversation at the same time line up please a b c order there she s not in the teacher s lounge then she s going to videotape us walking out of the room
please i thought we weren t pulling groups this week one 2 no sit
okay i m asking you to stop group if comes back she ll join your group all right
division i m going to have on the board the 3 different methods that you can work a division problem should you need it i m going to come by and on one board i m going to write a division problem
unfortunately somebody borrowed my black dry eraser yesterday from the corner and did not return it no does somebody have a dry erase marker that can borrow since all of mine have been taken
right now my focus is whether or not you can do the division
decision everybody will have an opportunity stop you do not all have the same problems
sit down j sorry you need to explain it to your team members team members you need to see if you can solve it because your captain might need help and you need to be prepared if you re struggling you need to raise your hand
around pay attention
has your captain explained anything to you yet no you need to be explaining to them what you re doing as you do it you need to explain to them what you re doing way you need to explain to them put your board down over here
doing do you guys get it
class erase your board please were you the last team leader or were you the last team leader it because i was doing it while she explained it him he still has to be the one to explain it
guys the person listen up please the person i wrote the problem for while the rest of you might be working the problem the person that has to explain how the problem is to be worked is the person i wrote the problem 1st has to explain 1st
1st since you explained the 1st one you explain this one next you can all work it but is going to explain it because if he can explain to you what he did then he understands division right
you i explained it to and he told everyone else no no because i asked him for help did no you said what told you to do me listen funny the person that i give the problem to i want you to explain it
not to put you on the spot but if you can explain what you did to another person then you will understand division right if you cannot explain it that tells me you do not understand division up let s see
yes really what did you get c then it s not that easy i ll be right there one explain do them what you did
you guys need to listen because he used a different method than you did how did you guys do friend 0 you re in charge
she got stuck explain what you did and pay attention to see what did he do that s different than what you did
now how many times does 3 go into 6 and it s 2 and it s exactly 2 times -6 equals 0 bring down the 8 then 3 goes into 8 2 times
then it goes into 6 2 times then but that s not the exact answer that one is that equals 2 down to 5 and 3 doesn t go into 25 exactly it goes into 24
how many times you have a 6 here careful look what you did here
9 then you did 6 -9 and got 2 but you turned it around 9 -6 right the fact that you got 9 here and you were trying to get 6 is your 1st clue you made a mistake you ve got to watch that 6 times 4 6 i was dealing with 3
6 times 4 is 24 but you re dealing with 3 not 4 okay you ready to try another one board this is why the sock is much quicker
problem let me see if i agree you don t agree it 4 goes into 5 how many times 4 goes into 18 4 times it does 4 times 4 is what 16
16 4 goes into 18 4 times and that gives you 16 2 pieces leftover think of division like a game you want to get as close as you can to that number without going over
4 so when you say 4 can t go into 18 evenly that s probably the mistake you re making 4 doesn t go into 18 at all does it here 4 times 4 is 16 then she had 2 leftover then she brought down her other 4
now because you re trying to say 4 can go into 18 and you re absolutely right but remember in division i want to go as close as i can without going over so i got it right hand they think i m doing it wrong because let s see
did can 5 go into 9 2 times no 5 can only go into 9 one time because 2 times 5 is 10
did you did this but then you didn t follow up up here you could do this what you did was you put 100 in each one of those right 100 i put 100 in each one of them then 100 times 5 that s 500 there then you have 484 left you put how much in each box
50 but you only subtracted 150 50 is 250 isn t it one 5 times 50 is 250 not 150
so if you do this method you can do this method but you have to be careful and what you put up here is the 1st time you put 100 in each one and the 2nd time i put 50 in each one am i right then you subtract 3 234 i can t put 50 in each one again because i don t have enough let s just look at this one
attention i put 100 in each one and 50 in each one right i now have 234 leftover
why don t i put 10 in each one down 13 -5 is what 8 i have 84 now
more i m going to add another 10 and that s 50 i m going to take out again 34 how much do you want to put in now 5 what s 5 times 5 25 now you have 9 left
i m going to put one in each one right anymore 100 +50 is 150 60 70 75 76 176 remainder 4
you have to be careful very very careful turn you ready you got to get this you re pressing down too hard and that s why you re destroying the tips of these markers because you re pressing down
that you ruined that marker work watch i don t need to press down on it
one you can use your method again but they all want to use a different method see if you can do it their way here your turn
you you can do that i want her to try her i need you to sit down and start working
hang on a minute the person who s supposed to be leading this group is not here you will one of you guys do you have a marker she can borrow marker you re the leader this time
you need to lead this group if it s trash it needs to be in the trash can you guys are up walking around around you should be working on this problem you are leading this group
you have a team mate who is now stuck you need to explain to her what you re doing and see if you can get her unstuck you should not be out of your seat right now you have a team mate who s supposed to be explaining what you re doing and you re not paying attention one let s see if you can do this one
group everybody up we re going to start at the beginning again process is the same
day how you guys doing see perfect okay
board unacceptable this isn t play time
okay i m going to give you guys a challenging one mates how you guys doing
we re doing good one times 5 2 3 times 8 5 goes into 28 you didn t put your number up here how many times did 5 go into 28 division without going over how many times
what 5 times 5 is what 0 25 25 goes there next step now you re going to bring down your 2 right 32 as close as you can get without going over
6 6 times 30 can you go over 5 more times where does the 6 go
30 if i m doing 6 times 50 2 you have nothing left to bring down mates how you guys doing over here
great makes sense you re not done you haven t brought down that one yet
confused your remainder is one but you still have to bring down that one one 6 -5 is one
11 you can t have remainder 11
11 i don t know how you got this
9 does 9 go into 11 2 times 9 11 -9 11 -9
2 you keep trying to do your subtraction backwards you can t do that did here s where you made the mistake 9 goes into 49 and you got 45
how did you get 49 here okay 9 goes into 49 again 5 times
no all right we re going to get it board let me check one last person
boards if ms g says you can do 6th grade math then why are you making the scores in my class that you re making
peetie you guys did really well i was impressed with some of you division you got it not a problem
it some of you were almost there please some of you are almost there but you re making some careless mistakes you re still struggling because i noticed that all but one of you are using long division
let s focus on long division for a minute long division that s probably the way your parents understand when you go home to do your homework that s the division problem your parents are going to be able to help you with however if you don t follow the same 4 steps every single time you re going to get it wrong so together we re going to do this one step at a time
i don t want anybody working forward i want you to do a step then i want to see your boards to see if you re missing it if it s the same step we re missing every time if the 2 of you can t sit beside each other i get that you just came back from ms math i absolutely disagree with her
now if you can pass that class that says that s 6th grade math you ve got to be able to pass my classroom because you re in 4th grade and you re not doing so well that does not mean you come in here and start having a conversation with or you ll sit over there by yourself okay i want you to stop after every step because we need to find out are you missing the same step every time
because if you are we can fix that or do you truly not get long division 1st let s take a simple problem because right now all i m interested in is the steps let s take a simple problem of 5 into 55
one right now i know it s simple and some of you are like this is ridiculous i get that step after the 1st step i want you to stop stop some of you didn t stop
one how many times really stop you 2 have a problem with step one anything you guys got step 11 listen up and
one i don t care about 55 5 how many times can 5 go into 51 the answer to a division problem when you re using long division goes on top of the umbrella seat i know
but is going to have a hard time listening to me if you re right there 5 the one goes there the answer to the division problem sits on top of that umbrella
do step 2
3 step 2 is multiplication one times 5 it s the answer you put up top times your divisor 5 if it helps you you can put a multiplication sign there step 2 is one times 5 is 5
you put your 5 over here because you re in the habit of putting everything back in the ones place in long division you re not going to do that because remember right now this 5 does not exist for me yet you ve got to remember that do step 3 step 3 is the subtraction step
did 5 -5 is 0 4 step 4
5 -5 is 5
step are you finished rules if you bring a number down you have to do those 4 steps again stop if you bring a number down you have to do those 4 steps again i brought a number down didn t i
do step one now please again yeah one only step one look what you did though you didn t put anything up there did you
that if you do that you ll do all this work then forget what the number was i don t need you to hold it up sweetheart do step 2 how did you get 55 here
2 this 5 needs to go under here step one 5 goes into 5 how many times one time
step 2 one times 5 is 5
done guys go back to your seats and let them have theirs in division you re doing the same 4 steps over and over again
work oops i can t dry erase board he did all of his work but he forgot to put his number at the top steps don t tell yourself you re going to go back later and put the number there what i m not going to give you 5 into 55 and you re going to forget what that number was
then you re going to go back into your work and figure it out and you re going to get it wrong you need to put these numbers up here as you work the problem method look at the method used
problem in groups we use different methods and that s okay because this is also a method you can use i want all of you to try this next method and we re going to use the same method how many groups do i have
5 draw your 5 circles room the reason i drew 5 circles is because the divisor is 5
groups you had 5 groups of something when i add all of those groups up it s going to equal 55 for simplicity sake let s pretend we don t know what that is okay door for simplicity sake let s pretend we don t know what that is
let s start out with i m going to give each group 2 2 put 2 in each of your groups
10 off to the side you re going to have 55 -10 and have 45 left 2 at the top that s where you re keeping track of how many you gave away i took away 2
you re going to have it here and you re also going to have it in your circle 2 because i want to keep track of what i have i just put it up there we re going to do this one right now i still have 45 that i need to get rid of
5 it s going to take me a long time and i m going to put 5 in each one circles i just gave away 5 so i m going to put 5 up here 5 right on top of it how many did i give away
25 i m going to subtract what i just gave away left i know i can t do 5 again careful i m going to give away 2 more i m going to put 2 in each one
10 i need 10 more i know i just gave away 10 and i have 10 left more i m going to add another 2 up there
10 i have 11 in that circle if you add up all of your circles you should have 11 in every one away i gave away 11
11 you can do this as well you have to keep track of what you re giving away until you don t have enough left to give away problem now that i have some of you that come back in my rooms students think they can have a conversation instead
no does everybody understand this method yes you have to use one of them this method is very much like the partial products method where you re getting rid of a couple at a time
it use any method that makes sense to you you have a quiz on friday and it will have word problems on it
far yeah wait
write your answer on your board and then circle your answer that s your answer ask yourself did you answer the question i asked you did you answer the question that i asked you yes please did you answer the question that i asked you
no be careful some of you worked the problem and you got the right answer to the equation but did you answer the question that i asked you
2 it can t is 0 a number
times did i say share or split your equation was correct but you didn t answer my question
yes write your answer it you have not answered my question yes i don t know can you i ve got somebody else huh
4 do the steps sit down bring down the 3 now you have 23 0 put 0 up there 0 times 4 is what you need to use a different one i can t see that one you did not answer the question you were asked
perfect what question did i ask you ask yourself what question did i ask you
listen i m a little concerned at all the talking
learn most of you got this far times 2 times 4 is 8 then you brought down the 2 and said i don t know what to do then you stopped how many times can 4 go into 2 it cannot therefore 0 times
0 times 4 is 0 bring down the 3 0 if it can t go into the number it s 0 at the top now 4 goes into 23 5 times 5 times 4 is 20
the answer to the equation is 205 remainder 3 what i asked you in my question was how many pieces will each of them get they will each get 205 pieces
that s why i tell you if you put down 205 remainder 3 that is the correct answer to the equation but it does not answer the question so in a division problem because of those remainders you have to be very careful
i m not always going to be asking you what is the answer to that equation back i could also ask you how many pieces did she have leftover if i were to ask you that question what would you tell me
how many pieces did she have leftover 3 so you have to be very very careful especially in division make sure you understand what question did she ask me
understand do you see how i ask that question
if i write 205 remainder 3 it would be wrong does everybody understand that
after honey you know why i use joe sue bob short use our names is that going to help you solve the problem
okay solve it
j you re always about to burst always i m going to talk to mom about maybe we need to find out why go drink you ve been in my classroom go
yes what s your answer it no
you how many did eat no yes
sit i want to know how many apples ate again please stop talking
eat how many did eat on a division problem especially word problems you just copied from him
answer show me the work that will support that answer there i counted my question was about but how many girls were eating apples 9 you need to ask yourself how many girls were eating apples
away please you don t need to do math in my class did you do that problem didn t does 9 go into one 9 times right which one s your answer
12 in this problem guys i m not always going to give you a number eat one
in this problem i m not necessarily going to give you all your numbers i told you that together they ate 110 apples 9 i had to take off because we re not doing 2 digit divisors 9 girls were eating apples
110 so your division problem is 9 into 110 9 cannot go into one so i would for now put a 0 there to hold that spot so you don t accidentally put something in there as you get better at division you will stop putting that 0 there
point it s a shame that we re knocking candy over because you shouldn t be eating any candy right now should you no how many times can 9 go into 11 once only one time subtraction 11 -9 is 2
0 again the 0 is a number you have to start looking at it as a number 2 put the 2 up here 2nd step 18 20 -18 is 2
down the answer to my equation is 12 remainder 2 question my question i wanted to know how many did eat
amount ate 12 apples careful wait a minute make if you do that the entire thing will be wrong
your math will be perfect
now that we re into division that s no longer the case it s more important than ever for you to make sure you know what i asked you because i might not be asking you the answer to that equation ate i can reword this and say how many apples did not get eaten 2 were leftover
so you have to be careful now that we re into division because i m going to ask you questions like that i want to know 1st do you know how to do the math and 2nd are you paying attention reading it carefully and answering the question you were asked
please last night you guys had some math homework before you go to lunch it get out your math homework please
that you have math homework hold it up fine if you didn t understand it and that s why you didn t do it you re still going to get credit for your homework and we re going to talk about it
after today s lesson i ll give you credit for the homework but do you want to see if you can figure it out now after today s lesson hold up your math homework please it do you have it m you don t have it
i need you to sit down now i need to check with and
it you don t have your reading homework as well reading set that on top of your whiteboards for now
mister 544 graders good morning mister
t i want to thank the people who have already glued in the geometry vocabulary and right now looking for the definition of i hope polygon i think he s looking for a definition because he s in that yellow section in the back of the book it s called a glossary
i ll give you a 2nd i ll give you another 2nd to get that glued in and find the definition of polygon
it sweet okay so it looks like everybody has their materials so i can give you one popcorn scoop already scoops there are 3 more scoops up for grabs for being responsible staying focused
there being kind and working hard level for those pokey puppies did anybody find what page is there a definition for polygon 376 page 376 132 i m going to use my handy dandy new black marker page 376
it s on page 376 who can read a definition of polygon 0 come on you stole my paper hey
polygon a closed 2 dimensional figure that is made of going end to end the line segments of a polygon may not cross all right polygon yes or no this is what we re going to play real quick yes or no is this a polygon or not
no why is this not a polygon at 1st it looks like it is but if you look closely you can see this is not a polygon why because it has an open side right there yes it has this open thing this is we can call that a gap so this is not a polygon gap so if i simply did a triangle shape that is a polygon
one no no okay what about this one
d no because it has curved lines yeah polygons are made up of what are called line segments line segments are straight this is actually a problem you might see in a computer game where they want to make a circle a lot of computer games make their shapes out of line segments so if you zoom in they might make a circle by making a bunch of little line segments that on their own are straight but they can form them into a circle
lookout would that be this one is if these are all straight mine are a little bit curved so if i can make these like all straight something like this anymore what but the point being you can t use curved lines in polygons
no why because it even though it has straight lines it needs to close yes it needs to be closed
0 is somebody a polygon is a flat 2 dimensional figure made of lines and has closed sides a polygon can have any number of sides as long as it has at least 3 the interior inside of the polygon is not a part of the polygon okay polygon no
sides what it s actually hard to close it with only 2 sides it s impossible yeah i would say it s impossible what about something like i m just going to draw these up here i m running out of space what if i had something like this
no no because it s not because polygons are 2 dimensional it s 2 dimensional that s a poly yeah i m trying to draw like a prism or box or something polygon it has polygon part of it it s made up of polygons but polygons are only 2 d so they re very flat
and with a polygon the inside is not part of the polygon just the lines are part of the polygon all right what is the inside space that s a good question okay has everybody written down the definition of a polygon okay
just we play polygon capture take a 2nd to look i gave every one this sheet when you walked in it s called geometry vocabulary i love the geometry unit because it gives us a chance to take a break from doing like computation with multiplication and division and get more into shapes
place if you re drawing you probably can use shapes in your drawings can you think of any jobs that involve shapes or how shapes fit together do they design and build stuff yeah and architect mainly designs what a building is going to look like
shapes if we take a very basic building like a house already there s polygons in it you probably wouldn t want to build that building right like that you d probably want to make it more detailed but you can see that buildings have tons of shapes in them
buildings are more and as we get more sort of fancy with the materials we can use we can make more add more shapes of different kinds to our buildings do they build they re more the ones that are building they have to measure stuff and make sure that it fits get the fun job of using a hammer to nail things down
nail guns yeah you can do some demolition work yep they already said architecture yeah that s what we were just talking about architects or architecture
shapes because you re managing a building and buildings when you build something it involves shapes my dad s a project manager i thought a project manager helped make sure that a project was running smoothly okay and you see how they all put it together okay i m still not clear about the shapes part but . an artist an artist right
shapes some artists really focus on shapes like that s their like picasso like picasso is very had a lot guy kind of took people and made them almost more angular and cubey yeah that s the kind of art my dad likes is what kind like he puts all types of shapes together to make a 0 cool okay mister
t s brother who actually passed away earlier this year he was a very famous mathematician and he studied what kind of shapes could be in a 3 dimensional space and he came up with a theorem what is it saying how many what s the maximum number of shapes you could have in any 3 dimensional shape it s sort of more called theoretical math where it s a lot of thinking about math and wondering what the possibilities of math are i m trying to think of other shapes other shapes other places we might use shapes
what was his name a stop sign okay yeah if you can t read how can you tell a stop sign s a stop sign right it s red and it s does anybody know what shape a stop sign is without looking at it
octagon octagon okay there s some really famous if you have to put like tiles in your bathroom or kitchen there s certain shapes that you could use the tile together and some you can t likes squares work really well for tiling a surface but octagons are not as good unless you have squares
okay i gave you this list of vocabulary because there s the shapes part of geometry is great but there s also a lot of like vocabulary that we re going to need to learn today we re going to be focusing on getting learning about basic shapes today but i want to give you this list so you can look over it and say 0 i know that one i don t know that one
that s one i m going to need to learn or that s one i m kind of fuzzy on can you all look over this list that looking over this list so there s some words on here you do recognize that you should just be like 0 no problem acute angles ..
like an acute angle what s an acute angle it s like a right angle s 90 degrees an acute angle is smaller than 90 degrees yeah
and . circle an a gap what s an edge an edge is like if you have a square and you fill in and like the lines close but not really on a square we call the we call the edges we call them sides yeah an edge is a little bit different
3 d what would the side on a box be called you the edge is where 2 sides meet of a box like a corner or a long sorry a corner is where edges come together but an edge is where 2 faces come together yes
that right angle is a yep okay a nice way to test to see if you have a 90 degree angle is like a lot of paper is already cut with 90 degree angles on it and you can hold that up to like if i wanted to see 0 is this is the angle of this house 90 degrees less than 90 degrees i can take a card or something that i know has a 90 degree angle on it and i can hold it up here
i m going to see does this angle here is this angle here bigger or smaller or the same as 90 degrees well if i try to fit my 90 degree angle here what do i notice it s bigger i m talking about this one right here the 90 degree angle is bigger than this angle right here 0 if i line up one side what do i notice that it doesn t . fit it doesn t come out the other side right
so it must be less than 90 degrees if i try the same trick on this i say okay i m going to measure this angle bigger or smaller than 90 degrees bigger bigger because it s like you can see the other one yeah i can t use my card to cover that angle completely so what do we call that when it s bigger than 90 degrees obtuse obtuse obtuse
large other words on here are there any on here that you re like what the heck the congruence congruent yeah okay congruence or congruent
yes huh yeah i don t know what should be the other 0 attribute attribute attribute is sort of like an adjective thing so what attributes do you would you say make a good student
like what skills do you think would make a good student okay focus attitude and have brains
start those are all attributes of being a good student organized what are some attributes of a triangle yes they have 3 sides they have 3 sides yes all even the sides are equal yeah not always in some triangles some triangles they re all equal but not all triangles are 0 that s a good word equilateral yes all equilateral triangles have all sides that are equal
it s right here are there any other attributes of triangles they each angle in a triangle is acute at least one will be but not necessarily all of them you could like take a look at my obtuse angle there what could i do to make that into a triangle
i could just draw a line across it will have 2 acute angles in it but . at least one yeah and i don t think you can have a triangle with 2 obtuse angles in it for if you can show me a triangle with 2 obtuse angles i d be very impressed
yeah is the base the perimeter is the base the perimeter what do you mean there s a base but i don t like in a triangle we usually call the base the this sort of this is called the base
around 0 so like the bottom part yeah i ll give you a better definition but yeah for the time being that works
yes i know a way to have a triangle with obtuse angles okay it has to be really big because so that so you have an obtuse angle at the top and then you have connecting obtuse angle and then it keeps going and going and going until it touches okay map yes i want you to take that big triangle and shrink it down and show me what it would look like
right raise your hand if you were not here on friday because you were having a good time playing with dolphins or you were on a track meet down so that means that some of you did not learn how to play polygon capture what i d like to do right now is show you how to play this game and then give you some time to play okay
listen and those of you who have already played i want expect you to make very thoughtful comments for those people who did not who has a copy of the pieces who has set i m sorry not a copy i guess a set of pieces here we re videotaping so maybe we can like leave some space open on this side so if you guys could like gather in a c shape on this side that would be great
i have mine so you have to be between and but on the other side you i have mine get out mister t i ll use s you re going to need yours for when you play come around here so that the camera people can see
if you are right by the table why don t you get down on your knees so that people behind you can see shh if you were here last week and remember how to play and i forget to say something raise your hand and i will call on you to remind us what i missed
that we have a set of cards so we have side cards which have attributes on the other side so for example this side card said all opposite sides are parallel in this shape what does it mean to be opposite for one side to be opposite of another side so like if i put my finger here like this side would be okay what side is opposite of this side
this get over here so if someone is opposite like your neighbor is opposite lives opposite you on the street where would they live street if they re adjacent that that means next door neighbors but opposite means across so that s like an example of a side attribute and we also have angle cards that have angle attributes so this one says there are no right angles what does that mean
angles yeah just find a shape with no right angles so we also have other than the cards we have the shapes themselves know they re 2 dimensional they re closed they have are made up of line segments
crossing no intersections no intersections they all say huh they all say because was responsible which is an attribute of good students and he wrote his name on all these that way because accidents happen and this falls on the ground and i find it i can say or if you find it or found it we can get it back to
works you decide who goes 1st rock paper scissors whoever s youngest whoever s oldest however you decide make it quick and you figure out that i m going 1st
you take a side card and an angle card so you notice i ve made them into 2 different piles it s easy to do and i put them down i m going to read them and i m going to try to find polygons that meet these 2 attributes the 1st one says my angle card says all angles are right angles all angles
angle it also says 0 this might be easy it also says all opposite sides are parallel without it going further can you think of what kind of shape has all right angles and all opposite sides are parallel parallel meaning they will never intersect intersect or diverge
think one of the 2 squares aren t why not both squares because no i can take as many shapes as i want that doesn t meet these attributes 0 because you don t need the 2nd square because that one meets both of them so let me be clear i can find as many shapes as i want that meet both of these attributes
2 squares so if there are 2 squares well let s make sure that one square works be no i know it can be hard to cut exactly but this is a square squares have right angles parallel so meaning like if i put my finger on these are these sides parallel yes yep they re never going to intersect or go away from each other
others raise your hand if you see another shape that will satisfy both attributes 0 because it s wait we ve already answered this question do we have to it has to meet both attributes 0 okay that s a right angle and are they all right angles
yes yeah and they are opposite are all opposite sides parallel are these sides yeah yes but they re not parallel to these ones no but as long as the ones that are opposite of each other are parallel we re in good shape
point this side this long side is not parallel to the short side it s adjacent they re actually perpendicular but the attribute says that the opposite sides are parallel so we re good to go take every other rectangle okay yeah all the rectangles i get j works c works and someone said and the a square
okay all rectangles no all squares no all rectangles no all squares are rectangles yeah all squares are 0 wait wait let me see i m not sure but f maybe let s take a look at f f looks appealing except for right angles it has opposite sides that are parallel does anybody know what shape f is called
there it s both yeah angles when i put the card up here you ll notice that i can t it s not this angle s too small and then this angle is too big too big that s interesting i think i m done
trapezoid if there was no shapes that if there was a shape that i could have gotten but i forgot to get and i say my turn s done before you start your turn you can say hey you missed this one and you get to capture that wait how do you earn points the idea is you re going to keep going until there s only 3 shapes left and whoever has the most shapes wins
talking so let s say it s your turn and you pick this side card says all opposite sides are parallel well there s 2 of those and all angles are what the heck one how come has 2 of each this one says there are no parallel sides and at least one angle is more than 90 degrees there are no parallel sides and then cross your arms when you think you ve found one
there are no parallel sides and at least one angle is more than 90 degrees i know k k k kite this is are there any parallel sides no and how do you know that s a commercial i know i know
i love that commercial okay okay don t get brainwashed by the media you can do it i think this angle i m holding it up to is yeah is this greater or less than 90 degrees that s a little less i think it s a little bit more
it got cut funny but you can there s no black lines so the black line would have been it got cut off so that one would work 1st are any of these sides parallel opposite sides parallel no
so and these are all none of them are 90 degrees some are more some are less sorry it says at least one angle is more than 90 degrees yeah sorry it has one angle that is more than 90 degrees at least one it has at least one so you guys those sometimes you get to a point where the 2 cards you have don t let you take anything
you are then allowed to take one more card off of either pile and try that card and if you still can t find anything it means that your turn s over but you have least one more card to draw to get a chance the game ends when there s only 3 shapes left and the winner is whoever has the most cards are there any the most polygons the most polygons yeah are there any questions
done 0 sorry you ve got a question yeah it said do you only use one set of cards or do you use 2 sets yeah set those of you who have not made them i ll tell you how to make them at the end of class where to get them play i want you to spread out around the classroom
you please be kind do we need to record that we re i think that s a good idea because then it will show me that you played
lost mister t lost my shapes they were in my computer and now they re gone ew girl you re in trouble your shapes yeah i thought i had some on the desk there there might be a pairing who has 2 shapes let me see
shapes yeah can borrow your shapes extra you re a good friend she is a good friend yep always where are you going to play you can play on the carpet here by the coat closet around the corner up why does it smell so good in here it smells like 0 that s me
is it does smell like cake 0 yeah it s like vanilla or something it s her 0 it s her it s not me after all it s down the hall it smells good all right you should be playing in about 37 seconds
are you guys too close to each other there s not much to keep score up here you could keep it s up to you how you want to score it but just in case like we do like 2 rounds okay mister
t i m kind of confused about the game okay because i really don t understand most of it
card and then let s say you have a side card do you mind if i borrow this as an example and then the side card says only one pair of sides is parallel so the idea is you have to find a shape that meets both of these requirements right and so it can have no right angles and it can only have one pair of sides that are parallel so if i chose one of these that went with this i just put the letter down you get to claim that shape
score until the end of the game you could maybe count up how many shapes you have okay so i really just want you really don t need to keep score not as much no 0 if you can find a creative some people are doing it by i don t know what they re going to they set it up yeah i d like to see it i m just not sure of the best way to record your score shapes okay i ll write down the names of the shapes okay so and you have to help each other out and just make sure that you re clear about what these are
i ll record you both can because then it will be in each of spiral 0 you guys weren t kidding you re really out here what how s it going good now you have to make sure you agree with what she s taking mister
t this is kind of impossible all opposite sides are parallel there is at least one acute angle so that you can t do that all the opposite s are yeah so should i just pull another card yeah you re allowed to pull one more
and it can be you could take either side or angles so that might affect . okay so should i just put back one of these or should i just just leave them both because you re going to get another one
okay and then 33 you ll have 3 altogether and then you can decide between the 3
same card how do i win so . so it says there are no right angles an all opposite sides are 00
one but she doesn t have one of these now what you can do is . 0 so these so these yep right so you ve got to help yourself you re not claiming those but you re just saying okay those are wrong well they re not wrong but they don t mister
t i have a question and then you know go through what s remaining and sort of see there s a square all of these that are like slanted well that might work okay i hear you but i m trying to help them
yes will choose how many yeah i got all angles are right angles and then while drew straight sides and so you re already what do you mean by straight they all have straight sides 0 yeah you want to get all those rectangles okay so it says all angles are right angles what can we say about the sides
sides they re all even they re all parallel okay go with that
okay so you just shuffle up your angle cards and make it it s like a discard pile 0 okay take your discards if these if you ve already used these you can just turn them over and sort them and reuse them i think this this is impossible all angles are right but there are no parallel sides all angles are right angles
more and you can take it either an angle card or a side card so decide could you one of these out though or . work isn t this a right angle no it is not
do you remember how i showed you how to yes
this f
0 he was right does that make sense was right i was right do you want to hold onto this as an angle tester did you finish your 1st game not yet
you re still playing okay but we re almost done if you run out of cards it s like a discard pile you just shuffle them up put them back in had to go to the bathroom so that s ah i see
3 2 i don t know how much is this why don t you find out one that doesn t count that s the card bad 9101112 i got 12 and he got 3 okay can you tell me what each of these shapes is
okay this is . you don t know okay no that s not an octagon hexagon hexagon okay there s another name for that one
rhombus rhombus rhombus triangle okay
is trapezoid rectangle rectangle okay
mister t should we go again if we re done yeah trapezoid okay we ve got about 5 more minutes
parallelogram parallelogram rectangle he got whatever have no idea what that is or whatever that is or how many sides does it have 12345 so that s a pentagon pentagon yeah
pentagon can we go to it s like an octagon or hexagon with less sides yeah how s it going
okay what could we do to make the game more challenging or exciting it s just cards and shapes you d rather do division yes yeah they ve been talking just give us the hardest worksheet it s all good i know what no you ve only been playing for about 12 minutes
so remember when i said are you too close to them and you re like no it s fine and i was thinking yeah right it feels like we ve been playing for an hour okay can we clean up back there then yes all right okay time s up yeah who said yeah shh
just have a seat attributes of good students them we re going to clean up
please he got a wild card and he said like all sides are parallel and all of them almost all of the polygons are parallel and at 1st he said all sides are straight and i m like yeah up all right can you all come back to your seats please
i ll give you a few paperclips would you like another paperclip
people 88 people i think that s s stuff
me well can i read it it s not the right time i m waiting on about 4 no i guess it looks like 6 people to show me that they are ready to go i m trying i m going to give you about 10 more seconds
seat okay okay you re homework tonight is to play a game of polygon capture with somebody at home
what for those of you who have not made the polygon capture pieces yet you can find them in the back you re going to need to take out both of your math journals journals the textbook journal the . i ll just take my math journal home no no let me show you
this one math journal yeah do you have the other one as well 0 yeah yeah yeah wait so 12nd so can you do the same in the back of that one in the back of math journal one there s these sort of card stock this heavier paper it s called activity sheet 4 here are your shapes you re going to have to cut these out please cut very carefully because when it says like this you know when you start looking for shapes has certain angles if your cuts are very bad it might be confusing
so you don t have to take this whole thing home all you need to do before you go home is gently tear this out it s perforated so you fold it 1st and you can fold it in both directions to kind of loosen that seam and you can tear that out
cards for some reason the way they got printed the cards don t line up so you just kind of choose it s okay you just cut these out the best you can play i also asked people last week to write their names on the back of each card in case we lose one we can try and get it back to you we re going to be playing this at stations tomorrow and on thursday so i do want you to have them as i said if there s some way to make this game more interesting adding shapes adding cards we can do that
we have computers we can print stuff out on card stock and cut them out and if you have an idea let me know m what shape because i lost mine i m hoping their going to show up hope so maybe check your locker or your backpack all the usual places
i how many rounds do we have to play of polygon capture i would say why don t you play for 10 to 15 minutes so it could be a few a couple of games c are we allowed can you rip out the things because i m very bad at ripping things out yes okay i want to get a little head start on what we re going to be working on tomorrow i m going to give you a sheet that looks like this and you re going to have to do some definitions of a bunch of basic shapes
i want to go over a couple now because there are some common mistakes that people make about what counts as a hexagon what counts as a pentagon so could you look in your student reference book for a definition of hexagon
hexagon hexagon can we write it down you don t need to write it down just find it
you can cross your arms once you ve found it let me know you re set it looks like this whole table found it
me hexagon hexagon hexagon what did you find hexagon a polygon with 6 sides a polygon with 6 sides okay now the example tomorrow i m going to ask you to draw a picture
in the book well you ve probably also you like we commonly think of this as a hexagon yes that is it a polygon yes yeah how do i know it s a polygon gaps just straight lines just made up of line segments
hexagon i m going to put this little dash mark on each of these sides that lets me know every side that has one dash mark is the same length so this is what we call a regular hexagon because all of the sides are the same length but hexagons don t have to be regular hexagons you can have what s called an irregular hexagon which is just a shape with 6 sides
yes a way you can remember that a hexagon has 6 sides is hexagon has an x in it as well as 60 i like that
hex equals 6 they both have the x s in them that s good i like that so but i can draw a hexagon like this one side 2 sides 3 sides 4 sides 5 sides and this is the 6th side mister t what that s not what we call a regular this looks pretty irregular doesn t it
yeah now maybe this side and this side are equal in length but a hexagon doesn t have to have sides that are equal in length it just has to have 6 sides 6 sides right is octagon the same thing yes octagon well not the same thing but well yes the same so if we were going to do octagon actually let s go down one
does anyone know what a polygon with 5 sides is called a pentagon yeah a pentagon so if i had a pentagon it would be a polygon with 6 sides with 5 with 5 sides now the regular polygon let me see if i can draw it it s a little bit harder it looks something like this
if you ve seen sort of like that tall yeah something like that too tall now this is you know this is a regular pentagon all the sides are the same length but we can do an irregular pentagon
12345 why is this a pentagon mister g well billy 12345 billy timmy billy is timmy s imaginary friend
0 you ve got to get that right guys yeah guys billy s in our class wait what was the question again i m not sure but you had your hand up no you asked i think you asked why that was there hexagon yeah why is this a pentagon that sounds like a good question because it has 5 sides and they don t all have to be equal but . is it a polygon yes
ding can you think of a shape that fits into more than one category we haven t talked a lot about this in detail but . yeah what s the deal with the square it s a rectangle it s a quadrilateral say yes without people interjecting
it it s a rectangle too and something else yeah yep it s a polygon it s a rectangle it s a square it s a quadrangle it s a quadrangle
it s a p p p ara parallelogram parallelogram it might even be a rhombus for all i know yeah it is a rhombus it is a rhombus okay so just like good students can also be sons and cousins and sisters shapes can fall into more than one category and we re going to be learning more about that in the next couple weeks before we go off to winter break
today homework for today i m still looking for a triangle with 2 obtuse angles if you happen to find one your homework is polygon capture and for science because i won t see you this afternoon i want you to do sunrise and sunset okay okay could you please wait what sunrise and sunset 0
could you please make your area so neat so neat that the queen could come in here and eat off of our tables without 0 good golly
sorry queen elizabeth shh
the 2nd no the 1st the 1st is the end
no you should have said okay everyone that s a wrap and that s a wrap and see you
all right on friday when we left off we were talking about different types of shapes different what word did we use to describe the ones that were the exact same
help us out congruent so our word that we are going to talk about for a moment is congruent now we need to come up with a definition of congruent and we kind of talked about this on friday but if we had to give a definition of congruent that we could use not some technical something a definition that we can use
the same size and shape same size same shape so if we have 2 different shapes that are the same size and 2 different shapes that are the same shape same ship size so basically they are going to have to be the exact same
looking around the room for a moment can anybody tell me or share with me an example of 2 things they see that are congruent b 2 pieces of paper right there so 2 pieces of paper
they might be the exact same shape and same size congruent they are the exact same size and the exact same shape u the birthday cakes that the birthday cakes are the exact same size and the exact same shape
c the 2 cameras okay the 2 cameras are each the well in that case we have 3 shapes that are congruent but yes we can put that m how about some non examples
non examples i am going to wait just a moment go ahead it is the opposite of what the definition says it is not the same size or the same shape it is different who can give me a non example the clock and the magnet the clock and the magnet are obviously not the same size and shape
non example we have got clock and magnet they are obviously not they are kind of the same size or same shape actually just not the same size l the door and the door and the what the door and the cabinets the door and the cabinet are clearly not the same size and clearly not the same shape
on we have some non examples we are going to work today to look at different shapes and how they are congruent and what they look like this is going to make a little more sense once we do our activity for today the 1st thing you need to do you will notice at your groups you have a bin that has some different supplies
2nd on the board i am going to list some things that you should both each have once you take your things out of the bin each person should have a geoboard which is going to be the clear plastic square paper you should have 2 crayons colors you should have fabric bands
you should have a total of how many 4 you should have one yellow one green one orange and one blue let us take about one minute and make sure everyone has their supplies
all right i am looking for a group that is ready and i do not see one yet
close group 4 is almost there
point group 5 looks like they are pretty close group one is close but they are missing 2 of the supplies
bin group 5 thank you check group 2
all right now that we have our supplies i should see your supplies on your desk and your hands are not on them you may have your hands sitting like this in front of you if you need to or if you can trust yourself to leave the things alone that is fine also i don t want to hear them or see us using any of them yet
moment all right the 1st thing that you are going to do is take your geoboard and choose one color use one of the color and you are going to create a shape piece of advice do not make it too complicated
if you need to twist this to make a smaller shape you can geoboard the only shape i do not want you to make actually you can make whatever shape you want
go ahead is this we are going to try not to
it one piece of string actually i am going to go back and change this
wait just a 2nd i like some of your creative shapes but i am going to run into one problem your shape needs to take up less than half of the geoboard
less than half one shape this you are fine
shape something else good make it smaller okay all right
smaller geoboards down
on your white piece of paper that looks like this the one that says congruent you are going to draw your shape on that geoboard mine i am just going to choose a colored crayon whatever i happen to have hand so here is my geoboard and here is my geoboard paper
i know it is 1234 and then i am going to this dot so that is my shape
draw that in your 1st geoboard box your shape draw your shape in your geoboard box
seconds that is not the shape you showed me work is that the shape you drew 54321 and 0
geoboard on the geoboard paper on top of the next box i want you to write slide just like i have done on mine
slide next to it i want you to write the word translate and i will explain that to you in just a moment write slide and translate if you have a pencil handy you can use a pencil if you would rather use a pencil than a crayon fine just like mine
slide just like mine on top of the 2nd box right so on the top of the next board you have slide and translate
it all right mean i am going to take another band and guys please be careful with these if we stretch them out we are not going to be able to use them anymore
shape i am going to wait until i have everybody is eyes up here and your hands are having nothing in them here i am going to slide my shape sliding my shape simply means i am going to move it i am going to take the exact same shape and i am going to slide it over so for example if i were to slide my shape let us take a look
do i have the exact same shape now as i did before yes no shape i just slid it from this position over to this position
what i am going to do now in my box that says slide or translate they both mean the exact same thing i am going to draw my original shape just like i have in my 1st box but then i am going to draw my 2nd shape which is still the exact same shape
it i am going to draw arrows showing that i have slid my shape or translated my shape on your geoboard you are going to do the exact same thing only should it be facing a different direction
only take your shape and slide it over on your geoboard yes so if we were going to slide it let us move it one space over if we did one place over is that the exact same shape over you can scoot it over
that is fine let us go back to the shape that you started with it can we use a different crayon for the 2nd one you can use a different crayon to show the different colors yes
it you have not slid it anywhere yet this downwards okay downwards perfect that yes a couple people have asked about using the different colors yes you can use the different color to show the different shape
slide yes you did not slide right can you slide it up like this is that the same shape no it needs to be congruent so go back to your original shape right take another color slide your shape up
so make it the same shape same size same shape
shape it will not do it no more go ahead they are own shape hold on now is this shape congruent yes
stop for a 2nd is this shape congruent no it if you slide every single spot up one is that the same shape box perfect okay where is it at
there see it there put this up here if you were to slide this shape draw it 1st
it does not matter i see that
okay so make the square okay it move it that way it does not work it is coming off so do it right here instead what is wrong with that it is stretched too much but do you get the point of it
it you have got 2 i think just about everyone is finished with their 1st slide their translate go ahead and have pencils down crayons down whatever you have down
set it down please table 3 is ready because everything they are using is down on their desk wrists i do not want to see us stretching them if we cannot use them correctly we will not be able to use them and i want us to be able to use them
the next one that we are going to do go to your 3rd box write the word flip you can not see that the word flip and under or next to that i want you to write the word reflect
reflect raise your hand if the word reflect makes you think of something mirror when you look into a mirror your image is reflected it kind of flips over into facing the other direction in the mirror
now i have my shape and i am going to flip my shape
this if i were to put a mirror right here and i were to flip it over this line my shape would now look like this line is it still the exact same size
flipped so you are going to flip your shape and then you are going to take your paper and you are going to draw the flipped shape for example there is my shape flipped go ahead and flip your shape on your geoboard and then draw it onto your paper
yes i can not slide because you used more than half of your sheet so you are going to have to use a different shape like this perfect a couple people are finding they do not have enough room to flip their shape
if you do not have enough room to flip your original shape you can switch to another shape so you can flip it shape if you find that you are one of those people change shapes to something that you can flip
on if you were to flip it over what would it look like that right i think i am doing something wrong you did it exactly right square no you did not
line that is a slide it it needs to flip over this line whatever is on this paper flip it over
mirror okay stop for a 2nd if i take this do you see what it looks like
side stop please show me your original shape use the yellow one yours is flipped good
works this one is pick a different one and there is a reason why it will not tell we have been sitting here doing this so you are going to have to find a way to make it work with what you have that is a mirror yeah it is a mirror so we can see what it should look like once it is flipped i hear you
hand okay if i were to flip it over this line what should it look like
side 54321 and 0 i am looking for groups that have their pencils crayons down
hands so far that is group 3 group one thank you group 2 and group 5 all right
the last one that we are going to do the last way that we can take a congruent shape and we can still keep a congruent shape but it is not in the same position we can turn it so the last box we are going to put turned or rotate
back once you have written that down i am going to go back to my original shape 2 all right
shape i like the fact that i see almost everybody in group 5 with their eyes up here seeing what we are going to do group 2 we are going to take a point away all right so i have my original shape and i am going to rotate it now rotating it or turning it is a little bit different than sliding
this means that i am going to take the shape but i am going to turn it in a different direction for example if i were to turn this shape i might turn it and see if that would work
shape 1234 work let us do 1234 in this case i turned it
it i kind of flipped it and turned it because i am going to run out of space otherwise instead here we go this would be an example of me turning my shape
all i have done is i have taken it from where it was and i turned it so it is facing a different direction i did not flip it and i did not slide it
i turned it let us try turning our shapes on our geoboards and then drawing your new shape onto your paper
rotate yes on that would work let me see this please is it like this
12nd you can look on with okay let us try a different shape because you seem to be having a lot of trouble with this shape them pulling them makes it very hard to use them okay
shape just turn it in a different direction shape like that yes
work you need to use this shape for this it yours is fine not a problem this time instead of your base being here make your base right here
shape yes is it just turned there you go angles would this work yes is it just turned yeah i messed mine up
it excellent did you turn it reflection i would probably turn it and put it somewhere down here what if we did that
turn there you go works i am going to use mine
okay let go paper perfect you drew that on your paper
good that would actually not be a rotate one i just what would it be more like
alike that would be more like a slide
table 4 and 5 were our 1st tables ready all right excellent job now i think everybody has them on their paper we are going to do one more thing but i am going to have you leave your stuff out just in case you need it so i need a volunteer 0 my goodness you have no idea what you are volunteering for
i am going to need a volunteer and you are going to act out one of the things that we just did you are going to act out a slide a reflect or a rotate and then we are going to have to guess which one you are acting out up hold on
believe kind of like charades what i want you to be doing right now while we are waiting for to share with us her interpretation of a reflection a slide a turn a rotation whatever one she gets good idea
i am going to show it to her and she is going to show us her demonstration is once you have your guess about what she is i am going to wait just a 2nd because i do not have everyone is attention desk i should see your fabric loops on your desk
desk all right when you know which one she is you can raise your hand and we will see who is going well of course you are going to know which one you are i am going to see who is able to guess her correctly
eyes go ahead there do not let anybody see it paper you know which one you are going to do
arms you can do it with your whole body rotate were you rotate she was rotate excellent job come on up
i just set your paper up there we only have 2 left when you know which one she is raise your hand go ahead hold on
you can do it with your hands if you need to pass job we obviously know there would be one left
head when you are ready touch your nose right your ticket out the door for today you need to answer number one on the overhead it says it is a little bit hard to read so i am going to read it to you
it says which picture appears to show steve is body angle at an angle congruent to the angle shown above so we have got steve is body angle which looks something like this choices i know it is kind of hard to read the choices without having the lights off
the 1st choice is like this the 2nd choice the 3rd choice some of them look similar but you need to look at the actual angles which of those is congruent to steve is body shape
write your name and the letter you chose on your card
it your name and the letter you chose
t nice job with a pencil nice job you will need a pencil yes you will need a pencil for now
all there was a clipboard here
now you just got to follow directions i asked you to bring a pencil it i am going to ask that you immediately stop playing with the pencil move finish last time i am going to ask you pencil thanks
trash good spot for a pencil right now would be a pocket or a clipboard you do not need a clipboard right now so just leave it be chart it is going to be colorful again you talk you play around you are not following directions your clip is going to move and i hate to say this i do not want you in my room if you are going to play around we do not have time for it
we got kids showing up not ready to be here to learn and you do not deserve to be in my classroom if that is the way you are going to behave straight out you do not deserve to be in my classroom if that is the way you are going to behave community yesterday was sick disgusting and now it is on camera
your behavior was unacceptable 150% you embarrassed yourself
school several too many not one not 2 not 3 not 4
around i do not plan on wasting a 2nd of my instruction time today goodbye thank you am we have to move on
fractions we took a day yesterday to practice adding and subtracting mixed numbers here you are not paying attention during the mini lesson
together and then when you went back you were not able to figure it out or you did not push yourself hard enough me if i send you back to your desk to do independent work you better do your work
conversations if you have independent work to do that is your time to practice what you just been taught yesterday you were taught how to add and subtract mixed numbers disruptions it was maybe a little tough to follow but you got to work harder to follow and if something does not make sense you need to ask a question because fractions are really really really hard things to understand
that i know that but i have been teaching them to you grade i think you can do a better job focusing and a better job practicing when you go back to your seat take that seriously cause that is the time you are going to find out teacher i can not do this
and that is okay but instead of sitting there and playing around we need to fix the problem well somewhat challenge thanks we are going to start out by and we have done this before
numbers usually we do it with maybe 5 maybe 10 maybe 20 some easy landmark numbers j so we are going to count around the room by a fraction
much i need you to go sit at the gray table please earlier on the back side please and and as well can you sit at the gray table on the back side with your back towards the front board
side me too and can you scoot away from the table please i have created a number line 4th i do not want you to use the mixed numbers numbers so you are still with us you just can not be in view that is all
numbers i want you to when it comes time we will have a conversation about what is going to happen but think about fractions and think about what is going to happen when we hit a certain amount of people or a certain number of people 4th as we count teacher is going to make a number line and i am going to keep track of what is happening
you i am going to say 0 you are going to start we are counting around the room by what eighths no i had a feeling you were not listening we are counting around the room by fourths so you are going to be 14th thanks i would be extremely careful today
step outside whoever want to step outside you are next 2 fourths 2 fourths nice 2 fourths is equivalent to what k 2 fourths it is equivalent to a half
next 14th 2 fourths 3 fourths 3 fourths 4 fourths please do not shout out go ahead aint 14th equivalent to 2 eighths 14th is equivalent to 2 eighths good for you
whole one whole so if knows that 4 fourths is now equivalent to a whole what is something that you can say now about the rest of our counting what are we going to be talk to me about that j improper fractions you are going to now have improper fractions
fraction when the numerator denominator good for you line we stopped at 4 fourths next is going to be what
what would you say 14th 24th 34th 44th 5 fourths 5 fourths nice what is next 64th 6 fourths what is next 7 fourths 7 fourths so we have some improper fractions
it is really important that you know notice that and that is great improper fractions when your numerator is larger than your denominator you should notice that and you should think in your head i now know i have more than one whole one and that is hard because usually when we are working with fractions we are always smaller than one
i had some really nice personal conversations yesterday about speaking in different languages between improper fractions and mixed numbers landmarks i did put one whole and 2 whole when we got to one whole we were at 4 fourths if i asked you what this value was as a mixed number could anyone tell me that instead of an improper fraction
what would that value be as a mixed number 5 hands 6 hands 6 fourths 6 fourths one.51.5 nice one.5 looks like you are i think
it if you are at 6 fourths you are at one.5 we left off at 7 fourths we left off at 7 really outside we left off at 7 fourths and that was yes
what is going to be next 4 i mean 8 fourths 8 fourths what do you know about 8 fourths it is equal to 2 it is equal to 2 whole so one whole is made up of 4 pieces if we are talking about fourths 2 whole would then be made up of 88 pieces
relationships and this is big time stuff but we can also simplify improper fractions we have worked a little bit with simplifying we will call them proper fractions but you are also able to simplify improper fractions so 8 over 4
anymore 8 over 4 is equivalent to 2 whole and that is important a i thought 2 of the same numbers was supposed to be a whole so 2 of the same numbers like 4 over 4 that is equivalent to one whole now instead of 4 fourths i have twice as many
i have 8 fourths so therefore i have enough fourths to make myself 2 wholes let us continue on and we will see what happens when we get let us make a prediction then if i want to jump right to 3 whole how many fourths are there going to be in 3 whole
nice so just count by fourths so if i left off at 8 fourths and i just want to count by fourths so we are going in order by fourths 14th 24th 34th we left off at 8 fourths what is going to be next thanks so we are counting by fourths
14th 2 fourths 3 fourths 4 fourths 5 fourths 6 fourths 7 fourths 8 fourths 99 fourths 10 fourths go ahead 10 fourths 10 fourths a 11 fourths 11 fourths number so thinking about what your whole number would be
be 11 fourths 11 fourths how many wholes did we get to 2 wholes we got 2 whole
have one so here was 2 whole 1232 and 3 fourths and let us test our theory i am going to take it to the next level here and and are the only ones that had this conversation i believe you should be able to switch back and forth between mixed numbers and improper fractions
that we can think about mathematically if you know 2 wholes equal to 8 fourths you can figure that out i got 2 whole then you just need to count up if you got 11 fourths figure out how many extras you have extras nice job there is a pile of papers please here is what is going to happen today
and here is how it is going to get challenging today you are going to receive some problems some serious problems these problems are going to have to do with you are actually going to have a pretty cool heads up you are going to be a little bit ahead of the game just because of the morning work that teacher likes to give you
today instead of adding and subtracting mixed numbers you are going to practice multiplying a whole number times a fraction which is really what you are doing right here smaller and here is some tools that you are going to have so you are going to have some blank fraction cards and they will come in very very handy
you have got blank fraction cards for thirds nice i made lots of thirds just so that we were prepared the nice thing about thirds is you can also make sixths sixths real easy cause you can cut them in half
ninths you also have on one of these sides maybe not thirds i did fifths you also have some fifths which are done for you me now you have also got some blanks you have got some blanks because you are going to come across things like fourths
you are going to come across things like fourths and for some reason they did not make a fraction card for fourths fourths fourths are easy cut it in half cut in half again
fourths good question since our thirds and our fifths are going to be cut vertically i would cut your fourths vertically as well so i am just going to make some fourths and they are not beautiful and yours do not have to be beautiful
question so i have made some fourths out of my fraction cards done today i am going to give you some problems 2 you are going to see a whole number like 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6
i do not think you will go above 10 but you are going to see that whole number and we are going to multiply that whole number times a fraction problem for example i am going to give you the problem that looks like this 3 times 3 fourths
please look alive scary i am going to show you right now how to beat it it there are several ways you can attack it
you have the resource of the fraction cards to shade can you please stop you have the resource of the fraction cards to shade fourths i am going to give you a story context listen to the story context that might help you think the problem through a little bit
mister j bought 3 kinds of pizza for a pizza party mister j bought 3 kinds of pizza for a pizza party so there is your 3 pizzas each pizza was the same size
3 and here is perhaps 3 pizzas we will only need 3 of those fraction cards though so at the end of the party there are 3 fourths of each pizza left
there are 3 fourths of each pizza left together so you are going to set it up are you going to be upset when i ask you to move your clip
go to level one please go to level one please here is how you should attack it i here is pizza number one here is pizza number 2 here is pizza number 3 we do not need the 4th fraction card yet
you will probably use it maybe on the next problem but so far we just have 3 pizzas so say there is a cheese pizza pizza number one is a cheese pizza nobody wanted it there was 3 slices or 3 out of the 4 pieces are still left over
there there are 3 fourths of a pizza left there and there are 3 fourths of the pizza left here
now we are not talking pizza we are talking fourths can you sit up please we are not talking pizza we are talking fourths so now you should be able to figure some things out i have got 3 fourths and 3 fourths 0 and i skipped one and 3 fourths
up how many fourths do i have left over g 3 fourths i have 3 fourths in every single pizza left so how many fourths all together do i have left how many fourths have i shaded in 12 so i shaded 3 here 3 here 3 here
99 fourths 9 fourths and some of you will have now that you have seen 9 fourths you may see a connection here so 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 4 is not 4
work that will not always work be careful great can we make that a mixed number
whole how many fourths are there in one whole 44 fourths in a whole and we have 9 fourths so how many wholes can we make a 2 i am thinking it is 2 wholes good for you we can make 2 whole we can draw them on the number line so 8 fourths was 2 whole and we have 9 fourths
so we definitely have 2 whole and then we have a 4th left left so shading will help visual if you are able to add 3 fourths +3 fourths +3 fourths and visualize it in your head that is okay as long as you are making sense of it
context i think that will help as well and most of the problems will give you a story context
focus teacher this is like when we have the whole number did not you say that the whole number and then the numerator that 3 times 3 is 9 just be careful of the denominator cause you can not multiply the whole number by the denominator here it is
in so you can use this white space to draw a visual representation and that is going to be important cause that is the only way you are going to be able to make sense of this hungry at the end of the party 3 fourths of each pizza was left all number 2 tough to see
apologize number 2 says a class is counting by 2 sixths we counted by 14th here a class is counting by 2 sixths remember you are multiplying a fraction by a whole number so for number 2 you are going to multiply 2 sixths times what 7
7 number 3 they do not give you the story but you could come up with a story problem to go with number 3 6 times 13rd or number 4 3 times 3 eighths that is easy 3 times 3 eighths and then number 4 is it
done i do want you to draw a visual representation to go with number one in i do expect to hear conversation within your groups about what you are thinking tough you are going to have to put some brains together to attack this work we are back for a quick conversation about some of your work
go any questions do you have to draw all the i am going to give you access to blank fraction cards
so you will have access to blank fraction cards thirds fifths and real blanks and you can draw them this is meant to be a visual for those of you who need it
this it might be nice to have some guidelines of what size to use space and if you are doing it mathematically without shading anything in that is okay too
good question move to our seats yes you are good to go
here here
so i had a conversation the other day about going back to your seat and getting to work not wasting time
it you may have conversations folks about these problems conversation it is tough tough tough what now we did this one yeah it 3 pizzas 3 fourths of each pizza if you are drawing pizzas that is cool
me just make sure that you cut up enough fourths we got to cut them no use can we go to a table no at let us go
time we had this conversation how many pieces mister j bought 3 kinds of pizza each pizza was the same size so you are going to want to draw how many pizzas 3 whole pizzas or you can just use these as your pizzas apparently some people were not very hungry so they did not eat
this this is your one pizza but i would cut it up into 4 pieces just 4 pieces so you are going to need 3 pizzas right and then you cut it up into 4 slices correct write those equations that match the word problem
problem so 3 times 3 fourths teacher i do not get it me i do not get how to find out the answer after that of this 11 write the equation 1st
thirds teacher i think it would be 14 sixths and then you keep the 6
out i am going to make you some sixths there is my pencil so people are counting by sixths i am sorry they are counting by 2 sixths counts 2 sixths on the same thing sure
can there is 2 people 3 people 3 people 4 people 4 people 5 people 6 people fractions fractions fractions hold on one person 2 person 3 people 4 people 5 people 6 people 7 people
14 got it you try to turn into a mixed number use this
fourths so then treat these like your pizza so treat 3 of those like whole pizzas cut it in half 1st and then cut into fourths it is easier that is fine
good so there is your 3 pizzas now there is 3 fourths left here i shade in 3 fourths there is 3 fourths in pizza one there is 3 fourths in pizza 2 there is also 3 fourths in pizza 3 that is it
how many fourths were left 123 fourths it is confusing cause we are thinking the opposite way
left 9 fourths so pizza one there is somebody ate that piece there was 3 pieces left and then there is 3 pieces left here and 3 pieces left here pizza and somebody ate one piece of that pizza but they left 3 others here and this one you got too many boxes
fifths so let us just use this one go so we are going to skip that one
teacher i am going to need on this one yep there is some sixths 1st person counted by 2 sixths next person 2 sixths
yep cause they are skip counting by 2 sixths so 3 sixths 9 fourths 2 sixths 6 sixths nice it might help out if you think about actual pizzas so we know usually a pizza is round
146th so this piece is eaten this piece is eaten this piece is eaten left 3 fourths 3 fourths 3 fourths 369 fourths so there is 9 fourths pizza left
if you wanted to make a mixed number so we know that that takes 4 fourths so one whole pizza is 4 pieces so 4 fourths equals one whole so we have 9 fourths so we have enough for 2 whole pieces so we have enough for 2 whole pizzas plus we still have 14th left
there is 2 whole pizzas left plus a 4th plus a 4th good how good you want some sixths sixths i need sixths so take the thirds and cut them in half
sixths i need i am on 6 times 13rd that is an easy one here huh there are 6 stacks yes
one this one sixths i need help with this one because i do not know if it is a whole or not you are thinking about thirds what is 8 divided by 4
had a conversation this morning about going back to our seats and making sure we are being productive on work not playing around not disrupting our classmates i do not like this cause i do not know if the 6 is a whole or if it is not a whole so how many sixths would be in a whole saying yeah that so i just made you some sixths and now you can skip count
kid 1st kid said 2 sixths next student said 2 sixths next student said 2 sixths so keep going counted every single student who counts is good for 2 sixths
going 5th student i think i found the answer teacher but i am not sure
did awesome teacher i think that is the answer and at the same time i think it is 6 and 6 there 6 times 13rd 6 so let us think about a story context
i had the stories are confusing i had 6 that did not work shade so you have to think about 6 times a 3rd careful so if you are turning a mixed number this is not a mixed number you are multiplying those 2
careful good you beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
so even this early in the morning we already had some concerns with our self control and doing a better job being productive in that independent work time at so if your back is to teacher and some of us got through number 2 some of us have not gone through number 2 so i just want to show you really quick how you should be thinking about it and if you use the resources of the fraction cards i know it is tough and they bother some of your eyes and things like that
but they are really helpful and they make things really clear can you turn and find teacher at the elmo please got even after we did it together most of you went back and still struggled through it still drew a picture whether it was pizzas or blank fraction cards that was great stop number 2 switches it up
please you are not able to use fourths anymore so you have to switch gears thirds so what teacher and and and and did was we made up some sixths
pretty number 2 says that students are skip counting by 2 sixths they are skip counting by 2 sixths the 1st thing you should have done is written an equation that matches that and that is really important
so you have 7 students and each student counted by 2 sixths some of you also found some neat little patterns today you know you have already lost your privileges for today so do not lose them for tomorrow do a better job listening paying attention being respectful scholars
7 students 2 sixths for each student 2 now some of you found some neat little things some neat little shortcuts but my suggestion to you is use what you got
in so each student was saying 2 sixths so we just shaded in 2 sixths count next student said 2 sixths or 4 sixths so we have used up so far l next student there is 8 sixths
counted 5th student there is 10 sixths nice job listening student there goes 12 sixths and we have one more student 14 sixths there is student number one student number 2 student number 3 student number 4 student number 5 student number 6 and student number 7
counted by the time they got done counting they had said 14 sixths so they got up to 14 sixths and i challenged some of you was anyone able to turn that back into a mixed number so figure out how many sixths go into a whole and then think about how many sixths you have
so my 1st question how many sixths go into one whole 66 sixths equal one whole do we have enough to make one whole yes whole yes yes for sure 2 whole and what 2 sixths
here it is not in simplest form but that is okay cause we are dealing with sixths if we put it in simplest form the easy way was because it is 7 times 2 equals 14 and a lot of you found out it looks like now be careful it looks like you can do 7 times 2 and hold your denominator and it might work out okay
in nice job listening desk i want to check that out leave that on your desk cause i want to check that out make sure you got some work done that if you got nothing done be prepared for me to say stay put obviously most of you at least gave it a shot and that is much appreciated tough i want this paper on your desk
the rest of your math things can go back in your desk please
great so everybody has in front of them a small piece of do now work you if you don t have enough room here you can do your work on another side of the page party why because we re doing a combination problem but we can do it today well no i just want to talk about the do now work here
and the do now work says how many combinations can you make thinking teacher r wants to make cupcakes for her birthday she has many choices to make each cupcake can be one flavor one type of frosting and one color sprinkle who can tell me what flavor cupcakes can i choose from
i it says chocolate yeah no just the cupcake flavors
yes chocolate vanilla and that s all okay so my flavors of cupcakes are chocolate and actually let me move this down and vanilla great
b frostings huh so the kind of frosting space okay frosting it s like the same that you can yeah when you have your cupcake let me draw my cupcake up here
bit that s my cupcake outside and then what flavors of frostings do i have you looked and you have pink yeah green and yellow okay
now are you doing the tivo yeah on how many how many what how many cameras did you turn on yes well let s is it looking this way the camera is facing 3 different directions
hard so who can tell me what s the last choice i need to make with my cupcakes you sprinkles and the sprinkles are the little bits i put on top of my cupcake like this
s stars hearts 2 of them are circles and circles and a circle is like this use please right now figure out how many different combinations can i make
minute you could make a tree you can do any strategy that you like the tree multiplication problem or lists lists i m not going to answer questions for another minute or 2 works ah brilliant thank you
come take your head out of your hands please okay let s get started and plus i ve got chocolate and vanilla cupcakes right cake i could either have a pink chocolate cake right
cake what other color cake can i have look at g r together grrr grr grr green green cake and what s the last color ya yellow and i can have a yellow chocolate cake
great if i had a chocolate cake that s pink i want to put sprinkles on top saint what s this one say star good so i can have stars so i can have a chocolate cake that s pink with stars on it
heart i can have a chocolate cake that s pink with heart with hearts on it this or i can have a chocolate cake that s pink with circles circles so those are 3 chocolate cakes i can have right there cakes i could also have a chocolate cake that s green with the green frosting on it
frosting i think i m done i think i m going to move you just a little bit over here cause i think the people who are watching the video might not want to just see you can you pull your desk over please move your desk over please 0
way that s all right for right now she was going to go write the you can have a chocolate cake with green frosting and what kind of sprinkles saint stars right can i have a chocolate cake with green frosting with what else on it
with hearts with hearts and with stars and with circles 0 so i can have a chocolate cake with green frosting 3 different kinds too so you know what i know i can have a chocolate cake with yellow how many different kinds of yellow chocolate cakes can i have
that with stars how many did i have right up here circles stars hearts and circles there will be 3 more
have wait 33 pink ones 3 green ones and 3 yellow ones how many is that all together the answer yeah 99 so you can have 9 chocolate so 9 chocolate how many do you think that we ll be able to have with vanilla if we do this whole tree again down here
3 probably 9 again okay green you re embarrassing me right now that open up your notebook please i m done yeah so probably 9 here can i have your attention please put 2 feet underneath your desk open up your math notebooks to the right page and help me out
we have a few different strategies that we learned i think last week hands open your math notebook now please thank you answer so it makes me wonder what you ve been doing i was doing 3 and 3 because 3 equals can you help me out
list and you can do chocolate yeah pink frosting and stars huh chocolate can i abbreviate chocolate ch
yes okay pink and hearts and hearts chocolate yeah pink and circles okay so i m noticing that you re organizing it by chocolate i want to stop your list for just a 2nd and i want to go to the tree diagram okay and just talk about how the tree diagram and the list relate to each other
is there watching up on computer yes the camera is watching all of you right now i know most of them except for the 3 kids back there and it s i m not going to see it now now can we answer camera questions after the lesson cause this was really not what i wanted to do for the whole math lesson said she said chocolate and she went to the pink frosting
so we can have chocolate cupcake with pink frosting sprinkles so we can do we can have heart sprinkles star sprinkles and circle sprinkles those are all of the different chocolate pink cupcakes that i can have
what other frosting colors can i make with my chocolate cake chocolate yeah green frosting great and heart no stars can i do hearts also circles yes 0 so there ll be 3 different kinds of green chocolate cupcakes love it so i can do hearts stars and circles
2nd there are 3 different kinds of pink chocolate cupcakes i can have how many different kinds of green chocolate cupcakes can i have back away we can make 3 okay is there another flavor of frosting that i can make my chocolate cupcakes into
12nd you just i didn t want to stop you from working focused you were good yellow frosting
cupcakes yum my favorite i have 3 different choices of frostings pink green and yellow and then i ve got my sprinkles for the top 3 different choices so before i write because and i were talking about how we were getting a little bored with this c yes it s a little bit boring
no how many different kinds of yellow cupcakes do you think i ll have 3 yellow there were 3 pink be yellow heart or stars 1st the stars 1st the stars okay
and the hearts good and the circles good so how many yellow cupcakes could there be that are chocolate 33 minute we ve done the top half of our tree
tree how many choices were there for the top half of our tree here 0 my god i m wondering what you re doing right now in so we have 9 types of chocolate cupcakes
choices since i want to move on to the next lesson because my math objectives are to go back to breaking apart factors and writing complete sentences that answer the question i want to make sure we get to that today so if i know i have 9 chocolate choices how many vanilla choices do you think i m going to have
somebody take that out of your mouth please okay thank you i don t know i try in portuguese i should know that word it s my favorite
no yes i think there will be 9 vanilla no i do not think there will be 9 vanilla you re not thinking i m thinking about just answer thinks there will be 9 vanilla choices there were 9 chocolate could there also be 9 vanilla yes or no
agree and instead of making the whole tree i know is right there will be 9 cupcakes 9 i m really not pleased with the way you re sitting right now
choices so looking back sit the right way please thank you sit the right way please sit the right way you so the question is how many combinations can you make
sentence the question was there can be 18 combinations how many how many combinations can you make
a there can be 18 combinations so this is why i ll take a different way from the tell me you might well you can make 18 combinations i love em both
yours we can make 18 combinations 0 so instead of you we equations 2 times 3 times 3 equals 18 combinations i have 9 times 2 2 can you explain to us where did this 2 come from
from the 2 flavors and the 3 came from the 3 frostings and the other 3 came from the 3 sprinkles please stop that this is wrong teacher r
please once you ve copied down your equation close your math notebook film no i want to stay thank you this try not to look at it
okay it s going to be more helpful for the people watching if we ignore the camera okay i m really not pleased with the way you re behaving right now close back up please okay
here we ve been talking about different strategies to solve difficult multiplication problems yes probably cause they always are we going to careful behind you please
today good okay attention back over here so let s take a look at this right here who can read the question that i wrote up here c 0 my what don t forget 0 w says ow
good many wow arms this is an arm me stop it octopus has thank you very much how many arms do 24 octopuses have octopus have octopuses this is more than one octopus well 8 so let s see
how many arms does one octopus have see i ve got 1234567 and 8 teacher r the equation is 0 i m so sorry
24 so we have our equation equation here is is 8 let s take a look at the equation for a minute i just want to talk about some of the important words that we re going to need does anyone remember what this number i know it s an 8
that did anyone know what of the equation this is factor so we ve got right here we ve got 8 is a factor in that equation so if it can still here you even if your camera can t see you okay if 8 is a factor what is 24
factor it s a factor also there does anyone know what the answer to a multiplication problem is called
it now we ve learned a couple different strategies to do this one of them is if you take a look up there breaking apart one of the factors factors so as we re looking at 8 and 24 which factor does it make the most sense to break
b you can do 10 times 8 no so which factor are we breaking up then teacher r no 10 yeah okay you need 2 10s and 4 please don t shout out like that okay so says we re going to go with s strategy for just a minute
eager says okay if i have 8 times 24 which i ll write right here for us says okay that could be 8 times 10 10 sense yeah another 8 times 10
please go change your name teacher r so wait a minute i just want to back up a minute where did and and somebody else whose voice i heard back up please where did they come up with 10 10 and 4 attention where did those numbers come from i really am i just don t even know what to do right now
from are you listening where did the 10 the 10 and the 4 come from you know this cause you did it for me yesterday and on your homework last night i know they were break like they would probably break it
then they do have 8 times 10 8 times 10 equals 80 +80 80 yes but what i want to i want to back up for just a minute
here yeah this was i mean can you explain a little further what is trying to get at because there s 20 they put 10 and one that s 8 times 10 and 8 times 10 they break that 20 to 10 ah so we can break 10 into 3 pieces i mean 24 into 3 pieces 10 +10 +4
4 no are you now teacher r teacher r it only can be 2 ways you can half no you can do it 3 times you can do more than half 10 a half get em all 24
j i guess i ll answer sure the answer is 100 and move over here so you can see 192 whoa hoo hoo hoo
i moving over to this area 192 brain i think i think that he was adding 80 +81st no and he knows cross your legs please he knows that 8 +8 is 16 and then just add a 00 add a 0 so that s 160
so he knew 80 +80 was 160 32 yeah so i heard him as he was thinking out loud 0 i m going look alive a i heard him say 160 +30 160 170 180 190 +2 more
z is that a z 192 great i need now a sentence
it the question is how many arms do 24 octopuses have 8 24 october 24 +8
while 24 octopus good have 192 arms what a beautiful answer that s good and we know that this is one strategy that we have
it breaking apart this right here is our breaking apart strategy who can tell me strategy i m really i m getting upset here at this point please i bet you can do it before the end of math strategy what is a strategy
b it s like 0 man can somebody help her tough what does that word strategy mean this combinations that you can make a lot of combinations you can make well i ll give you a hint
you can you use different strategies to solve problems it s like different answers it s almost a strategy helps you get an answer it s a lot of ways that you can get an answer yeah yeah it s a different way to help you get an answer
for instance yesterday was it you who came to me you and that was his 1st strategy it didn t work
yeah it s like his 2nd strategy was to come to me it i went to coach d 1st well 0 i didn t realize coach d was the 1st strategy
it was when i think i forgot to tell him then i and then i was trying to open it and i couldn t it was stuck and i came to you and then you came to me here get your back here please whoa wait a minute
off topic but your social studies notebook shocking here we ve got our breaking apart strategy and we also have this strategy up here i arrays array strategy love it
thing we are going to make also our array strategy loves this strategy so she uses it all the time don t you
24 so would anyone mind if i changed it to 24 times 8 see 24 it s not going to be exact but that s all right isn t it yes it s not our class it s not our class
it s it s math math class so i ve got 24 times 8 80 i think it was my friend my teacher my old teacher she said that 24 the corner times and then the 0 i like that okay teacher r one i found the same that i tried to tell you that like
that s your last i got the answer and you found it like that 4 so i m going to break this up and let s see i don t know i wish i had done a better job but that s all right
4 10 times 8 10 times 8 and here s what i m hoping happens right now i m hoping that you see that both of these strategies can be used to solve multiplication and they re what
b go over here and listen because you were adding you re adding 8 times 10 times 8 that equals 80 okay you meant 30
stuff yeah nah i don t want to waste time but for right now that ll be all right and then thank you the other 10 because 8 times 10 times 8 equals 80 80 and then it s the same thing that down because 8 times 10 equals 80
so we see an 8 times 10 here and we see 10 times 8 2 teacher r these are for that when i said 3 times 2 times 3 then i want to say they have 3 times 3 times 2
if you change this around place for the numbers it s going to be the same as yeah and that works for multiplication and for addition what do you need and subtraction lotion yeah go right ahead okay and for subtraction does it work for subtraction
yeah let s talk about that more cause it actually does not work for subtraction and we can talk about why in a little bit okay but i had for so i have to tell you i m getting super excited about my birthday me 0 my gosh i know the same thing happens to you who gets yes happy thank you
who else gets excited or happy about having a birthday me yeah i get super super excited excited no
okay you my birthday is coming up as you all know cause 0 i put it on the calendar and we re making a pizza and we re going to have a pizza party that you guys earned
and a holiday and 0 my gosh it s going to be like the greatest day in the world it s not going to work okay yeah what chocolate yes so oy vey so now what i want to do is thank you
it shh don t do let s not talk about it now quickly can you please back up a little bit away from the board so other kids can see
s so i want to talk to you about my birthday cause i think you guys generally have some really good ideas and i want to talk to you now about shh you ready okay can somebody read this little story problem i have here well you are going to be here i need to wait until everyone s sitting the right way
why cross your legs please i don t like crossing my legs i don t care if you don t like it you we ll go back to our seats in just a minute and then your legs don t have to be crossed anymore please teacher r is planning a party she bought 17 packs of balloons each packet contains 8 balloons how many balloons did she buy she bought wonderful
i want to talk about just a few of the words in here to make sure that everyone understands all of the words so teacher r is planning a party what does it mean to plan this verb right here it s when to buy plan sort of quiet and hands i saw a hand what does it mean to plan a party it s like to think about the party i like it
no teacher r is still okay good there wait please what s that sweetie really okay good stop that please we don t miss anything it let s go to the next sentence she bought 17 packages of balloons
this word right here bought what is this verb in the present past tense it s the past tense c what is it in the present tense buy bought so we have bought right here it and now right now to buy
good so that means that i already bought i was going to buy i know a lot of side talking going on i don t like it yourself and what about this word here packages packages package when was reading she actually shortened the word to pack and it means the same thing
just cause you guys aren t over here it doesn t mean you don t have to pay attention what is a package it s like a package means like a group of something 0 i like it box a box of things
okay so i bought 17 packages of balloons balloons good each package has 8 balloons in it buy we ve got different strategies that we can use
so who can tell me what is the equation that i need to solve this problem hands how disappointing what is the equation the equation i have 3 smart hands
ooh what s the did you forget what equation means this is equation this is an equation 00 now raise your hand and tell me what is the equation for this one
i need just like 5 more minutes of your attention and then you go to your seats to do independent work way good
end i have 3 strategies that i can use breaking apart array algorithm now i haven t heard your voice in i don t even know like a 100 years
strategy 0 i know i know 10 is 80 10 times 8 gives you 80
8 very good you what is 7 times 8
8 who is sitting down correctly with their hand in the air you can you help us out here 56 did i put you on the spot you all these smart hands i love it
126 close close close 136 i got a strategy that you could break with this a different strategy
yours my strategy is thank you sweetie 4 times 10 and another 4 times 7
i m bringing up both of them i want to go back to your seat with you in a minute when we do independent work and talk about that strategy
you 17 times 8 times the corner 00 stop what will i write down here
7 no it doesn t matter the same thing right here is it 8 times 7 stop please yeah because right there is 7 too well this i broke stop that please i ve broken this up right here across if i break it here then i cut the 8
yeah and the last one is the algorithm which is one item many of you really prefer to use here i m going to set up the algorithm and you guys are going to head back to your seats right after this how many of you show me with hands like this strategy here strategy no you re not so comfortable with it
how many of you have seen it done but you re just not so good at it yet okay watch me as i do it and maybe help me when i ask for help okay 56 so what am i going to write right here 56 6 and i m going to 50 on top you got it buddy i like that on top of
13 8 +5 13 okay yeah so these are our 3 different strategies that we use pretty comfortably maybe not the algorithm yet for multiplication
when i set you free you are going to go to your seats and work independently on page 3 unit 3 here unit 3 page 3 reading so i know some of you are going to be like ahh reading
but if you know that it s just using one of these 3 strategies to solve the problem and if you start i think you ll be all right now listen i don t care which strategy you use but this is what you must have the part i actually forgot a sentence answer answer how many balloons did she buy
no she buyed she bought excuse me turn 136 balloons thank you i need a longer arm
you not she buyed she bought because if we remember the past tense of buy is bought student cause you already bought bought here buy thank you sweetie okay
3 you got it buddy come on please i ll put this chart on the board for you so you can see it i i m learning you can see the names 0
i want you to look at mine
c come on sweetie is the children who are working right away will get their eraser teacher r
yes you can sit either there or there teacher r page oy vey
okay let me see what i can do for you buddy shh off okay
book which one hold on 12nd please teacher r can you tell he and he choose one he and he do not say me not don t do it you metro what does that even mean it s a company okay
anymore 0 i ll be there in a minute i m sorry sweetie continue with your work i want a basketball yes i want the safari one basketball basketball 0 let me just take the baseball okay i like how is remembering her sentences with words
like plus yes add i know thank you very much yes is that no
across can you choose an oyster 0 this ice cream yes good the answer is huh i need you to get started
read you see the numbers and you know we re working on multiplication set up one of the strategies please and i ll come back once you ve started
than and if you look up here on our word wall greater is bigger okay 0 sorry choose one of these and that was fast wow you re all done go to unit one and do anything in unit one
done which strategy do you want to use now breaking apart array or algorithm use ooh the breaking apart one i like that one
honey do you need something up here i can flip it for you we re trying to unfold i m sorry no 4 times 7 28
are you still looking for the page honey you re in unit 5 i m not sure i can do this i actually told you to do this side but you don t know how
ms ruiz bought 13 packages of cups for a big party each package contains 8 cups how many cups did she buy it huh it s the same idea so you need to choose which strategy you want to use
do you want to use breaking apart array or algorithm arrays array okay okay write your equation i want to this is all unfounded teachers all over the country are seeing
you re going to real hard to stay in your seat and get your work done be quiet please okay teacher r you so move to an office if somebody is bothering you yes dear he didn t get it okay so let s choose another one for you
now this right here very good nice like it 16 what numbers excuse me i m talking to right now
16 teacher r do you i ll give you one any teacher r when you asked for mine i told you that i had trouble with the homework you know yes 0 i got the cup later and then i like skipped the numbers and then i got that you get it
work like this it s beautiful like that i love your english
look yes bought to buy i m going to remind you again that my class is right there we hear everything you re saying and we re doing math right now
r yes where are you got it smarty pants when you tell someone double check this answer
right and so if you re going to do the breaking apart strategy so choose something in unit one right now to work on but we don t just sit there
8 no sit down i m still sitting down sit down please i m done sit down please i m done thank you job this one greater than means bigger he s 70 yes 12 is don t say my name
i m working with somebody 60 70 which one are you doing i m on this one you got it smarty pants
72 you got it yeah and this one did you have when i m working with somebody else if you talk to me it s really really rude no okay boys and girls who needs excuse me who needs a couple more minutes to finish
i need more minutes okay when you finish with page 3 you can choose another page in unit one working well and we need to add your ooh brilliant that s perfect
one can you put it away i think is now we re going to start keeping it in here next time wonderful he can choose anything go sit down please this one
hand anything in unit one right now okay numbers 5 plus yeah exactly
it s not 180 degrees what was the category angles it didn t ask you for the degrees that makes the difference the thing is you have to understand what the categories were we re not going to debate it
categories triangles quadrilaterals angles lines what did you angles listen do you understand the difference no on who does understand the terminology
okay 2nd group ms 400 right angle okay
group triangles for 400
angle remember only the person next to her can help her angle let s see all right okay that was for how much
400 okay back to who mouth right angle for 500
better classified by angle angle all right
500 next r lines for 300
okay please be quiet inter what intersecting lines and please when i m asking him i don t want to hear anything else
okay very good 300 good over here
500 line segment you re not supposed to help her segment line what are you saying
so who are we going to call i m going to ask you to move in a few seconds what is a line
job how much was that for 500 all right that s okay
e quadrilateral for 500 yes okay
square what is a square good i like those large numbers
you re next line for 400
again too many people are talking one ray
400 okay s triangles for 300 sides what kind of triangle is that
me yeah you can help her equilateral is that your answer no
answer what is equilateral
what is that saying what is equilateral okay
ms j s group quiet no she didn t get that question she just put a line stop it
ms j please pick a category we ll discuss it in a minute this is not our priority ms j s group who will pick a category what was that
this please stop talking so he can think
points what s the next group
that 200
girls classified by sides
equilateral she said it isosceles guys let s just have fun playing this game before we go to the next one let me just ask something
what equal sides equilateral equal sides next whose turn was it
all right pick one of the categories 100 quadrilaterals you can pick for 200
200 which one
the 2nd one quadrilaterals for 200 what is that he can
t just say it say something what are you saying rhombus okay let s try rhombus see
j lines for 200
lines for 200 what is perpendicular what is perpendicular nice job
that who s next lines 100 100 you re not getting information from
him the person next to you
see how much was that 100 b that s all right angles for 100
that we worked on this yesterday i think talk quiet acute angle
angle perfect someone raise your hand and explain to me what is a vertex
d when you have a protractor and you re trying to figure out what type of angle it is the dot on the protractor you line it up on the vertex so you can tell what angle it is
t 2 angles the end .2 rays 2 rays that what equal the angle someone else 2 lines meet at an end point at what point
the end point this is the vertex where 2 lines meet all right who s next back to triangle for 100
right triangle what is a right triangle go back to that one again
100 someone tell me what scalene is d no equal sides
that the end anyone remember how we re going to remember that scalene means no equal sides where none of the sides are equal n e n e stands for no equal
sides if you look at that are those sides equal no question quadrilateral for 100
s guys stop yelling at her answer rectangle
okay this is what we re going to do now we re going to find the mean mode median and range for everyone s scores talk ms
you this is the group this is ms g s you have 500 500 400 200 200
yourself you re working this by yourself each one ms t s team then all together you re doing all 3 times said i did not say put them all together
i said each team and i wrote each team s amount down their scores
pencil get started how do you find the mean pencil stop writing with markers put that highlighter up right there on my desk mean add them up and divide by 5
very good let s get started for you don t know you re doing each group
one now you have to do each group so go to the next group i don t want to hear anyone telling anyone what to do do what numbers do you see
all you figured out what the mean is no i don t know what it means please stop talking
around stop it stop asking and think about what you re trying to ask and trying to do
out i said think okay back to you i forgot what it means it means you re going to find the average for all your scores do you add them all together 1st and now what do you do amount how many scores do you have all together
4 so you have 4 scores and you re going to divide it here that will give you your mean okay
team okay this is part of it to find your mean you re looking for the average scores on this team you added this but now you have to divide your answer by the number of scores and you have how many scores 4 so you have 4 scores and you need to divide
chart for what s your range yes think stop jumping up so fast and think for yourself
understand how do you find your means once you add them we re doing one team at a time this is one team whose team is this ms
g s what was your when you added them all up what did you get 1000 once you add them all up you have to divide them by how many scores divide do you need your multiplication chart to help you
chart you need this not right now what did you say
ms w don t got no more she doesn t have anymore mode did you finish all 3 teams good that s your mean right let s make sure
you still have to bring that 0 down but you re doing good 0 where s the mean
that very good now you have to find the median what does the median mean in order to find the median 1st you have to put your numbers from least to greatest
what s my next number we re on the 1st one you re right that s okay so from least to greatest what s the next number
5 good for the median you find the number that s in the middle do you know how you find your median here that s the same thing what s the 1st thing you do before you divide i don t know you have to add them up and then you do what
divide divide and that s going to be your median good now how many times will 4 go into 14 without going over look at your 4 times table and see what number times 4 will go into 14
8 times 8 times is one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 times what number is close to 14 in the times table the closest number without going over 12
12 look this is how you use it 3 so you put a 3 right here right now 4 times 3 is what 12
so put a 12 here yes what s your next step this okay so we ve divided now we ve already divided and multiplied and now what do we have to do
subtract no we re subtracting not adding it s 2
do bring down the 0 show the 0 you brought it down now what do we do again what do we have to do
20 4 times what 5 so put the 5 up here what s your next step
5 not plus but times it s 20 so put 20 up here
here have a seat do me a favor and go downstairs and see if you see ms
help now you multiply then subtract have you finished keep following it choice stop saying that stop doubting yourself like that
please move on funny stop if you don t see a mode then you don t write down a mode
mode okay unknown right do you understand this seat i need the mode mode means what
let me go over this again let me stop a minute and go over this information it mean median mode and range median is when we find the average of our scores right
median the middle is please stop talking unless i m talking to you least to greatest we go least to greatest 1st so for example if i was finding the median here what would be my 1st number from least to greatest 200
200 again because i have to use all my numbers 400 500 and 500 again 400 that would be my median for ms
g s someone raise your hand and tell me what the mode is
200 both of those are up there twice so my mode would be 200 and 500 range subtract the lowest number from the highest number numbers 200 and 500
stop talking and stop asking about the restroom when i m asking her about a number 200 500 and 200 i m going to subtract 500 -200 to give me my range okay everyone understand now
all right there s no mode there
do you hear me do you have 40 problems on the test
do you understand that ms j how do you find the range you ve got to remember this understand excuse me quiet are you finished
here i left you and you were doing the same thing changed let s move on
teams where okay you finished you finding it
you know i m coming to some of you almost as if it s the 1st time you ve worked on mean median mode and range now why are you saying that
that i mean basically every time you ve had scores you ve done this some of you are saying you don t know what a range is is we re down to sols next week
we re sitting around like we don t like we re not getting anything and it s because you don t want to do the work work you ve got to value your education students
number 1st let s write them in a row 100 then you have what
200 not subtract but add when you have 2 numbers as your median 1st you add them
again you add them and divide by 2 and that would be your median is the mode 500 500 where s your numbers is that the number you see the most
so what would be your mode 200 and 500
mean how do you find your mean how many scores do you have 5 so what are you going to divide
1st that total you divide by one 2 3 4 5
watch i m going to have some of the students come up and you re going to show us the information have a seat this is ms g s team let me have someone
come up and show me the mean mode median and range here you should be looking here
seat look up here stop writing what are you doing 1st
here what sign goes right here what do you do 1st to find your mean add them you add all the scores and then what do i do
do no talking 1800 then she counted how many scores she had
5 okay so she s going to divide that into 1800
look up here what s 8 -5
360 your mean for ms g should be 360 median the median is what number
mode what does mode mean team okay
circle those for my mode up at the top there okay a subtract the highest from the lowest okay all right
questions someone from ms j s team come up come up
mean it s 100 up what do i do to find my mean
answer 400 +300 +400 +300 +100 1600 okay
what are you dividing one so 6 into what 6 into 16
okay so what s your mean how are you going to write that like just a whole number without a remainder what would you put there instead of a remainder 0.4 okay
266.4 what s your mode
that okay is her median correct mean you didn t get that what do you mean
wait a minute we re laughing over here and talking over here i m not understanding what you re saying what did you get again stop talking please
1600 just listen
you 5 listen carefully 1600 that s what she has 6 then you divide
one 6 can go into 16 2 times 6 is 12 on how many times will 6 go into 40
6 36 subtract bring down the next number attention how many times will 6 go into 40 just go over and over 4
i m going to make this a whole number so the answer should be 266.4 okay so maybe some of you used 100 instead of 200 and maybe that s why you have a different score
maybe that s what happened 1st i did 200 and then when i wrote it up here someone said that was 100 them we re going to stop there today because we have to move on to social studies won team one
what s the problem we ll do it really quick come on up we ve got to move into history we ve got 4 scores
1st listen he s only coming up
team we don t work against each other together let me write the numbers down and then you tell me
500 then what s left i ll let you do the rest and please go outside my door
go outside you have +200
okay when you add you have 1400
mean divide you have 4 scores so you re going to divide what 1400 you need to look up here
down how many times will 4 go into 0 good right your mean should have been 350
t the next part is how would i find my mode mode is the middle number right no most 0 there is no most
talking there is no mode in there because there s just one 201 201 301 400
i already added them
2 you have 2 numbers here so you have to divide by 2 to get your median
you need to put it up here what s your median
now how do i find my range that s the last thing subtract the biggest number from the smallest number so do that what he s doing is rewriting them
he put them in order from least to greatest so he would know what his range is
500 write it the other way just look over there good very good
job does everyone understand now how to find mean mode median and range everyone understand it ms g said basically when you re working with ms
g you re doing the same things over there like she said yesterday she worked on finding mean mode median and range and i m surprised today that we re sitting here struggling with that surprised you need to study this information all right thank you
math you do this with in your head with no calculation on the paper okay number one what number is one less than 750 what what number is one less than 750
add the digits in the current year
sum add the digits in the current year what is their sum number 3 how many ounces in a pound
pound number 4 13 times 10
13 times 10 okay this last one is probably going to be difficult because we ve not talked about this so just put down your best answer and we ll talk about it when we re done
which 3 dimensional shape has no faces
which 3 dimensional face shape . which 3 dimensional shape has no faces i don t know you may not even know any 3 dimensional shapes we didn t talk about that but some of you might know
circle did you say number 4 circle that was 5 all right number 1749749 yes number 2
you said it s . that was add the digits in the current year
0 i saw some confusion on that one when i looked around the room where what s confusing about where you what s happening
sense i added . what numbers did you add 20 and 13 okay and what did you get ooh so your so we refer to the year as 2013
okay so how many people added 20 to 13 like it i you know i did i don t know that what she did was it s wrong because the question says specifically add the digits in the current year and so the digits would just be separated 201 and 3 you add them as digits
66 but so if you missed the key word there in that question was digits
if i just read add the year add the numbers in the year or add the year up what is the current year s sum then i would i can see where you might come up with 33 because we do refer to it as 2013 some people call it 132000 some people just call it 13 . and . did you kind of realize that after
yes when because you were kind of not confident about that so you knew there was something odd about it for paper towels you were in the bathroom playing around
0 ooh red all right how many ounces were in a pound 1616 how many people put 16
0601616 is correct yay 0 60 but is getting upset knowing that 16 ounces is in a pound is a memorization thing you just need to know that 16 ounces is in a pound
fix it s just something these are every day measurements that you re going to absorb as you go as you grow up so not knowing right now we haven t gone over a lot of that we re going over that in the future so if you already know it it s just something you already know
it 13 times 10 i that 3 and i get a 10 what what did you do i put i had 10 times 13 and i do you know that you don t have to multiply in your head would somebody like to tell what she should do next time she s multiplying by 10
what the 131313 to make it what 26130 i was remember i put 320 you re doing it in your head so you can t write it down like i was going to write it on the smartboard head so i m doing 13 times 10 and i m thinking in my head 13 times 10
i just write down 13 and 13 times 100 is 13 times 1000 is that s 30 s yeah it s 3000 so 13 so you forgot your 1300 we don t have to put a comma in the 1000s you don t have to put a comma there
so you re going to see how you need to imprint this on your brain comma and so when a teacher writes 1000 on the board you don t need to tell them that they re that s wrong it s not wrong like that yeah it s not wrong 1000 does not have to have a comma
if you re dealing with in place value or we re talking in math terms then yeah i probably should have put a comma there but when you re looking at a year or you re reading a book and they use the word a 1000 or they use the number a 1000 you re not always going to see a comma in it you anytime you go beyond 10000 you must have the comma in it okay the comma s separating the place value so you know the different periods
so the 1st period is the ones the 2nd period is the 1000s 3rd period is the 1000000s ooh can i do the next one what is it a sphere pronounce it right 0 a sphere sphere a sphere sphere a sphere teacher c i got my answer because you said a 3 dimensional shape no faces and i know that a circle . a circle don t have like no sides or nothing and that s what it remind me of and then that s what i thought of
and then you said 3 dimensional and i put i would think about a cube and stuff and then that s when i said a sphere teacher c before we did it said circle and i wanted to make sure that i corrected that correct a circle s not a 3 dimensional shape it s not 3 dimensional it s flat
it s flat so a sphere is like a sphere is a 3 dimensional version of a circle so if i take a circle and i put it in 3 dimensions that is it s in front of me and around me then it s going to be a sphere not a circle
shh hands in the air
stop put your problem in the middle
why are we doing why . why do let everybody know we didn t do it what yeah what does that mean their yelling prevented you from them yelling doesn t prevent you from knowing what 7 times 2 is
all right get your math notebook out page you re talking
math book we don t have to say things like that when we re doing it just get our math book out and we open it to a blank page and when we re quiet then we get started
i don t know they i had nothing to do with any of this mean i m saying i just didn t she made this promise to people in i assumed that they were collecting that when you walked through the door but you walked in with it so i m just now i guess i should take it because other people gave it to me
i know you shouldn t have it because hopefully they ll make a different color know i don t know if that s only good for one day or what passes all right i want you to on a line write these fractions down
all of them yep the 1st line i want you to write those 5 fractions and what i do when i write fractions is i . you should use your blue line as your divisor line that is the line that this is our divisor line
so your blue line line blue line and then your number and then skip a line number that s how you should write your fractions on your paper from now until you yeah college already has an idea about a good idea
that is giving out her equivalent fraction bar thing that she had that was just it s okay
writing what we re going to talk about today is pants comparing fractions
i say things ahead of time to prevent what you re doing right now more by giving you a forewarning about what i my expectation is i gave you told you what the expectation was when . when this started leaving write them down exactly the way they re written on the board
equivalent okay on the 1st line once you re going with the 1st group 13rd 14th one half 15th 112th put in order from greatest to least
least so you re going to re write them on another line from greatest to least
ooh the top line least top line so a lot of people who were it s like you re ready you re setting yourself up
sharp you ve got everything on your desk neatly now we need to actually start doing the work that we re told to do here okay i did not tell you what to do with the 2nd one
one from greatest i only did the 1st one too i thought the 2nd one was it s okay okay okay so from greatest to least i i do not want people calling my name and holding a book up like that please if i come around and i check on somebody that doesn t mean that i want other people to run over to me and show me
if you want to know if you did this right you ll pay attention when we talk about it okay did so we re going greatest to least on the 1st line
0 what do i have here
i say 2 sixths i m going to have to ask you leave if you can t stop talking desk okay let s make sure i . all right that s so the top lines greatest to least
me ooh work greatest means that it is higher correct
1st denominator we re doing do . that s better yes okay so greatest to least that is the largest number to the smallest number
a fraction is still a number because a fraction is part of a whole go ahead huh in the middle no i want you to do the ones . the ones that have one up there together there s 2 separate ones so greatest to least space you can if you think 12 is the 1st then you bring it down here and bring it there
paper is it did you do you raise your hand raise your hand if this is what you have on your paper did i do i saw other people with this on their paper that don t have their hand up can i i didn t do that all right would someone who doesn t have their hand up like to explain . why this is not 100% correct
w because like say if you have a pizza like if you cut it in 112th it s going to be smaller than a half yeah a half so what you re based on what you re saying listen he s saying that if i was at a party and i had pizza and they offered me 112th of a piece or half of a pizza you would rather have a half of a pizza right
yes because it would be like a skinny piece if it was like split into okay so i love that explanation because basically what here s my pizza if i want one half that means that there are 2 parts to my pizza and i get one of them right yes all right if i want 13rd of that pizza then i got to make it smaller
right that s not exactly the way it should be done but now i ve split it into 3 parts right huh and then 4 parts and then . 12345 parts
101112 so . i like s thinking because he wasn t just thinking about the fraction numbers themselves those people who did it in this order you were looking solely at the denominator and going well the denominator s larger if the denominator so i just went in order
so now we ve got to recognize you 2 that fractions are reversed great this one was pretty easy because it i gave you one once easy in that i can compare these easier because i have the same numerators so those people who put them in the wrong order can we stop that need no no no no
i want you to stop that which means stop what you re doing wrong most of the people did it in the right i need you to see this so you don t do this wrong next time okay no you d rather pick up paper and dig through your desk
too a lot of this is stuff you were supposed to turn in but what and i know where you sit there s a problem sometimes but you need to recognize that sometimes we don t collect what you have me all right who would like to do the next one but before we do that let s put this in the right order
so 112th means i have if i think in terms of my candy bar that we started off with and there s 12 pieces in a candy bar how many did i get one okay 15th doesn t work out with the candy bar because 15th we couldn t break up our candy bar into even fifths it was 12 because there was only 12 but 14th of a 12 piece candy bar is how many pieces
i take 12th well what do i do to 4 to get 12 you multiply it by you multiply it by so then 3 i get 3 pieces for my 14th because 3 sections . 3 pieces in 4 sections that is 333 and 3 add up to 120 if i have 13rd of a candy bar that s right how many pieces do i have
you have 31 it s it s got to be more than 3 pieces if we said this was 3 pieces this has got to be more than 3 pieces that s 2 pieces look again bar remember we had 4 in a row and then 3 across right no it was 4 across and 3 down so our candy bar looked like this
wait 4 in a 2341 bar this is 14th 0 this is 13rd how many pieces is 13rd 4 that s 13rd how many pieces did i get
444 yes i so when i m doing this in order and i m comparing i have to remember that i m comparing the same whole that i m comparing the same whole so s pizza thing works out well because if i . if i do this as a pizza i got 12 slices i only get one out of the same exact pizza now that pizza is 5 slices and i get one
well 5 slices have to be big each slice has to be bigger than 12 slices right yes yes same exact pizza not this is not 12 slices 5 slices 4 slices 3 slices 2 slices of just regular slices half half of the pizza a 3rd of the pizza a 4th of the pizza a 5th of the pizza a 12th of the pizza okay so work greatest to least
i want half of a candy bar of pizza more than i want a 3rd a quarter a 5th or a 12th so what do we notice about the pattern of the denominator when the numerator s the same it . it goes up it goes up so from greatest to least i m going up
from the greatest to the smallest my denominator goes up when my numerator stays the same yes it s okay so this would make it this is more difficult when i want to compare this because i have different numerators i can still do it but i have different numerators
denominator all right who . who can do the next one from least to greatest me hey that s not fair why is it not fair it s not fair that you you re certainly right it s not fair
0 i m not ready yet okay you ve got to come up here and do it right then so all the pressure s on you now you do this wrong and we ll probably not call on you again
greatest you said to greatest i m sorry least to greatest largest to greatest least to greatest why was that so easy
it 234 well that s not the 0 it s not in order just because it says 12345 okay you re right right not just because it s in order but what makes it right
know because . the numerator 1st the denominators are the same so we don t worry about the denominator and the numerator is the least to greatest change your card
yes another brilliant answer say it again because wasn t listening
minute all right listen the numerator the denominator is all the same so don t worry about the denominator and the numerator is least to greatest so with my denominator being the same i m saying that the whole has 6 parts the same whole has 6 parts
so if this was my candy bar that would be 2 pieces all right and 16th would be i have 2 pieces 26th 4 pieces 3 sixths 6 half half of 6 and 3 sixths is half 4 sixths i have 8 pieces did it work
yeah it was just a mistake on the test and you were . you know if it were me that was and if they told us to send in the results then it would have been different but she was doing that so it was her and i don t . you know i don t if she s going to do it then i want her to see that mistake and recognize it because that s going to happen to a lot of other you re probably not the only person that it happened to
0 but you didn t bring me any so change your card i didn t i m just kidding all right so congratulations and thank you for next time i call or i don t call on you let s not get upset about it because i can t call on everybody and when i pull sticks you know sometimes we don t get a response
said ignoring the denominator because it s the same makes everything else fall right into place
order all right get out your . keep out your notebook get out that equivalent fractions notebook page that we had
fractions i i didn t remember how we treat these to do not pick this up
it if they fall out on the ground i will take it from you okay treated who did i take it away from yesterday
up you have everything yeah wrong place yeah okay teacher c
teacher c fall i i know i know
okay i m going to give you 5 more fractions except this time . this time . this time you re going to use them . the fraction bars again
the rest of you who are taking them out when teacher c passes them out and asks you not to take them out this is why me put it back in it so i should not hear the sound of the bar back into it you don t need to remove the bar for what we re going to do necessarily although it might help
set they keep on talking which one was the easiest to do both one s got to be easier than the other the 2nd one teacher c the 2nd one why was the 2nd one easier because all you had to do was . all you had to do was put in number order all you had to do was put it in number order because of what because it was you had the same what
denominator i just said something that well a lot of people weren t listening to that has everything to do with what our lesson is supposed to be about today the reason that the 2nd one was easier and most of you should agree with that that s my tape
please the reason that the 2nd one should be easier is because all you had to do was use your . use your skills that you re already good at of comparing whole numbers by the same denominator i m just comparing my numerators numbers so when i put my fractions all in with the same denominator raise your hand
vote how many of you think that i could take every one of these fractions up here and you d have the same denominator with them that i could make equivalent fractions of all of those fractions and have one denominator so that i could compare them easily because that was a lot easier raise your hands if you think i can change the denominators of all those to the same exact denominator
this is why you all need to stop talking and you need to pay very close attention because there s only 3 people in here who have any idea what we re going to do today so you need to open up your mind to know that i can change a denominator to anything i want and if i get all of my denominators the same if i have all 6 s as my denominator all i do is compare my numerator
a 100 i m not saying that we re i m not asking you what the numerator is i know but so put this in order from greatest to least and then we ll look at how we can make it easier because we re the 1st group was 14th 13rd
one we ve now got to realize that we re going to be comparing fractions that have different numerators and denominators tiles yes every one of these has fraction is on your fraction tiles
thank you so you may be able to you may need to remove them to compare them are we going to greatest to least or to . we re going greatest to least okay i know what i would do if it were me
i see s thinking like me hey you can t cheat why can t well he s not cheating
0 so you use the . greatest to least that s not right no that is right okay ooh i thought 2 fifths come before 16th i mean 15th 6th 0 it goes yeah see
0 yeah how come you because i dropped it doing you have your sheet that has the same thing that i have you can use that
yay now see i can compare them now because i know i have the same exact whole i m comparing the same whole
together together okay 0 say can shh
remember guys i also gave you some hints about your grid quick where is my guys i m ask i m asking for a brief moment of time look we talked about the grid yesterday
when i give you the grid paper for the s 0 l you can write your multiplication facts right but look you can make a fraction bar on that yeah i you could by counting what is the whole how many squares would you make the whole 20 right well then one half of 20 is 10 okay
that although it s not as easy as you think i will develop a system that we can use to make our faction bars on our on our chart on your chart i made one i would do 30 because 30 could be divided by 3 halves i by sixths okay so once you get it set up on your desk now line them up in order from greatest to least
i 2 thirds 2 . 2 thirds all right what s next 2 fifths i mean 0 all right but when you put these together what do you notice that . they re equal they re equal did you use your fraction bars
you think you got it in order correctly i already know i got order all right all right guys we got to speed this up because we re running out of time me
t he said when you grow up and you got 24 names and 2 of them begin with ty you ll learn that you sometimes will make a mistake that doesn t matter same excuse me
t all right so she has 2 thirds as the greatest
huh so that while s up here what should you be doing everybody to see did she get it right or wrong right or wrong comparing what she s doing to what you did
lap so she started off with have a seat i d appreciate it when i give you opportunity to learn that you take it you it tells me that you sat there while your neighbor did this correctly there do you not understand that green is smaller than orange
that green is smaller okay you had 42 others to put out there and you don t have them out there so there s no excuse for you coming up here and not knowing
air they all know the answer because they did the activity s i don t you got to bring your notes with you
that she got with 4 sixths okay do you think 2 thirds is bigger no 4 sixths and 2 thirds shh shh shh shh you put your order up you do your order that you did and then we ll talk about what you did
all right is this correct yes yes she s got 2 thirds 4 sixths 0 yeah that s right yes all right what did you notice about 2 thirds and 4 sixths when you put the fraction tiles next to each other what did you notice
2 thirds and 4 sixths they same but the thirds is bigger than the sixths all right i like her thinking and 2 thirds and 4 sixths were equivalent but the tiles there was 2 tiles versus 4 tiles
yeah so a 3rd is actually larger than a 6th so in order and it really didn t matter if she put 4 sixths or 2 thirds but she had a reason why and this is what i ve been trying to get across to a lot of people about math something do you always have to yeah that s part of math is reasoning
so the reason why she put 2 thirds 1st and probably correctly was that if she compares a 3rd to a 6th 13rd is bigger than 16th i m up here i don t appreciate when i m speaking that you re making faces
off what i like to see are people s eyes on the smartboard processing information that they re learning for the 1st time seat put it back put your fraction tiles back . without talking
now we re going to learn a little bit about what s called common denominators common denominators are denominators that fractions can share i find what s called the least common denominator so that i can prove you proved at your seat that this order was correct you proved it by comparing the size of the tiles
again i want you to notice that you are comparing the same whole that is 2 thirds 4 sixths 5 twelfths 2 sixths and 3 tenths made up the same exact whole so if i have 3 thirds 6 sixths 12 twelfths 5 fifths and 10 tenths all of that would be even it s not that difficult to do this without dropping them
let s take our time and care all right go ahead and stop what you re doing even if you don t have a i want you to look up here these tiles will go back in ready so i want to find the least common denominator because as i showed you earlier comparing numbers fractions with the same denominator is the same as comparing numbers
so if you know that 30 is greater than 20 then having a least common denominator ability will make comparing fractions easy pizza so this is the 1st thing i do to find the common denominator i need to find a number that all 5 of these numbers when multiplied will give me
so i need to find a number that when i multiply 12 i get the same number when i multiply something by 5 skip counting i m going to start with the largest number
1212 i m going to go 12 2436364848486070 i m going to stop at 60 60 yay now i m going to go to 10102020304050607080 why am i going to stop at 60
because 60 because 60 because 60 into 12 and you don t want to go over it i don t want to go i took the largest number that i have . the you get back to your seat
i took the . i take the largest denominator that i have i take the largest denominator that i have and i start finding a common denominator with that because it s the largest number
and every number after that you know when i skip count by 3 s i m going to have 12 24 36 but i m not going to be able to necessarily get all the other numbers 10 a factor of 10 every time so my common denominator has to be 60 now
you could do 5 now i could skip count by 5s all the way to 60 but that s going to be a long time so i m going to have to do it anyway
51015202530354045505560 so we got 60
6010 so i m just going to go 2 times 6 plus times 10 is 60 yah 6 times 10 is 60 all right is half of 6 so that means i got to multiply it by twice as much to get it so what do i multiply by 3 to get 60
23 times 21234567891011125 times 12 is 60 what do i multiply by 10 to get 60
66 so if i multiplied 3 times 20 get 60 what do i have to multiply by 2 think i don t need you to 30 we don t need to do this can you please go back to your seat 60 so i multiplied 3 times 20
now i ve got 60 as my common denominator so i m going to write 606060 is going to have 60 as their common denominator i need eyes on the smartboard and i need people to stop staring at someone sitting at a desk
okay what did i multiply times 3 to get 60
by 20204010 i mean not 10202030 if i multiplied this 3 by 20 to get 60 and i multiplied this i multiply this 2 by 20 i ve multiplied 2 thirds by 20 over 20 which is the same as one so i ve not changed the value of 2 thirds any by multiplying it by 200 i m just creating an equivalent fraction
22 times 4040 what did i multiply time 6 to get 10 what 4040 equivalent fractions 40406060 what do i multiply times 12 to get 60
by 5 what did i multiply 55 to get 12 so what did i multiply by 1212 teacher c you put 25 right there yeah 55 times 5 is 25
what 245 times 12 60 is you should have noticed when you put 5 twelfths . 5 twelfths next to 2 fifths that you could barely tell the difference because they re only that much off 60 what do i multiply by 36 and what is it
18 so we confirmed and proved by finding the least common denominator of 60 that the order that we saw with our fraction strips was correct and we confirmed that 4 sixths and 2 thirds were equivalent fractions yup you should have some of you should have i did this on purpose because i wanted to see with 5 twelfths and 2 fifths how many people would get those mixed up
because when you re doing the bars there s very little space that 5 twelfths is barely a tiny bit bigger
our 1st attempt at this we got the orders reversed because we looked at the the denominator and said well 12 is bigger than 5 which is bigger than 4 which is bigger than 3 which is bigger than 2 does everybody here understand that i don t compare fractions by comparing un like denominators yes yes you cannot compare a fraction unless you have fraction strips to an unlike denominators yes you cannot compare a fraction unless you have fraction strips to an unlike denominator
you ve got to have the same denominator and you don t do that and you can make so let me see a raise of hands could i find a common denominator among these 5 fractions hands asked that question only 2 of you raised your hands
now it becomes a matter of recognition a matter of memory that you if you can remember these steps and remember this idea you ll be able to create . common denominators so that you can compare your fractions all right write this fraction down
when i ask you to make a number sentence out of that what am i asking you to do
do is it the okay and what do we call that the greatest less and equal not equal greater less than
to that s greater than 2 thirds 2 thirds is . probably greater than i like that he said probably yes thirds can he prove it using fraction strips denominator yes you don t have to you don t have to find a common denominator but if you don t have fraction strips what are you going to do
you re going to have to i . i just remember . i when i saw you do it i already knew the answer i i didn t even look at 2 thirds 2 thirds it s they re too close in size for you to say confidently which one s greater than the other
sense yes greater you might be right but you don t want to rely on what you think
all eyes and ears on me please so i don t have to take all individual questions it and i am wearing a microphone so it can record everything i say and probably also pick up on what you guys are saying
come sit down please thank you for your hand room yes
probably everything that we re doing and saying right now is being recorded
0 it s not about the cameras but it s about math okay great we use a pattern block template wait a moment please so technically yes and we re not going to talk about the cameras or the mic anymore
okay please get your notebook out shh boys and girls i need to hear complete silence in here and i need to see people remembering to raise their hands yes
were you supposed to draw the hexagon were you supposed to draw the hexagon and draw the beside it idea and what is the for
i ll go over that in a 2nd put your book away
now okay that s fine put the book away so if a hexagon is our whole what fractions are represented by the trapezoid the rhombus and the triangle and i reminded to think back to what we were doing yesterday when we were modeling the different fractions i saw you drew your picture
can you tell me what fraction of the hexagon one trapezoid is 3rd could you would it take 11 what 11 part out of how many parts 3 parts so 012nd okay what do we call that one part out of how many parts altogether one half one half
good so one half if we re talking about the hexagon as our whole one trapezoid equals one half and what fraction of the hexagon is one rhombus hands raised please
k one half if the trapezoid is one half could a rhombus be one half of the same shape yes take a step back the other way k it would be 13rd 13rd and how did you figure that out
my mind because if you like i guessed there we have a rhombus yeah and then this is a triangle even though it s a triangle you have another rhombus here and then you take away this line and that s okay so how many rhombus s would it take to cover the hexagon
3 so one rhombus is 13rd one part of the 3 equal parts altogether l okay just a 2nd have a seat please sit down back put all of them back
j we re going to talk about those because we had some problems yesterday with people using them in ways that weren t helping us with our math so a rhombus is 13rd of the hexagon n
talk put them back put them back a triangle is what fraction of the hexagon you so how many triangles would we have to use to cover that hexagon
can you remember from yesterday or kind of visualize how many triangles it took to cover the hexagon out 66 why is the denominator of this fraction 6 okay why is the denominator 6
the denominator tells us how many equal parts or groups we ve divided the whole into so it would take 6 triangles to cover the hexagon
okay so today for all of the problems that we re doing the hexagon is going to be one whole we re going to pause for a moment here and talk about how we re using the pattern blocks distracted it felt a little more like recess in here than math time pencil down please
down so remind me of some things that we can do both to share our materials and to help us keep focused on learning as we work with the pattern blocks i know yesterday we ran out of triangles and people were going from table to table to take triangles what could we have done instead of going and taking triangles that somebody else was using to try and solve their problem
e where was i
e 0 yes
idea eyes over here okay so wait until the materials that you want to use are available do do a different problem go on to another problem that doesn t require all of the triangles
do or if someone is doing the same problem as you and they have enough of those pattern blocks to do it you could just work with them excellent idea i love that that s one thing i thought of yesterday maybe it would have been better if instead of each of us trying to work individually which i know that you like to do
but sometimes it s nice for us to be working in groups and talking with each other about what we re doing and sharing our materials j head some people are able to do it in their head also did you have an idea okay on the inside there i wanted to move on and work on the problems
j so i m going to be watching today if i see that you re not using the materials to do the math problems that we re supposed to be working on then i m just going to ask you to take a time out at the rug because this is definitely learning time
the other thing is when i ring the bell please show me right now what you need to do things it s very tempting when we have all of these materials in front of us to keep working thinking but every now and then we need to come together as a class and listen to each other
and right now it looks like you guys are ready to do that so i appreciate it the 1st thing that i m going to ask you to do will you please get a basket of pattern blocks for your table one grab one
one do not touch them ahead yes
group just like i told you yesterday if you haven t learned this before we re all learning this together it s new information for everyone not just for you or for everyone and our voices are still off
fine i just have to try to avoid bumping it against everything okay so the 1st thing i need you to do when i say go and not until i say go i want you to get one trapezoid one rhombus not until i say go sit down and triangle and make a hexagon
go ahead are we peacefully sharing yes we are
m and let me see it we didn t need a hexagon did we
flat okay thank you shoulders just a 2nd please okay so the reason i wrote number model on the bottom of the white board is because we took a hexagon or excuse me
not a hexagon a trapezoid a rhombus and a triangle and we added them together to form a hexagon now we need to write a number model to describe what we did using fractions okay can somebody think of a fraction number model to describe what we just did
k one half one half 16th +13rd okay equals a whole a whole or we re also going to call it 111 half +16th +13rd equals one okay
we are going to use the pattern blocks today to model some different addition and subtraction problems with fractions the 1st one i m going to demonstrate for you is going to be 2 thirds +16th i m going to use these steps here all hands empty i need to see your eyes
eyes hands empty here so step one is to use pattern blocks to model the fractions to be added sum what does combine mean
mean combine means to bring together put together good or what s another math word that we sometimes associate with combine go ahead like if you add something add combine and add
adding trade for one kind of bluff for example if we have some rhombus s some trapezoids we might want to trade them all for a fair and equivalent number of triangles
that so for the problem 2 thirds +16th can somebody remind me of what our 3rd is if the hexagon is the whole m the . the rhombus good
m how do you know that rhombus is 13rd because 3 rhombus s fit into the whole which okay it takes 3 rhombus s to cover the hexagon which is our whole right now
what is our half if our hexagon is our whole one if you split which shape is half of a hexagon how many triangles does it take to cover the hexagon
a hexagon 0 a hexagon 666 triangles please stop dropping in your chair so a triangle one triangle is 16th of a hexagon one half stand up and push your chair in and stand for a few moments
chair which shape is one half of a hexagon the rhombus the rhombus is 13rd not the rhombus the trapezoid thank you the trapezoid is one half of the hexagon how many trapezoids does it take to cover the entire hexagon
to cover the hexagon 22 okay so we have a denominator of 2 if we re talking about how many trapezoids cover the hexagon a denominator of 3 if we re talking about how many rhombus s cover the hexagon and a denominator of 6 if we re talking about how many triangles cover the hexagon
so our 1st addition problem is going to be 2 thirds +16th i m going to model this one for you and then you guys will have a chance to try some other ones using the same process 2 thirds +16th if i m trying to add 2 thirds step one is use pattern blocks to model the fractions to be added
what pattern blocks do i need to get to model 2 thirds what do i need to get to model 2 thirds flat you need to get a triangle 2 thirds which of our pattern blocks represents 13rd of the hexagon okay what s the fancy math name for that
okay how many rhombus s do i need to make 2 thirds 22 rhombus s 2 rhombus s is 2 thirds so i m still doing step one here
use pattern blocks to model the fractions to the why don t you come sit on the please and i ve got my 2 rhombus s what do i need to model 16th 2 sixths what do i need to model just 16th of a hexagon
6 which pattern block do i need to model 16th of the hexagon you a triangle okay so we have 2 thirds +16th i did step one
use pattern blocks to model the fractions to be added step 2 sum so i m trying to see what fraction of the whole i m making right now so i m trying to combine
off just a minute follow directions push your chair in there thank you that s better follow directions
you re fine all right so 2 thirds +16th i put my blocks together to show the sum or what they ve looked like when i ve combined them block if i have one rhombus what s a fair trade what kind of pattern blocks could i trade for that rhombus how many triangles 11 triangle is that a fair trade
no wait how many for one rhombus what would be a fair trade in triangles for one rhombus don t touch no
now please just keep your hands on your shoulders i need you to follow along for this example and then you will have the chance to do it 22 okay 12 triangles equals one rhombus right okay so i had 2 rhombus s and a triangle and i m going to trade the rhombus s for triangles
so that rhombus i ll trade for 2 triangles this rhombus i ll trade for 2 triangles triangle let me put them back together to see how much of the whole i have so 2 thirds +16th trade for one kind of block i did that
please 2 thirds +16th equals here let me see 2 thirds +16th equals what
here 5 triangles 5 triangles what fraction does that represent when our hexagon is a whole right yep so altogether they equal 5 sixths 5 sixths i knew it
it s just like 16th +16th +16th +16th +one more 6th equals 5 sixths do you see that 2 thirds +16th is the same thing as adding all of these individual sixths together
yes okay it s easy
shoulders thank you very much and yep it can hear you and it can see you hands empty when you re playing with pattern blocks i don t think you re listening very well
the 1st one you guys are going to try on your own is 13rd +one half what is our 1st step going to be sorry i m going to wait a 2nd until all please get in your chair before i fall on top of you
you is to be use pattern blocks to model fractions to be added thank you very much so our 1st problem is going to be 13rd +one half p you don t have to guess
steps combine the blocks to show the sum okay and what is our whole for all of these problems everyone one hexagon one hexagon let s say that again because that was only everyone one hexagon thank you okay so we re going to combine those shapes to show the sum
a name the with them just said we re going to combine the blocks to show the sum you and then what s our last step in the problem
mean sum means the total the total in what kind of problem sum 13rd +one half you may quietly work on that one together
write your work in your math journal please and then we re going to stop and share solutions in a few minutes
what you thought about okay 13rd +one half so what is okay
have a seat empty hands do you know leave those for a 2nd very quickly
empty hands thank you table thank you to everyone at s table d could you please go this way so you don t bump into the camera seat let s see here
and can you 2 show us how you solve this problem what was that can i bring my own that s okay you can borrow our hands our empty now k leave them alone you don t need them right now
let s listen to your classmates please triangle nobody needs triangles right now except for and empty you re listening to your classmates the same way you would want them to listen to you
let s clear this out of the way
thank you very much
okay somebody else who did something differently did you do it differently come on up
okay so each triangle is 16th thank you
5 sixths try
again raise your hand if you feel like you ve got this okay i see a lot of hands are not raised what can you use to help you if you re not getting it
solve the steps in the problem and what is step one
okay so what is come here i cannot come here i do not want to hear or see anyone touching pattern blocks when we re talking come on
you need to you can do a lot better step one use pattern blocks to model the fractions to be added how would you model 5 sixths 5 sixths you would put 5 triangles
5 triangles please move over so modeled 5 sixths for us okay 5 sixths +plus what
+13rd which shape please get in the chair which shape is 13rd say it again the what s the math name for it okay so 5 sixths +13rd please sit down now
your eyes are up here paying attention you 5 sixths +13rd what is our next step
number 2 number 2 combine the . combine the blocks to show the sum okay sum the only way i can really think of to do this is to put them like that that doesn t really help me visualize it
now trade for one kind of block trade for one kind of block what do we need to do next trade since you didn t trade the triangles that s right
good thinking you have to trade the rhombus for 2 triangles because 2 triangles equals one rhombus okay m so we take the rhombus and we trade it may i okay trade the rhombus for 2 triangles
now we have a hexagon and one triangle what s one way to name that fraction what s one way to name that fraction
one and 51 and one because we made a whole right l one whole one and 16th that s one way to name the fraction what s another way to name the fraction
7 sixths 7 sixths we also used 7 triangles and we know that each triangle is 16th so that would be 7 sixths 5 sixths +13rd equals 7 sixths i think we need to try another one of these and i ll have to make one up for you
let s try 5 sixths +2 thirds 5 sixths +2 thirds those of you at the rug please go try this one
would you please try to follow the steps and i m going to come back and check on you
5 sixths +2 thirds yes you know what i haven t been over to this side of the room at all i need to go over here and 0 no it s okay it s not important please go and solve the problem
problem what are you looking for
was it easier yes
okay we re listening right now started we re not going to argue about the triangles please sit down
me why don t they just go work with somebody else m 2 sit down now with empty hands i see getting ready to listen i see not quite ready to listen
our hands are empty hands are empty please listen see if you agree with how they solved the problem now i m making a i m sorry one more 2nd
ready respectful listening is ready
rug please stop touching can you explain what you re doing as you re doing it please what are you doing right now
guys i have got your workbooks remember workbooks remember that i had you turn in your workbooks as you finished them last week and that is something we are going to do
we are going to check that workbook page and look at 2 other daily grades that you guys did for review because what do we have tomorrow
test so we are going to finish checking the workbook page and take a look at those 2 review sections that you did in textbook page 262 i believe
then we are going to look at those all together and see what areas we are still struggling with and see if we can do more practice problems with those and then i have got a review sheet for you that has some problems that are like in word story problems because this test remember last week
test it is going to be hard it is going to be harder than your other tests and the reason it is going to be harder is because there are some word problems and it is the way they are worded and what they are asking you for can be a little tricky so i have got this review sheet that is going to help you with that okay all that amounts to is thinking before you start writing and then you should be okay
the 1st thing i want to do is get these sheets returned to you
here guys you should not be sharpening pencils now that
class do not lose these because i still need to put these grades in the computer but i want you to see them now okay textbooks open them up to page 262
i want you to take a look and see what kind of problems those were that you missed take a look and see what kind of problems you missed people we do not need to talk to open up our textbooks
okay so take a look at those missed look to see what kind of problems they are because as i said i am going to be asking you later on in class which ones you still need help with
yes they do not have a grade on them i know because i have not put them in the computer yet 12 and if you missed one you got 92
83 if you missed one or 2 or 0 you are in really good shape
67 so i am going to give you a 2nd paper d i got yours graded but nobody else is
i will check that in a little bit
paper okay right this is again page 262 set d you had to do one 10
number 11 half is greater than 2 sixths number 22 thirds is equal to 4 sixths number 35 and 5 sevenths is less than 6 and 3 fifths
number 42 and 5 sixths is less than 3 and 2 fourths number 57 and 4 eighths is equal to 7 and 2 fourths what do you know about 4 eighths and 2 fourths guys
j they are both one half exactly they are both one half and since they both have the whole number that makes them equal number 6 these you had to put in order from least to greatest and again what do i tell you to do put an l and a g so you do not get them confused and put them in the opposite order because would they be marked wrong then
yes even if you had them in the correct order but you put them in order from greatest to least instead of least to greatest unfortunately people that would be wrong
not putting the right fractions if you did not put the original fraction that they gave you in the book say yes sometimes we have to change these to common denominators to solve the problem but you have to go back and list them with the original fraction
number 82 and a 4th can you see 2 and 4 sixths 3 and 2 twelfths you know this is the largest because look at the whole numbers
denominators number 12 fifths one and 12 eighteenths one and 8 ninths put the number wrong at the top of the paper please
yes for some reason i put 2 eighths when it was supposed to be 2 fifths you mean you copied it down wrong then it is wrong unfortunately
this now what you need to do with this paper guys is look at the 1st 5
5 compare that with the number that you may have missed out of the 2nd 5 problems 6 10 because obviously looking at the 1st 5 that is comparing fractions deciding if the 1st one is greater to the 2nd on or the 1st one is less than the 2nd one or if the 1st one is equal to the 2nd one
then the 2nd 5 are taking the 3 mixed numbers or the 3 fractions and mixed numbers and putting them in a particular order greatest so look to see where you missed the majority of your problems
is it comparing ordering or if you have about an even number wrong of both sections write both but clearly if you only missed one out of this section and maybe 2 out of this one then write down ordering
with now look at set c
c you either had to change an improper fraction to a mixed number or a mixed number to an improper look at the ones that you missed and determine where you had the majority of your problems
you are going to write down mixed improper or you would write down improper to mixed
obviously yes do you still put both yes both okay
do you feel comfortable knowing where your problem areas are okay all right now the last thing that we need to check on is this workbook page
we are going to put grades on those later i know many of you are asking about your grades on your paper later what is more important right now is that you know which ones you missed and what kind of problems that you missed

being
does everybody have their workbook who does not have their workbook who does not have that workbook page finished do it is still in review
13.6 it was the odds right pen that was a daily grade
that if you have trouble with this honey skip this part and go with these be really careful on your next review because that is your computation ones
it can be easy a or it could be okay
13.6 remember this had that great number line last week that yes when you actually learned and you saw for yourself on the number line that a 100th is smaller than 110th lesson yes that was kind of fun to do because you were all totally confused were not you
then i could see on your little faces the light bulb went on
go number one 0.2 you had to write a decimal and a fraction 4 and 12 hundredths and 4 and 320 fifths you have to have both of them to get credit
r when you went to the clinic that day too okay
are number 3 0s is 4 and 7 tenths and the fraction mixed number is 4 and 7 tenths
okay what was this one before we got 4 and 320 fifths 4 and 12 hundredths but then we had to simplify it this 14 and 7 tenths is already in simplest form
yes number 4 oops sorry number 5 since we are doing odds 4 and 9000s and again it would be 4 and 49 fiftieths in simplest form
form that is our 5th grade rule now has been for several weeks number 7 not years because you were not experts at that last year experts okay
it number 7 you were supposed to write a fraction or a mixed number in simplest form
number 7 it is 2 tenths but simplest form would be 15th number 94 and 75 hundredths the simplest form would be 4 and 3 fourths number 11 you were supposed to write a decimal for each fraction or a mixed number
they give us the fraction 12 hundredths so that would be 2 places past the decimal and there you go if you did not put the 0 in front do not mark yourself wrong for that you have to have a decimal and you have to have 2 places after that number 139 tenths would look like this one place after the decimal point
number 15 again we are comparing fractions greater than less than or equal to number 151 half is less than 12 hundredths are you all right wait a minute it is 112th but that is less than 12 hundredths you said one half did i say one half
sorry i meant to say 112th is less than 12 hundredths 12 hundredths is that what you said
yes well 12 divided by what would be one one flip it into multiplication
96 it is close number 174 ninths is less than 5 tenths think about it guys
what one half right compare that to 4 ninths what is half of 94.5 and 4.5 would be less than 5 if you want to look at it that way it is not completely accurate but number 19 mixed review
428 number 2168 and 7 tenths
123556 number 27 14346
number 29 305975 page i am curious
hands 19 29 mixed review how many of you got them all correct yay very good okay
good all right again look at the other problems and look at number 7 10 you had to write a fraction or a mixed number in simplest form
missed was it the ones that you had to write did you miss it because you did not put it in simplest form yes okay
okay raise your hand if you feel now if you just out of 10 problems missed one then i would say you understand the majority of your work now if out of 10 problems you missed 4 or more you are probably going to need some more work
raise your hand if you think you need additional work with comparing fractions greater than less than equal
okay raise your hand if you think you need more work on ordering fractions putting them in order from greatest to least or least to greatest okay raise your hand if you think you need help with changing a fraction to a decimal
this you may have a fraction of 4 tenths decimal yes the tenths tell us we have one place right
tenths what if you have this for a fraction 3 sevenths do we have a place value with our decimals that is called sevenths no so what would you do then
7 again the denominator becomes the dividend the denominator becomes the divisor remember or you think of it like this you write down top to bottom 3 divided by 7 and again what are we going to have to do here to solve it
point how many 7s in 30 28 add another 0 bring it down 20 divided by 7 2 subtract
0 how many sevenths in 60 without going over 8 again we would have 4 this could go on but could we at least get a 2 digit decimal be round it
what hundredths by dividing right sometimes you can look at the denominator and then it is pretty easy to make that decimal process you need to divide right
questions okay would you like to work on this review of the word problems no yes who can remember what i said was going to be tricky on this test
d the word problems why the word problems worded now let me ask you again would you like to practice some of these yes again these are not going to be the actual problems but they are going to be ones similar to the test okay
those 2 papers that you have set d and set c put them in your hands put them right on top of workbook page 13.6 in your workbook
workbook set this to the side
today that way you will not lose them
i am going to work with some of you over here at the table with these give you some extra help with the reading of the problems and you all should really get out a highlighter
up did you get those problems all finished did you have any trouble with them the 1st part with the number line that is the part that they had trouble with but i will help you with that later because that was the trickiest part of that page does everybody have a paper
did i miss anyone what i will let you do is work in groups around the room if you want to go sit on the floor and work in groups
that i am going to have some of you people come over here to the table with me to come sit with me please
come have a seat i was doing a lot of review in my math book over the weekend but with changing fractions to decimals i still have a bit of trouble with that
board divide that is what you have to think about divide my mom had me do the evens on that page the extra practice and the test okay see why do not you come over here with me sweetie i am going to steal some of these chairs
okay all right you all ready guys as you are working in groups some of you are choosing to work on your own
that is fine but if you are working in groups let me remind you that guys are you listening cooperate let us review the group rules
you need to cooperate you need to make sure that everybody agrees all right prior to that agreement you need to make sure everybody understands how you are arriving at your answer everybody needs to work it out in paper or on the worksheet 1st
that then if you see that your answers do not agree with one another talk about it as a group it is not going to help anybody if one person does all the work and you all just copy it you will not have that person to copy from on the test tomorrow will you
go joe is working a puzzle book which has 15 puzzles so how many puzzles are there all together 15 he is finished 4 puzzles what fraction of the puzzles does he have left to finish
this just in reading this problem what do you think would be the tricky part yet think about just the reading and the meaning here
what do you think some kids may get mixed up on just in reading this problem c have left to finish why would that be tricky for them
because the question asks us what is a fraction of the problem that he has left to finish
c it says i think it would be confusing because kids might write down 4 fifteenths says kids may write down 4 fifteenths instead of reading it says that he finished 4 puzzles out of 15
picture could you draw something that represents a puzzle something easy like an x could you make 15 xs to start with
puzzle count them
15 okay a he is finished 4 puzzles
them now read the 3rd sentence
what portion of the puzzles does he have left to finish does it say what fraction of the puzzles has he finished or what fraction of the puzzles does he have left to finish 2 very different ideas there right
finished they want to know how many he has left to finish now if you were not careful you could have just written down 4 fifteenths and that tells us what
how many he has already finished what fraction does he have left to finish 11 fifteenths 11 fifteenths can we simplify that is a good thing to look for
can we simplify 11 fifteenths what do you think
11 is not it one of those special numbers what makes it special it is odd but then you have got to figure when you go through a number line every other number is odd that is half the numbers are odd and half the numbers are even
that does not really make it special what makes 11 special nothing can go into it
which means it is composite opposite prime it only has one and itself as factors right 11 is 11 a factor of 15
no so is 11 fifteenths in simplest form now 2 haley has a recipe to make brownies the recipe has one half cup of chocolate syrup
guys 5th graders there is a problem i am all the way on the other side of the room and yet the people especially the people in is group down there on the floor i am hearing you as clearly as if you were standing right beside me what would cause me to be able to hear you as if you were standing right beside me
loudness yes i am working with these students over here at the table me i want you to use whisper voices or very low tones
brownies the recipe needs a half a cup of chocolate syrup she only has a 3rd a cup and a 4th of a cup measured
down she has a 13rd cup and a 14th cup measured cups can we put one.5 cups of chocolate syrup no
it says right here she has half a cup of chocolate right the recipe needs a half a cup of chocolate is that what you are asking about the next sentence says she only has a 13rd cup and a 14th cup measured how many of you have watched your parents or helped your parents make cookies at home
when you make cookies you can not just start dumping things in a bowl right correctly when you measure things you have to put them in measuring cups and those measuring cups have labels on them do not they there is one with 14th 13rd one half one cup okay cups it says one of them is a 13rd cup
i am going to put 13rd under one measuring cup and the other one is a 14th cup measure need a half a half a cup she she has to use one of these 2 other measuring cups
use this is a real life situation me maybe i used crisco is it comes in a container
butter i measured out peanut butter in my one half cup measuring cup now now i need to measure out half a cup of chocolate syrup it i have to use a measuring cup
4th which one of those am i going to use to measure out a half a cup 3rd if i fill up the 13rd measuring cup how far am i going to fill it up to get one half think
you could fill it up half of the way but what is half of a 3rd we do not know what half of a 3rd is do we more one half or 13rd 13rd one half
one half cup of chocolate syrup would not even fit into 13rd of a measuring cup would it what what do you think now you could fill it up halfway in the 14th we would only fill it up halfway
if i filled up a 14th cup measuring cup half way i would only be filling it 18th would that be accurate though okay what have we been learning about comparing fractions what do we have to do sometimes in order to compare fractions
change the denominator so that there are common denominators now look at the one half cup of chocolate syrup 4th which one would be a friendly fraction to use think of your common denominators
which measuring cup would be easier to use 13rd or 14th
use 14th now 14th is equal to one half is equal to how many fourths 2 times what equals 4 2 so we are multiplying the one times 2 and what do we get 2 so one half equals how many fourths
2 so we have a measuring cup that is 14th syrup we are going to pour it into the measuring cup and that will just be 14th though right then what are we going to have to do
need 2 fourths so we pour the chocolate syrup in the 14th measuring cup once that is 14th
do fill it up again and that would be 2 fourths which is the same as one half here it says which of the following shows an equivalent haley can use for measuring the syrup
5 twelfths 3 fourths 2 fourths 2 thirds 2 fourths there you go sense yes that is a good question because that is a real life cooking question
number 3 this is just a sampling of some of the more difficult ones similar which of the following numbers is equivalent to 3 fourths
side now you see that you have 4 choices here and they are all what
decimals decimals do we need to do a lot of math here to look at this fraction 3 fourths dollar what is 3 quarters worth
okay ¢75 is how much out of 100 if it were pennies right okay which letter would you choose c now what i want you to do is what if we did not know anything about money
how would you change this to a decimal doing math divide what does the denominator represent when we divide the denominator is the divisor okay let us put it out to the side then and i want you to go ahead and divide
okay is group you may go to your seats seats hey guys
and and and 1st of all before even went over there i had to remind you more than once that you were too loud
this is why some of us may not be able to do group work very often because we can not control our actions
did you divide 30 divided by 4 is what have 75 hundredths number 4 madison took 30 pictures on her vacation
i am going to write down 30 pictures she put 20 of these pictures in her photo album now i am going to make something that looks like a photo album and write 20 in it
30 she put 20 of them in the album fraction 20 thirtieths take a 2nd look at it
what would that be
one guys what do both of these end with that what else ends in a 0 that is a friendly number 10 could that be a factor be 2 thirds what would that be
20 thirtieths simplified again they end in zeros 2 thirds because what is 20 divided by 10
2 what is 30 divided by 10 32 thirds yes like people we have got just 2 more problems over here and then we are going to come together as a whole group again and go over these problems
while you are waiting you can be looking at your other pages that we checked to see if you can correct those chair number 5
true 2 thirds is less than 6 fifths do we need to change them to common denominators
even though i am looking at 2 thirds and 6 fifths and which one would be the closest to one whole which one of those 2 fractions would be closest to one whole or more than one whole
is that more than one whole how many fifths does it take to make one whole
if you have a pie and it is divided into 5 pieces how many pieces does it take to make one whole draw a picture one 2 3 4 5 fifths right
whole this is 15th 5 how many do we have 6 do we have enough to make one whole okay so that would be one and how many fifths would we have leftover
15th leftover okay thirds is 15th less than 2 thirds yes it is true is 2 thirds less than 6 fifths yes
sure 8 tenths is less than 3 fourths no 620 firsts is greater than 10 twelfths again use common sense whole how many 20 firsts does it take to make one whole
21 and we only have 6 you know that is going to be less than 10 twelfths look at d 3 fourths is less than 2 thirds if we change those common denominators what would that common denominator be 4 and 3 what would be the common denominator
12 so we have 9 twelfths is equal to 3 fourths and 8 twelfths is equal to 2 thirds is 3 fourths less than 2 thirds no
ones last one number 6
12 can i use 12 as a common denominator then we would only have to change one of them 3 fourths is how many twelfths would that be 9 twelfths 4 times 3 is 12 3 times 3 is 9
3 fourths and 9 twelfths are they equal that one is true 7 eighteenths and 2 thirds denominator eighteenths are you on task
up 3 times 6 is 18 12 now you have got 7 eighteenths and 12 eighteenths you decide if that one is true or false go back to your seats and work on the next set of fractions
that was your choice and your consequence i am not going to argue with you
11 fifteenths number 2 is a very real life problem here you could be baking mixing up chocolate chip cookies and you already used the one half cup measuring cup all you have left to use is the 13rd cup measuring cup and 14th cup measuring cup
which one would you use if you need to measure out a half a cup of chocolate syrup use the 14th measuring cup
k 2 times 2 times or 2 fourths number 3 which of the following numbers is equivalent to 3 fourths that is a fraction and all of your answer choices were in decimals that is one of those where you have to change a fraction to a decimal by using what operation
table quietly line up so we can go to lunch i guess
yesterday we started making our 4 brothers book yesterday our mean median mode and range brothers book
today is coming around and she is passing out your books that you started yesterday remember what you need to do is you need to make sure that you have what needs to be on the front hand what do you have to have on the front one you have to have the title you have to have the title
what does the title have to include raise your hand if you know what the title has to include k the mean no the close not quite mean median mode and range exactly it has to contain those 4 words
have what is it your name not just your name but it must say what okay now what needs to be on the inside of each one
one the brothers okay it s got to have the picture of the brothers what else g the paragraph about the brothers whichever exactly you need to have the picture of the brother brother what needs to be done
what 5 problems 5 examples or problems period when you re finished with it you may just turn it into the math basket your crayons markers and scissors are at your desk can i recruit you to help out since she wasn t here yesterday does anybody have any questions about what you need to be doing
you actually what i want you to do is i want you to just color and read the story yes i m sorry friends these questions might be your questions so keep your mouth closed yes
didn t you say 2 or more persons no you must have 5 examples but in your examples you can have 2 to 10 numbers in your series 10 that s not an option go ahead and move with him
sir is it all right if i yep as long as i can see your series as long as i can see your answer it s fine with me
for mode you might just want to so you don t have to show any work as long as you have them in order you re fine when you do average you should i need to be able to see your work on average work i need to be able to see the steps
and
you re in big trouble no i m just kidding the 3 teachers just in case you know i might not be back but just in case the 3 teachers are volunteering their time not paid time to help certain students for crct if you re selected it s because you are not on the top you re not on the bottom
you re in the middle so we want to help you guys get from the 2s to the 3s is this is not for friends that we re worried about not passing this for friends we re worried about maybe trying to make it seem but not quite making it without extra help this is extra help basically what is says it s a letter to your parents it is after school it is only 5 days from 3 15 to 5 15
okay if someone else can pick you up that s fine as long as we have mom s approval it you re going to be in a small classroom not a lot of students and you ll have more time with the teachers the teachers are going to teach you 1st of all skills that and also testing skills
name the parent has to put down the number if you ve been selected it s because i know you won t be a discipline issue it s cause i know that you re going to want to work a really try if you can t do it you can t do it but i need you to return this either way if you can t do it have mom write a note saying thank you anyway i m sorry we can t
now this is not a tutoring group this is a group of people that i think can make 3s but might need a little extra help yes you need to stay after school and mom or whoever picks you up at 5 15
yes i can t do it paper any other questions you stay right after school back so please stop please stop
level i don t want to take it to silence
i like you guys talking that s find with me but if we can t keep it quiet we may have to would you put it on my desk
i ll talk to you in a 2nd about it
done you re just working on median and you have 20 minutes left okay guys count down you have about 20 minutes left completely finished the best it can be
yes all right and come meet me over here
this is a good thing not a bad thing the 35th grade teachers are giving their time they re not being paid
i can tell by your cover this is c work
are you a c student no
okay what now
okay this is not colored i ll take this but i m not going to promise you you don t have to start all over
it i ll take it but it s work
that please don t say i am cause that s going to make you move down good i m glad you re on i didn t move up
up if you ve liked to move up you have to show me focused work you may move a clip stacking the markers is something i continue to say is not okay and you re still doing it and just moved a clip a minute ago for doing the same thing
move a clip completely finished that s a work
you re fine okay friends stop look and listen i need all eyes on me watch i m up here i m ready for the ah s ah
okay done my hand is up your hand is up your seated i m sorry it really shouldn t take this long news this is your crct spring break packet
news the good news is you don t have to finish it just over spring break weeks friends my patience is wearing really thin
i understand you have 10 minutes left of school before spring break but i need you to focus right now great this contains every single subject including spelling there is reading and writing is included in language arts math you don t have to just do this over spring break you have until the friday before crct to turn them in due so you have 3 weeks from today before it is due
so yes it s a lot of work but it s also a lot of time grade it is a grade for every subject it you won t have time to work on it the other 2 weeks you will not have homework during crct boot camp homework so every night when you go home you work on this
if you spend 30 minutes a day between now and that friday that it s due working on this you ll get it done done how many questions are there it s not how many questions because it s different subjects do i have legitimate questions because if you talk and you have not raised your hand you re moving to clip n is one of those for each of us
d you re saying over spring break we don t have homework you don t have homework the entire crct boot camp b yeah most of it m is that one packet for one person yes this is one packet for one person g is that one packet that s it
l it doesn t make any sense because you said i m sorry i ve got friends being rude okay you said that we don t have homework but we do homework okay when i call your table up come up and get your packet
done we have the last 5 minutes of silent working
due okay next person that talks goes home on a one
okay we have been talking about fractions and earlier today we talked about how you simplify a fraction today what we re going to talk about this afternoon is how you can convert a fraction to a decimal so your essential question which you should have written down is how are fractions converted to decimals does everyone have it written down
yes make sure you have the date today october 10th method what s going to happen is you have your fraction the 3 fifths the 3 is going to be my cowboy hat he s got his little cowboy hat on
horse he s my denominator or numerator 5 denominator denominator is on the bottom top did you have a question it s okay to ask a question it s not going to work
guys all right so we have our cowboy here
yes so we re going to pretend our cowboy goes into the house and takes off his boots and hangs up his hat and eats 3 donuts
outside if i were to try to figure out the decimal for this i would draw my division bar which is going to be my house right sir it doesn t have we re going to use the one from the 1st page there at the very top we re doing your example on the notes page you should draw it just like i am
5 because he s my horse and he cannot come inside 3 because it s the numerator and he s the cowboy and he gets to go inside and eat his donuts
do 6 thank you for raising your hand 6 6 times 5 is 30 you should be writing that on the notes page to the right of your cowboy and horse
30 all the way down all right everyone have it written down it who can read the decimal for me that we got
j that s not how we say it tenths you don t have to say and 6 tenths because there s not a number in front right if it was like what is that me one and 6 tenths you read it like that when it has a decimal and a whole number in front
one and 6 tenths here we can just say 6 tenths does anyone know what percent i know we haven t talked about it yet but what percent would 6 tenths be j 6% not 6% 0 60% 60% it s 6 out of 10 which is equivalent to what out of 100
right so if there s 100 questions on my math interim like you had earlier there weren t 100 and i only got 60 right what s my percent week what if you got 10 right out of 100
right so on the bottom of your notes page you have a couple that you need to convert so it says 68s you need to convert that to a decimal now then i m going to have someone come up and do it on the board if you want to draw a horse for the 1st couple you may but don t spend the whole time drawing the horse
yes you re converting it to a decimal like we just did which one is going to be my horse no i set up the 1st one for you sir is that 60 that s fine
decimal then you bring down another 0 remember
more it will be another 6 then put a bar over it you okay yes ma am let s come up here and work it
one it s 6 eighths you reduced it division now divide 3 fourths put your 4 in the 3
fractions she did that 1st so if you do it that way what would i divide by what am i going to divide my top and bottom by if i want to reduce it 2 so i can reduce it 1st and hopefully you already know what decimal this is going to be if i have 3 fourths or 3 quarters what s my decimal going to be
know write it you re not doing your dividing if you have 3 quarters how much is a quarter be 2 is how many
25 +25 how much is a half dollar ¢50
s ¢70 70 what 75 75 i liked how she went ahead though and simplified it 1st because you may end up simplifying it to a fraction you know and you won t have to do the division
one you weren t here you were testing i ll pull you in a few minutes when they break apart and we ll do it you got pulled out of the room what did you get pulled out of the room for testing so that group that got pulled out of the room earlier you didn t hear the fractions for simplifying so i ll pull you when they break up and we ll do it
blue use black instead thanks black hold on 1st he knows that 12 cannot go into 9
he puts his decimal and then he must know his multiplication facts because he knows that 12 times 7 was going to be 84 really fast so seeing that it s 75 hundredths as our decimal what do you think an equivalent fraction would be to 9 twelfths if i simplify it what am i going to be
4 huh remember 75 hundredths is the same as 3 fourths it s the same as me having 3 quarters for ice cream and then them telling me that s not enough because you have to have a dollar
good who can do 2 thirds for me remember it s a repeating decimal so you have to have that little bar with the 2 numbers the one we talked about yesterday down just go in
after how many times can it go into 20
now you ve got to bring down another 0 right very good 3 into 20 again so we re going to get 18 again right
we can conclude that our number is going to keep going right yes so i want you to put a little bar above that last 6 decimal 66 hundredths is how we have it written but that number that bar remember that s how our decimal goes on and on and on stop so rather than have you keep doing that for an entire page we let you put the bar over it
okay that bar signals that decimal keeps going terminate so what is the fraction it s still 2 thirds you want to do 119 tenths if you were listening i gave you a hint on that one
9 tenths okay
correct how many times can 10 go into 90 me so you see this one was kind of easy
9 tenths you know how to write 9 tenths because we ve done decimals haven t we no 90% if there s 10 questions on a test and you get 9 of them right you want 9% or the 90% you get 90 because they re 10 points each
right we re going to go back to that on you can see that there s a relationship between our decimals and our fractions 4 tenths in fraction form is the same as that
sir 4 hundredths there would be a 0 in front of that 4 remember 35 hundredths okay put my decimal then i just have 3 in my tenths spot 5 in the hundredths right
yes then you write it out 35 hundredths if i want to write it in word form 57 hundredths write that n decimal form that 57 over 100 in your journal just flip it over on the back side
this side all right come and write it up here yes easy enough in the tenths spot thank you
in hundredths very good nice little review way i like that method but if you want to do it a different way there is creating an equivalent fraction again say it louder
right remember when we talked about decimals you just add a whole bunch of zeros on to the end and it can be equivalent it so this is kind of similar to that what i m going to do what did they do here
they re trying to change the denominator to a thank you they re trying to change the denominator to a 10th or 100th 5 we know if we multiply it by 2 it will be 10 right
no yes yes equivalent fraction with tenths or hundredths top multiply by 2 so i get 6 tenths so what s my decimal for 6 tenths that decimal then a 6 right
there i need to find a way to get to 10 or 100 bottom i get 25 hundredths and what is that in decimal form
that s not going to work okay if you can t easily change it to 10 or 100 hold on you need to use division did horse and cowboy 3 eighths 3 divided by 8 so your 3 goes inside and the 8 goes outside then you divide
here okay how many times can 8 go into 30 6 that s only 18 you can go a couple more than that
3 yes okay that s not right change it
28 it would be 8 times 3 there this is 27
now subtract that should have been your answer
get how many times 8 is my horse 30 what is 8 into 30
you what is 8 times 3 27 you were right 24 sorry you re right 8 then make it 6 right 8 can t go into 6 can it
now okay 56 now you have 4 5 how are you confused
it you got confused because they put that decimal there 1st i did it wrong what did you do
you i did all of the zeros behind you could have just rewritten the problem all those zeros threw you off right i got 3 up you don t put the 0 up there just because you can t divide into that number down there
number oops all right set you need to have your eyes up here on the screen paying attention
honey let s see do please don t yell out up it s kind of hard to see the colors
down wait is 4 fifths the same as 25 hundredths yes no
4 fifths is not the same as 25 hundredths so you flip that over because that s not right which color is this someone needs to come pick another one
again
over thank you that s not appropriate right now nope all right then doing the next we re getting there next
remembered then after that and 8 tenths we haven t seen that one same then yes
finds ooh one it s one of the ones flipped just written differently
guys 0 you 2 tenths nope
back that s 4 tenths is next 4 fifths okay it if we have to divide this out yeah way 4 fifths i m going to if i multiply the top by 2 and the bottom by 2 what am i going to get
8 tenths that is why that is the same as that all right is there anyone that has not come up here at all like has not worked any problems all right then then
attention no turn 0 yeah when you clicked it
2 fifths it was the one you picked that s not right it was one of the ones you picked i was speaking to her a good job
2 okay can you let it go yay all right so here s what you need to do
the group that was testing earlier doing interim testing when we did fraction simplification you re moving to that table right there talking everyone else there s 5 questions on this easel here
i would like you to complete those in your journal 1st then you re going to play a game and the way you play this game if you re waving your hand at me or moving right now you re not going to understand the game when you get to play it so what s going to happen is you are going to get in groups of 2 or 3 you need to pick smart choices for your partners do not pick people that you re best friends with or you know you re going to spend the entire time talking and goofing around with
all right you re each going to have a sheet and you get 2 dice set you need 2 per group okay you re going to roll it and record the 2 numbers you get in these little boxes here
horse cowboy so you re going to round it up above this fraction bar here horse he goes as my denominator okay on the bottom then i m going to divide because i want to get decimal form
so what goes outside the house the horse so i m going to put my larger number outside the house because he s the horse my smaller number inside the house because that s the cowboy then i m going to divide once you do your 5 questions that will be up here
actually you re just going to need one paper per group one those 5 questions need to get answered without talking right now then you can move into your groups
7 ninths 9 into 7 please i will be checking them when you go to science today we re not getting there yet
it my friends over here get out of my chair see we were talking about simplifying fractions while you guys were testing still long that s not math talk right now
if i have a fraction like 4 over 6 what i want to do is simplify it you to simplify it i need to find come sit by me me all right so we have a 4 and a 6
factors we have one 2 thank you 3 what s the largest one they have in common out of these 6 doesn t get a 4 so 2 right to simplify a fraction i m going to divide my numerator by 2 and my denominator by 2
so 4 divided by 2 is 2 3 so that is my simplified version of my fraction we re trying to simplify it though the goal is to make it smaller on this one they re going to be able to hear you
task can we talk about it in a minute when the other group leaves let s do one more you this is why you got pulled over here 10 we re going to do 5 tenths
to what are my factors 1st one 5 one and 5 right what about 10 common 5 right so i m going to take my 5 and divide it on the top and the bottom
there i put the dice up there this is all you re doing finding the greatest common factor and using that to divide if you are trying to simplify a fraction you do your greatest common factor 1st then you use that to divide your numerator and denominator by
one 10 divided by 2 half the answer here is 2 thirds 2 greatest common factors 1st
dice can you wait a few minutes that s a totally different topic 1st no one picked it up spilling it s okay
i am going to get since she is the one who gave me the thinking blocks i did i did some of you have done it and this is a way for you guys to get extra credit guys she gave me her thinking blocks did you get 100
yes so we are going to do this one it go to the computer may there you go
minute hold on
so the question is that you got to find it says purchased half meter of a ribbon and she has a 3rd of a meter in her robotics project what is the length of the remaining piece 1st thing it is telling you to do is find the least common denominator for half and a 3rd so she has got go ahead
do you want to talk to us tell me what you are doing whatever you did at home tell me what you are doing in here
it under it it you need to switch just give her a chance
go ahead go ahead is that correct no
yes they say amount remaining on top
on it is right there it is under the is the red part the amount remaining
3rd right here is that correct yes no switch where shhh
k you supposed to switch which are 0 switch right there 13rd and the question mark remaining is that the question or is that the amount used said what is that you are trying to find out the amount used
used yes you are trying to find do you understand yes go ahead is that correct yes check yes
is yes
c i mean you do not have any answers in there yes it is not 9
it is one ninth i mean 16th she says 16th i thought it said 2 sixths well look at the drawing see you see one shaded in green you do not know what the answer is so you put 16th green is 16th explain that again
it says you do not know what it is so if it is and only this one is shaded green 16th does it make sense yeah how many of you did not get that
easier and again if you want to go to thinking blocks you can get that certificate i think it is 5 problems you get 5 problems as you get them all right then that means that you understand do here is the next thing that let me have that for a minute and this is what we are going to be working on
remember yes so let us work on this today question you should have it on your math journals
essential question how we subtracting mixed numbers how do we subtract mixed numbers and this is going to be by converting them into improper fractions yes at 1st least common denominator yes we can do that too
12 well the denominator is 12 numerator how do they go from 4 to 12 they found common denominator they already did which is 12 12 multiply by
why because you are multiplying 3 times 2 4 you subtract you keep the 4 yes yes so your fraction your mixed number should be what down yes what should be the next one you got 12 how do you go from 6 to 12
2 huh 2 fraction i mean 2 twelfths 2 so let us check what do we simplify to
yes well 2 and 4 twelfths then you go to 2 and 2 sixths and then you go to 2 and 13rd yes
so it is most or you can divide by 4 4 divided by 4 equals one
3 go ahead do it on the board go ahead go ahead we got 2 people right there the rest of you work it in your math journals
that some of you are doing the drawing pretty good you hmmm i do not think it is easier for me to draw it it you got 3 wholes and 4 tenths right
fifths you draw one whole you draw one whole in a circle you color it in they have 0 i see a problem in here if you have 4 can you spend 6
do you have to break one of those into you got to do that understand if you got 4 you can not spend 6 you can not go to wal mart and say i got $4 can you give me $6 worth of groceries right
right number 2 where is my equal sign this why are we putting it subtraction should be over there here no the equal sign goes in the line between the 2 numbers here you subtract what happens to the whole number
it i do not see you doing anything i got it no it is one that is a one right there 2 and 15th no
that 0 yes what is 3 and 4 tenths we have to rename 3 and 4 tenths what do we rename 3 and 4 tenths to what 2 and go show them have a seat for a minute so i got it right right have a seat for a minute
no just work on have a seat for a minute please show me how you rename 3 and 4 tenths cross out these and put a one right here what do we rename 3 to
2132 actually we just renamed 3 to 20 it is one +2 2 and then what do you have
then you add the one to the 14 wait is it what you did
is we do not need that right now now yes
there see the problem that i have is that you guys do not put the equal sign you got 3 and 4 tenths and all of a sudden you end up with no equals signs then you go from 3 and 4 tenths equals 4 tenths that is not true
he says one and 8 tenths
ahead so he has got one and 4 fifths would you change your color please me do no
out you got that
thing if the question in the crct is going to tell you that you have to do it in simplest form then it will have to be you got to simplify it you yes huh can you say what you just said if the question asked you to simplify it or give the answer into the simplest forms is one and 4 fifths the same thing as one and 8 tenths
yes one and 4 fifths is it blocks here is what we are going to do it some of you might have and probably will be wise if you need more than one then you can just share with the other person
so get all the cubes out the 1st step the 1st one we are going to do is 2 and 3 eighths i only got 12
i need fractions yeah get these ones out just do not confuse them you might have to work with somebody so it goes we got to do 2 whoops then share with her
he only had these then work with somebody else who no you can use those yes you can use those
give me 5 please guys just take you can have these one
do 1st thing that you are going to show me is 2 and 3 eighths now if you have this kind as the same thing you can do 2 by having 2 halves same if you do not have this kind but you have this kind you still can have 2
2 so you are going to do listen listen you are going to do show me or have 2 and 3 eighths do it
2 and 3 eighths that is not 2 and 3 eighths this is 23 eighths that is it it show me 2 and 3 eighths he has got it
it i got it can i get 5 please have a seat please have a seat
away so i still see some of you who do not have 2 and 3 eighths if you have this kind if you want to put it like you have it that will be fine
now you are going to add or you are going to show me one and one fourths one and 14th or one and a quarter shhh now no that is not right add it up
if you add those 2 what do you get one and one half you have 2 and 3 eighths and you are going to add one and 14th what do you get shhh show me
get i want to say this one more time 5 you have enough to do it individually here is 2
and some of you already have 2 and 3 eighths now the question is what is 2 and 3 eighths +one and 14th show me me no no no that what is it it is really it is half of it is 2.5 it is 3 and 5 eighths she says 5 eighths you said 2.5
3 and added it me this is a whole what is it 3 and one half anybody have 3 and one half
half because you mean for that answer yes why because she said one half so i have these and that is already one so over here you have 2 and 3 eighths this is 2 and 3 eighths and then you are adding one and one fourths so what do you do one huh how
half how do you get 3 and one half because we turned this 4 into an 8 and then why do not you do it it i turned both of the he means on paper no here and then you take those and put into a half hmmm like that so what is it
one half 3 and one half let us see if you got it right no no you can not you can not nope that is not right yes not 2 but you said no i said 2 and 3 eighths and one and one fourths 0
me help him out out yeah is this one and 3 eighths hold on
lost show me 2 and 3 eighths hold on it move to the side so they can do it
because we added 2 and 3 eighths +one and 14th yeah but you got 2 different denominators yes 0 because we 14th and 2 we turned the denominator of 4 into 8
because at 1st at 1st i did not get she has got 3 and 4 eighths i got 3 and 4 why how do you get 3 and 4 eighths let us do the next one
answer we add them you got to add them we are finished what is it
0 you need to add it all together 12 where is 3 and one eighths where is 3 and one eighths well you can make the whole
one that is 2 so one and 3 fourths that is 3 and one eighths there is 3 and one eighths now you got to add one and 3 fourths now you can borrow somebody is here so you can do 14141414
that is teacher hold on a minute that is 14 fourths so 3 fourths will be this
do we talked about hold on a minute one eighths one eighths one eighths i need 3 fourths i was here 1st me too 0 my gosh i was here 1st now you got one and 3 fourths now add them up
seat what do you have 4 and 7 eighths how
me because come up here and show it
say 2 eighths equals 14th 2 eighths equals 14th so it is 1318th 3 eighths 5 eighths 7 eighths so basically what you are telling me is that 2 halves make a whole
yes and then 31 thirds make a whole 3 yes and 234516th make a whole this i was missing one of my 6th so how do you come up with your answer teacher yes
41 halves and that equals 2 eighths and like said 2 and one eighths equals 4 fourths so i did 2 times yeah 2 times 3 equals 6 got 4 and 7 eighths how do are you still not sure what you are doing
it i did 3 and 18th and then i did one and 3 fourths which is one and 3 fourths and then i made the 4 into an 8 because 4 times 2 is 8
opposite so let us do 3.5 show me 3.53.5 got it
it and we are going to subtract one and 14th one and 14th
show me 3.53.5 why are you moving this
2 now you need a 3 where is the 3 now you got 3 now make it half add 2 and 2 sixths i got it teacher stay where you are
it what do you get get we got 2 and 2 sixths go to the board and do that one for me
2nd 3.5 -one and 14th you said what teacher one and 14th one and 14th it is right there yes
teacher hold on a minute 0 okay i thought i know
see i am just making sure we got the same thing i got sorry have a seat have a seat seat how we doing
get we have do you want to explain how you did it it here is somebody who has got this kind cause you can do it with this too go ahead quickly cause we got to go
there is 3.5 and one and 14th there is still 14th so how do you do it
how you do that no you do not need that i just want i want you to tell me the way you did it right there 1st one we got are you ready ahead hold on a minute and have a seat have a seat
ladies go ahead what we did is that we used hold on cause we can not hear you what we did is that one half and 14th so least common denominator is 4
so we changed that into a 4 you have to you keep the one and 14th and you change the 4 pay attention please the 4 and 24s and you subtract it
and hard no you are doing fine and take away 14th and 3 -one equals 2
i want to let you have those blocks that you have cause now we got a bunch of word problems it is about 10 word problems now you can use your blocks to answer the questions they say that you got to write a number sentence to show how many pints of their special color they had
around i do not want to hear all this talking cause we are doing this individually
i am going to ask you to come to the board and do the 1st one
here i am going to help you with the 1st problem
eh and were painting a mural at school they need to make a special color so they mixed 4.5 pints of blue paint 2.5 pints of white paint and 2 thirds of a pint of green paint
write a number sentence to show how many pints of their special color they had
you were supposed to do 4 and one half then add the other one yeah of course you got to solve it
doing so that is 4 half let us borrow this half
10 i am sorry that is 4.5 then you got to add she said i need that 2 and 16th add 2 and 16th why the only thing you are doing is putting them all together
that is 16th 16th 2 sixths no you got to do 2 wholes and 16th 2 wholes that is only 16th so how do you you tell me
whole you got to do a sentence not i do not know what you write no like this 0 a number sentence not right
course my suggestion is do it on a separate sheet of paper or do it in your math journal guys the problem should be done in your math journal i am doing that here is what the problem says it says write a number sentence to show how many pints of their special color they had
she already did the sentence for you which is 4.5 +2 and 16th +2 thirds answer but the problem is going to be done in your math journal so you actually know what is it that you are doing
correct number one problem is correct why do not you explain how do you go from 6 eighths 8 sixths to 7 and 13rd 6 and 8 sixths yes how do you get that well since 6 and 86th is an improper fraction so 8 hold on
way 8 sixths as a mixed number is what half 86th as a mixed number is what yes it is one and 26th so that is the one that she is adding to the 6 and getting 7 that if you did not do it or if you do not still did not get write it down
10 there is my journal you hid my journal let me get you up here
here number 2 problem so what is the answer to number one are you done ran 56th of a mile
problem i am asking you to use those cubes so you can actually show the problem out ran 56th of a mile mile who ran farther write a number sentence to show the difference between the 2 distances
do shhh shhh what are you supposed to do question write the number sentence to show the difference between the 2 distances
6s show me 5 sixths 12345 and 3 fourths
where is 4s 123 here is 16th i mean 5 sixths and 3 fourths now basically i gave you the answer
not well looking at this you already know which one is bigger right yeah how do we make it the same it least common denominator what is the least common denominator or what is the common denominator huh
it so basically you are excuse me you are doing an equivalent fraction for 5 sixths and 3 fourths what is it what is an equivalent fraction for 5 sixths since you already said the common denominator is 1210 twelfths shhh shhh i do not know
me go to the board and do it
and you compare them and 6 twelfths yes
fourths what is the no the number on top is 3 what number is that why 9 huh yes
9 i can not hear you so you got 10 twelfths and 9 is that 9 twelfths so which one is bigger
no why not because you are not supposed to subtract you are supposed to compare he is not subtracting comparing he has got 9 twelfths and but see the question is who ran farther who ran farther who ran farther
ran farther so wait
do not erase it yet because wait let us wait
you now the next question is write a number sentence to show the difference between the 2 distances so you can explain that now
well ran 5 sixths no i mean you are fine
i mean you just did 5 sixths -3 fourths you got an equivalent fraction which is what got 10 twelfths and 3 fourths is 9 twelfths the difference between the 2 is going to be 112th so the question is ran 3 fourths of a mile who ran farther or and what is the difference between the 2 distances
you re good to go you re all set to go and this as well everything s fine thank you all right let s see material this is here okay remember the rules everyone
you raise your hand if you have a question name you raise your hand if you have a question started okay please sit where excuse me
pencil 0 i don t no you don t okay so let s start thank you teacher everyone who remembered what we did yesterday who can tell me
we had maybe 3 students absent yesterday so who can tell me what did we do in math yesterday okay loud and clear because everyone remember we are being videotaped so you need when you give me your explanation please put that backpack away your explanation should be clear okay
ahead tell me what we did it s right there what we did yesterday go ahead we made boxes to yeah boxes of 3 6 by 4 by 0 you started to say something very important you made 3 3 dimensional boxes and the dimensions were
3 and then we filled them with cubes we filled them with cubes or packages of okay different packages okay so today you are and when we did that everyone when you made the boxes you made the patterns correct
you made the boxes and you filled them with different packages what were you finding what were you finding when you did that finding how many packages could fit inside the okay so when you were finding the number of packages that fit inside the cube were you looking for the area perimeter or the volume
volume okay so you were finding the number of packages that fits in the in the box me okay we know what perimeter is correct
a width times the okay just said perimeter is width times what length height width times length times height do you agree that perimeter is width times length times height perimeter 0 no
okay so what is perimeter please do not raise your hand if you have an answer and i will call you so what is perimeter the perimeter is . what is perimeter yes
length plus width okay so she said length plus width times 2 no or is this a formula to find perimeter formula okay so that s a formula to find perimeter so what is perimeter
okay said perimeter is a distance around a shape here okay let s say this is my garden and i m walking the perimeter of my garden i m walking the distance around my garden
so if i want to find the distance then i need to multiply the i need to multiply length plus width times 2 out so now area everyone who can describe area for me j it s the inside of the shape okay the area is the inside of a shape
can we clarify that a little bit more everyone the inside of a shape m an area is it s the . yes go i forgot you forgot
j it s the 2 dimensions multiplied okay so this is what just said multiplied so that is what are the 2 dimensions the 2 dimensions 6 and 4
called they re called length and width okay so the 2 dimensions so you the area is the 2 multiplying the length by the width but is that a definition again or is that a formula formula that s a formula
m area s like the number cubic feet yards or inches inside a shape okay so the number of cubic cubic feet well we don t have feet yet so the number of cubic units that will cover a space
t 0 well the dimensions are length and the width but said the number of cubic units i meant to say square okay said the number of square units that will cover a space
so now if this is my floor and i want to put tiles on it i need to find out the number of square units before i buy my tiles so now we want to find the volume so what is volume okay someone else i see all what is volume volume is the length width and height okay so what about the length width and height what about it
you measure the how long the length and width are and you measure how high okay so what do we do with these measurements then you add them together okay so we add the length plus the width plus the height yeah no do you agree with do now remember we re describing volume
said we find the length them is that volume do you agree with
do you agree with length plus width plus height what about you not cause you have to do the length plus the width plus the height
you have to add the length plus the width plus the height to find volume no think volume is this correct length plus width plus height to find volume a length times width times height okay so now said it s the length times the width times the height
no it s the formula okay that is again the formula to find volume so now volume width length and height so how do we describe volume the volume volume is the height of a shape okay any other definition for volumes
was if we have the box yesterday we had the box e we put different packages in them we were finding we put different packages in them so how would you describe volume i would say it s the answer of length times width times height that is true
that s how you find volume but how do we describe volume yes cubic units that that s in the i mean that s in the box okay so now just says the number of cubic units everyone that s in the box so volume is the number of cubic units the capacity that can fill a container okay
right so now having said that so yesterday you had to fill packages in a box and you were given the dimensions
now today you re going to work with your partner and you will have 25 minutes to work with your partner so this time you re not given the you re not given the dimensions okay dimensions you have different boxes different sizes and you have to fill your box completely with each package
so you have with your partner you have to decide the size of your box so why don t we all turn to our activity book to page 27
directions please start reading the directions for me 27 yep okay why don t you just put that away somewhere so you can have enough space together page 27
start reading the directions loud and clear
direction so everyone should underline the directions design single open box okay
and lastly d completely fill your box now be prepared to convince the class that your solution is correct a okay we know what the i m not going to tell you the dimensions know you know the dimensions of box a box b i m sorry not box
package package a package b package c and package d when you have made a box and tested that it works record its dimensions okay so once you ve made your box and you ve tested that it works record the dimensions all right
and that s it okay let s think about working together because the past couple of days you ve been working together and i think we need we should spend some time on how to work together because 3 groups yesterday didn t complete the assignments because some people were talking and were not on task
why don t you sit next to and join okay all right so some ideas everyone on how you should work together class for you to be successful what do you need to do to
okay you should follow the directions what about you me talk about the okay i think that before yesterday you were you didn t take a few minutes to really understand the direction and process the direction before you start the project okay
you just you started noticed that some people right away started to draw the pattern without even thinking about the different packages that you had to put in the box what the without even thinking about that or even planning yes not fight about who does what okay just said not fight about who does what
the goal is for you to be successful for you to put together a pattern make a box and find and finish the assignment so is there any question about what you have to do
no so now i am going to give you your interlocking cube so that you can fill make your packages 3 come here
please each pair should have 3 rods i hope we have enough everyone you need one more
i think we re in trouble everyone okay try to make the packages if you need more okay you have your paper for your box
you have to design a box moment we need more okay you have to figure that out with your partner closed don t you need to look at the packages to figure out what the size of your box
we already have c down okay good else i already have b
b okay maybe you can what are you doing together maybe you can help her make the packages so you can think about the size of your box
i need more cubes you need okay so you have one a we need more let s see this is already this is okay
we need more i hope we don t run out of cubes everyone i thought i had enough 0 that s what i thought okay you 3 are working together right right okay who needs more cubes
i need one cube i need one cube that s not necessary
whoever s bang can i have more doesn t matter does it matter okay so you have all 3 packages so now okay so make a d e no this is another activity
this is what you re working on everyone this is another activity d so remember everyone you re working with packages a b c and d
4 thank you okay let s start the pattern before you start everyone you should plan 1st before you start drawing you should plan 1st decided have you looked at all the shapes to figure out what the height is going to be
sorry okay now you don t crush your book part so now let s think about how you re going which box what dimensions your box will be
before you even draw it on your paper you should think about everyone stop look listen everyone i think you should take a few minutes to really looking at each packages before you even draw on your before you even draw your pattern look at them and think about the length of your package the width of your package and the height of your package
okay and once you decide that then you can start drawing your pattern okay 0 wait a minute though but what does what read the direction
you are feeling you have to make a box big enough to fill package a by itself completely without space not all of them together okay each package you have to be able to fill each package d i saw okay so let s think about it though i thought of it dimensions okay let s think about the dimensions
be i don t know okay you need to 0 you did what is it that you did okay so what are the dimensions of your box 6 by 4 by 3 3 so what happens when you fill your box with this package
remember you can only fill your box with one package so what happens when you fill your it won t fit huh it won t fit fit it s too big no it s not the box will be too big remember you have to completely fill the box
okay no do not touch the scissors i need to see your pattern right here we need to have a conversation before you start cutting m i m thinking no sweetie what were my directions no okay let s make the boxes
packages i keep on where are your packages this is a c please do not get out of your seat without permission c and okay this is c and where is d okay and this is d
okay so let s think about okay so what do you think boxes i think since we count them but we added them all together but remember according to the directions when you make your box when you make your box you should be able to fill your box with this package completely without any space
and you should be able to fit your box completely with this package without any space and so on and this package as well so what could be look at you have 5 of them different okay let s concentrate on these these 4 okay
so you have 4 packages here right hint hint think about what they have in common okay you what s going on here packages okay did i ask you to put them together
are you following directions huh is that what you re supposed to do right now put them all together do i m supposed to try to figure out find what find you are supposed to build a box that will fill each package completely not put them together because right now you are wasting time okay let s get going here everyone there is one missing have it should be just by 2
okay when i look at your pattern something doesn t make sense look does this make sense to you no it doesn t go no she did it wrong okay she did it okay so what s okay start over again
now you should be concentrating on you should be it s impossible you should be concentrating on right now making your pattern and making your boxes okay 3 i tried and what else have okay let s and with that c
c work together with your partner
yes there are quite a few possibilities okay think about a box that you can make that will feel this package that will take this that you can fill with this package completely with this package completely each package completely as it is directed okay
so what do you have see okay let me see
2 so let me see your pattern yes you have more than enough space if it s remember the height is 2 okay conversation you re playing with this and she s drawing i need to see you 2 talking together and i don t see what are the dimensions
we figured out a box that could fit a b c and d no because that s what it says here box could completely that d would completely okay if you had your boxes packages let me see your packages put them together
we got it have where s your box where s the height the height okay so how are you going to how are you going to build this box with this okay all right so we need to think about it some more cause that s what they that s what yes please stop
yes so what are the dimensions see okay that looks good all right so why do you think let me see the dimensions paper you know what
productive i just got you need to wait though i was waiting this whole time all right you need to wait behavior that s destructive what s destructive this is a classroom okay here let s see what you have here 1st so you have i have a problem with your pattern let me see this please
so here i m thinking this would work this side would work but when you put this side together that s not going to work 0 no because yeah exactly because it s not even all right let s see raise this now let s think about okay good down okay this is no let s write the dimensions right here
3 by 2 by 3 by 2 by 9 6 no our height is 2 2 so i don t understand this notation
2 no length yeah i need one more teacher can we use one more hold on hard we tried no where are you no come on now you re not being productive my friend my little mathematician you re not being productive box okay so let s 3 by 6 by 2
6 that s the width the length is 6 2 okay so do you think this will work will you be able to fit how would you fit this package in your box no it s not 0 wait a minute that s your height this is your height so how would you fill this package in your box
right there i put it okay will you be able to fill this yes you have completely no sweetie one package at a time one package at a time will you be able to fill it completely with this package no back okay so you need to change your dimensions see stop for a moment
me everyone is looking at me cause right now some people are not being productive i m walking around and i see some people are working really hard and others are just talking
around push your chair in please and you are working with student d who s really was really working hard trying to figure out how to plan make this pattern and you should be having a conversation about your length your width and your height and how you re going to make the box not turned around and talking to
productive we have our dimensions okay so what are the dimensions miss just quickly look at okay so 2 so this is let s see all right so 12 work that would work
so we then you have to think about why it would work okay i know why all right so why because don t add them all up cause look this goes in one 6 so you can fill packages in your box one so how many of these packages will you fit in your box 6 why is it 6
one 2 3 wait a minute remember that that s right 0 yeah okay good job okay so we have one 2 packages completed already let s see everyone listen be patient okay i got it
a you have b c and d okay now i m looking at d and i m looking at a think what s different about these 2 shapes d is higher by one level okay so what would happen if i turned d this way
height yes okay so why don t we think about that a little further and see about building your box okay here so what s going on with the 3 you can get tape okay so what s going on here what have you done so far erased it
else tried to figure out which okay so we need to i need to see you having a conversation you re not having a conversation you re sitting there d okay let s think about these 3 packages what they have in common
yesterday i know you weren t here yesterday but you were here yesterday so you should be the voice here box we made a box but we have to figure out what would go inside it the only difference with yesterday s activity and today s activity is that with today you don t have the dimension and you also have to completely fill the box okay
stop why are you out of your seat can you please not do that sit down please sit down okay this is yours sit down okay and who else needs tape
no do you have a pattern no she can do that on her own right now you need to plan your box cause your assignment isn t complete we figured it out it s 2 by 3 by 6 but we can t draw it on this okay so 2 by 3 3 but again you won t be able to fill this box this package in your box completely if the height is 3 2 so then you have a problem here this one has a height of 3
okay so let s think about this okay is there another way you can put this package in your box besides vertically no happens it becomes 2 by 3 by 2
more yes let s see what you have okay that could work all right some scissors okay let s turn around
here i okay we shouldn t be playing moment okay remember what we did yesterday yeah okay is this how we fold up the boxes yesterday 0 yeah i forgot 0 yeah i forgot
okay so so let s complete this and write your dimensions so that you can share with the class okay let s see what you have done 0 wait now you re acting like kindergarteners instead of 5th graders not acceptable box okay so okay so did you okay that s right the dimensions
now you re going to share your findings with the class and think about how you re going to explain to the class why this work for all packages why you re able to fill your box with each package completely i thought it out okay think about it it all right and write your ideas no write your good prior knowledge so write your thoughts on your paper
okay hold on for 12nd it where are your packages turn around my pencil s broken all right get another pencil okay so why don t i see it written down 6 by 4 by 2 okay
work because the bottom i forgot what it s called the bottom part is the bottom is called what the the base the base okay the base yeah the base right here okay so it s is 6 60 you mean the area is 6
yeah since this is 2 by 3 so the area is 6 6 yeah and then the face right here on the side is 4 and the height is 2 4 right here so you re saying your dimension as 6
okay 6 by 4 and the height is 2 because the base is 6 6 okay the height is 2 so now will you be able to let me see the packages that you have packages you guys need to stop putting picking your packages apart
t you were putting it in the box yeah so you re able to fit okay if that s the case then what about this package will you be able to fill your box completely no work 7 by 7 okay let s think about it some more here so where i m really being surprised so what s the confusion
what s the confusion i m trying to figure out but then she keeps taking it away from me
am she says i know i know but she never does i did one right here yeah but okay so what but remember like said you have to look at each packages individually and think about if i build a box remember did i walk around here and tell you guys something about the height what did i say
that it s better if you put that over okay if you fill in the box horizontally instead of vertically right so now i thought that would solve your problem that 0 if i can do that then i can solve the height problem because before the height was the problem problem so now i need to figure out what my width and my length is going to be
okay so we need to wrap up everyone in a few minutes and 2 people will share 2 groups will share that s what s going on over there okay what s going on okay cause right now dropped this off you made a big claim on your writing paper now
so you need to prove to me all right so now what s going on now you re not being productive cause i don t see dimension hand so i m thinking everything is covered so i come here you didn t raise your hand
here so let s think about it today okay these are the packages good no okay so you have your 4 packages so now you have to build a box so that you can fill each package completely in your box
share we ll talk later okay okay so what do you have apart would you like to explain to the class why this fit yeah so how many of this package it would fit in your box
down okay people who are finished we will share in a few minutes listen you will share with the class the number of package you will need to i need you to stop playing and i need you to listen to directions okay
a couple of groups will be sharing with the class in a few minutes
please where somewhere on your paper class all packages how many of each package will fit in your box
why is this because 0 you re saying 2 by so you put them together 2 by 2 by 2 by what
why cause no that s correct so let s build the box good it okay now come on
it you can let s go dimensions this is where you write the dimensions okay over here what s going on here
work okay so it is what are the dimensions 3 no it s width width what is the length wait a minute what s the length the length is 3 2 would that would work 6
completely 0 look it fits completely okay so this here work all right so would this work part in this one and this right here this would work as well yeah okay but you still have the same problem though what about this space though how are you going to fill this space
it okay then you have to change your dimensions then this is what you have here let me see can i go to the bathroom go ahead go a look at your pattern i think i okay so to me i m looking at this length 3 i m not sure what this length is
2 okay why don t we stop for a moment
share okay i need everyone to pay attention okay right now i said we need to everyone listen
please remember if you re sharing let s be serious okay so now i d like 3 people to share 3 groups and and and and
class turn around face your audience them you re not cutting patterns right now away this is time to listen put the scissors away away please follow directions
we re listening and we are questioning and we re understanding okay
a 6 by 4 by 2 because since when the other one had 3 the height was 3
now so the dimension they build a box that is 6 by 3 by 2 right because this a didn t fit in it when it was the height was 3 it didn t fit in perfect so i lowered one down because they all have a side that has 2 and lower
ahead they can all fit cause they all have a side that s 2 and lower okay so how many of package a can you fit in your box no okay so i m not sure if the entire class is understanding what s going on with your work up move further back so everyone can see you
ahead so how many of package a can you completely fill in your box 6 package of a 6 okay for c there could be 12 packages for b 16 packages and d 4 packages okay for how many packages for b b this b okay for b 16 packages how many were you able to fit the 1st layer
we were able to fit how many packages were you able to fit see 2 4 6 8 correct 8 so 16 all right and a fit so it s one 2 3 4 5 6 this one was it s 12
6 so then all i had to do was double because okay so is saying for his box for package for package c he knew that the bottom layer the 1st layer he could cover the 1st layer with 2 4 6 packages
so all he had to do is multiply that by 2 and that s 12 packages for c 2 okay so let s go to and
where d that come from which one we did a 2 by 2 by 6 package 2 by 2 by 6
2 is it 2 by 2 by 6 everyone yes no no it s 6 by 2 by 2 okay 6 by 2 by 2 dimension s wrong no that s okay no she didn t the numbers were mixed together but she got the dimensions in wrong okay well she yes well when she wrote down the dimensions somewhat but this is good
on where s the we don t the package is here so how many of package a are you able to fit attention so package a they can fit 3 packages 3 of these packages in the box completely what about package d
2 2 okay and package what is that one 6 6 good and 3 attention we need to pay attention and look at the boxes
so we have 2 completely different boxes 2 completely different boxes everyone and they re able both groups were able to fit all these boxes completely with each of these packages more is yours the same as s the dimensions
e okay further what are the dimensions of your package width the length is 5 by 4 by 2
told you did 5 by 4 by 2 with i told you 5 by 4 by 2 everyone let s think about 5 by 4 by 2 no okay everyone let s think about 5 by 4 by 2
box again everyone if we re having a discussion you are playing with the cubes you are playing with the tape you are not listening if you re not listening you re not hearing you re not learning attention okay now s box is 5 by 4 by 2
that okay let me make this clear now can we fit the box with all this package completely now said right away said no j because are we listening
not maybe cause d wouldn t fit because it would have to have 3 somehow so what about if he put 3 3 and over here fit no cause here s 4 3 okay now there is a reason for that everyone what is it
what okay then again if you do that then you have a problem you won t be able to close the box so you won t be able to close the box listen we re going to close with this
boxes where is your box my box is right there it s right there okay we have these 3 boxes with 3 different dimensions we say that these 2 boxes would work and this one won t work
i have a name all right so some thought m turn your body around whatever you re playing with give that to me you know i don t understand why i have some students who really can follow directions and others are not able to follow directions so what s your thought what s your thought because all the but just think about these
all the packages that fit all the boxes had to have 6 as one of the dimensions okay is that what you were thinking okay so he said that all the packages that all the boxes that work one of the dimensions have had to be 6 yeah okay so could you have any other dimensions
okay so tomorrow we re going to start by thinking about that by thinking about why if i m looking at the base here the base of each box the 1st level of each box what is the area of the 1st level
fit how many cubic unit can you fit in the 1st level for this box 6 by one the 1st level how many cubic 24 here how many cubic units can you fit the 1st level 6 by 2 12 so let s think about the numbers 24 and 12
and tomorrow and then when we look at the base of these packages what is the connection so that s the question what is a connection so when we start tomorrow we re going to try to answer that question all right so now what i want you to do is get your math journal and answer these 3 questions quickly
yes that 2nd number next to the plus sign is that a one there isn t a percent there no i asked if that was a one which percent though you said percent no i asked if the number next to the plus sign this yeah that s a 7 okay
today in math we are going to continue to explore the strategies for multiplication and this is our objective for today
accomplish we are going to investigate the fact on the product when a factor is doubled or halved there are a lot of strategies for multiplying that involve breaking apart numbers so to start off our discussion today we are going to go back to page 53 that we did the other day
6 and of the problem problem one c was this problem 16 by 3 and 16 by 6 problem if you have your worksheet and you did it you might refer to the work you did on that sheet otherwise i want us to discuss how these 2 problems are related
related how are their products related it otherwise you need to figure it out quickly and then turn and talk to somebody sit up turn and talk to somebody i will give a few minutes to look at it
few minutes to look at that problem are you doing what i asked you to do have you solved the problem or you have your worksheet where you did it before in class
do you have your worksheet page 53 that we did on monday that is where the 2 problems came from
how are they related and does anybody see a relationship without solving it 1st it says that it is 3 6 as in like a time table that is what it says 3 6 6 where does it say 3 6
where is the 3 6 c what number is that 6 so can you repeat what you were saying again related yes
the 3 is a multiple of 6 6 can i count by 0 i mean 3 +3 gets you 6 so the answer plus the answer again will give the next one down there the answer of what teacher hold on let him finish the answer of 16 times 3 and plus another 16 times 3 will give you the answer down here did anybody hear what he said
yes i think he said that if you get the answer of 16 times 3 and you double the answer of 16 times 3 you get the answer of 16 times 3
z cause if you are doing an answer it will get you put into a sometimes if you double the bigger number it is going to stay the same i want those to use specific example that we are talking now before we make it interested in what is going to be true for all numbers or some class of numbers at least i need to see more hands up
up these are not the only people have been in this class since we have been looking at this kind of problem and you are not going to spend the whole period excuse me me move to the back table there thank you all the way to the back table there yes
he said that if you doubled the answer of 16 by 3 it would give us the answer of 16 by 6 can we explain that using either a story context or drawing or an array any way
c you can draw the picture you can put 3 boxes boxes if i do 3 boxes and do what and put 16 in the box box i will do that so you say i should draw 3 boxes
box yes yes yes boxes so this one represent this so this is 16 times 3 16 plus another 16 times 3
3 so that is 16 times 3 and that will give us what and then i could draw a box over on this side i could put 3 +3 equals 6 so you can do this yes so that would be 6
and this one would be your 16 by 6 this now what is the actual answer for 16 times 3 48 and 48 so is saying that 48 +48 will give us 96
and that will be the same thing as 16 times 6 is 96 up you can instead drawing you can just draw 6 boxes we can draw 6 boxes showing the 3 and the 3
so if you combine all of the boxes together one 2 3 4 5 so that is 16 16 16 16 16 16 and then you could just cut the middle off the one and they say like i cut the middle of this one and that would give me my 3 group of 16 and 3 group of 16 excellent now can we also use arrays to show that beside pictures
yes yes you can draw 16 going across and can you come and draw it picture and some of you should be thinking about this story that can help us to see that when we 11 of the factors and leave the other factor the same we are just doubling the product
that when we 11 of the factor and the other factor the same remains the same we are doubling the product of the problem so which one so has done an array here rectangles so this one would be the 3 by 16 and this one is the 3 by 16
6 so knows how to go from to show that there are 2 3 by 16 inside 6 by 16 everybody yes now if we compare this to the story of miss s and the apples what would that look like apple go in there i forewarned you
sit down you need to part of this discussion or i will send you into that room too no you cannot be a part of the discussion and you are throwing your head back on your chair
apples what is happening to explain what is happening to this problem to show that the size of the product will double if we 11 of the factor story yeah a story content that will help us to make sense has used array to show like i combine 2 small arrays to make the big one and used talked about using pictures
show them you how you can put 3 boxes of 16 and 3 boxes 16 to give you 6 boxes of 16 story what kind of story can help us to make more sense cause i am probably sure there is some people that are still confused why it is true yes are you ready or you want to go ahead
here there are 6 shelves there are 6 shelves and 16 apples apples on this shelf shelf so how many apples are there all together 96
96 so how does that transcribe to the 6 and 3 apples i mean 3 and 16 it if i half it said if i half what am i going to half here the 6 or the 16 6 when i half my 6 what will i get 3 so can you turn that into a story too so we can understand it
c there are 16 shelves 3 apples on you are turning it around she said 6 shelves 16 apples on each that let us leave the shelves as 6 apples 16 apples so how can we relate that to this problem 16 and 3 which one will be the shelves here and which one will be the apples
m the shelves can be 16 times 3 alike if i now have 16 shelves will it be the same presentation shelf does it look like this the picture is not going to come out right yes 3 shelves 3 shelves and 16 apples and 16 apples so what are you saying like said
we started with 16 3 groups of 16 and we doubled it to give us 6 group of 16 what because we only have 16 by 3 here our answer was 48 now if i have 16 by 6 all i need to do is to double my answer of this this and we are doing that because 3 is half of 6
so doubling one factor keeping the other one the same does what for the product it i was like no but i thought i did but i did not want to say anything no i wrote it down so that people can point it out wrong so said we should add it together so let us continue finishing up
and that would be what 96 96 so you see this product is half of this this product is double this because this factor has been doubled it is about doing it once we did it 2 times and that is how we got this so when you are solving problems be looking for a relationship
sometimes in a test they give you 2 problem that are related slate 0 i already solved this problem already i know that this is 16 in the 1st problem problem and anything that is different is that this one is 3 and this is 6 and i know that 6 and 3 are related because 3 is half of 6
so when i doubled the answer for this i got this i do not have to start all over again to solve before so this is one of the strategy that you use in multiplication
when you are solving problem always try to see which ones are related and which ones are not discussion miss sit down so 6 is double of 3 and you have explained it using pictures array and context
question so if miss s wanted to put away 16 she wanted to put away apples and she had 6 shelves she can put 16 apples on each shelf but if the size of her shelf decreases to 3 she can still put away 16 apples but she will need 2 shelves of 3 in order to able to put away all her apples
yes you could just subtract if you put 6 take away 3 and you get 3 we can get 3 but we are doing we are trying to find this because it is half but we are looking at doubling this to get this problem so that we do not have to start all over again to solve it we can just do 48 +48 if you these 2 problems in a pair
now let us quickly look at the next one this is problem one f on your page 53 15 times 8 and 30 times 4 so what is the answer to 15 times 8 let us look at this and see how this problem is solved
go to your seat if you come into the classroom will you please hurry up now so 15 by 8 and 30 by 4 how are they related and how are they different
i want you to solve that problem and i am giving a few minutes to solve it cubes i have tiles i have array paper use any of these tools can be used as well as a story context to solve and prove it
array if you already drew an array if that was the problem you chose for page 54 that is fine
but if you are not doing so you can do so now in your math journal solve it draw an array of pictures or build it using cube representation to show us whether it is true or not
problem solve your who finished it in their page 53 and you give all the answers may i answer the part to 120 120 so the answer is 120
120 so can we say that 15 times 8 equals 30 times 4 can we say that yes is it true at i want you to do it 1st and then we share how can we justify how can we justify that 15 times 8 is the same as 30 times 4
it is equivalent the word is equivalent is that for homework it was page 53 which we done in class on monday it you can use cubes to build it draw if you want graph paper i will give you graph paper
but make sure you are looking what is i want to justify that it is true paper yeah give this to
anybody on that table give it to them nobody on this table solved page 53 different yes your answers are the same situation how are they related and how can you justify that relationship
how can you prove that is true to convince somebody paper you want to draw an array of that or you want to be build a cube cubes the 2 well 3 of you can work together i will send the right cubes are you working together as a team because we will not have enough for everybody to do this if i want
well you have just 2 more minutes if you do not sit too then i will send you out of the class too
somebody that is graph paper want and i have if you are doing graph paper i have a ruler
remember do not try to make all the lines or boxes in the array use array so just mark out the outline if you need ruler
so if you are building cube towers you need to build it or use array to show it
10 if you are going to make a group just make sure that they still remain in group by color no we are not making patterns i do not want you to separate them in single single cubes just pick out what no need to make up what you have
4 can i just add 30 times how can you go from 15 by 8 started with 15 by 8 and see how you can show 15 by 8 into 30 times 4
i know which one is part i know you are building 15 groups of 8 or 8 groups of 15 do 15 groups of 8 will be faster to build 15 so do that and show how you can manipulate it to create 30 by 4
you know what i do not want you guys to build it individually child work together as a team to build it making how many are you making are you making 15 groups of 8 or 8 groups of 15
teacher are you doing the 1st expression yes which one are you trying to build my question 15 by 8 8 you are building 15 by 8 and then you are going to show me how you can transform that to be 30 by 4
here so you are doing 15 by 8 and you break it apart 15 i broke apart the 8 and no but this is where you put your line break you start from where the dimension that you are trying to break
down if it is on this side you have to go across factors you are breaking up the 8 i can see did so and that will give you now what 15 and if i break if you break this up into 2
do hmmm if i multiply 15 times 4 which is 60 so how did you get 30 in here if this is 15 times 4 this is supposed to be 15 times 4 right so how did you put that in there teacher yeah look this is 30
30 this is 30 if i cut 30 in half like that if you cut them in half this would be 15 times 81 this side would be if i cut it 30 if you cut the 30 by 15 this would be this would be 15 times 4 8 think about it
back you know what you are trying to say but you do not know how to communicate it yes i have said that you 3 can work together do not use up the whole cubes so that others can see what to use i wonder why this one here when you have the whole here it is okay no it is not okay because it is going to take us time to put it back together we will do it
yes huh you disagree i disagree because when i did this and got i got you are reversing your number 8 we are saying that 15 by 8 you say equivalent to 30 by 4
here when you add it up when you do 30 by 4 we have 15 by 8 times let me see i have done 30 by 8 and i do not have any 30 by 8 up there you are making the mistake so fix it
it teacher we did not do this one yesterday well i was not here yesterday that was done on monday work monday monday yeah you were here so you are just solving your own too
are you have to do this that is what is on the board so you can be part of the discussion you have 5 more minutes 5 more minutes to look at it yes i just found out that if i add this 2 times i can get 30 do how did we go from 15 by 8 to 30 by 4
think about that 1st how did we move from that 15 which other word can we use in multiplication we look teacher double what word we doubled so we doubled 15 to get 30
and what did we do to the 8 to get 4
4 so let me give a graph to show you better yeah can i have you are not doing anything i do not know why you are not doing work
problem yeah you do not have your math journal you do not have the math journal where is your math journal i do not have it can i get the paper are you really going of this lesson to the end of each it does not show me that you are really ready for this you see them down there you do not have the worksheet people are asked to do it in their journal and they are doing it in their journal and you are sitting down there sucking your finger
equals are you going to be an observer in the class or you going to be part of the class and doing the work to share with the others you need to get to work work so you said that 15 was doubled to get 30 and then 8 was halved to get 4
so can you draw your 15 by 8 here 1st right up here you know you can also draw if it keeps making this and it is going to be difficult because i do not think we will have up to 30 do we have 30 there let us draw the marker right on the back of it start with 8 by do not have to draw it to fill up the page because you are going to show how it transforms to 30 by 4
teacher yeah can i get eraser i do not know do i have any eraser where is it to are we finished by using cube cube what are you figuring out with the cube we are done i just i already put them back together what did you do it and then draw your sketch in your books be ready to share with the class
do how did you prove that 15 by 8 is equivalent to 30 by 4 doing should you start by building 15 by 8 we did i did not see it
did well what did you do to it to show 30 by 4 what did you do because you are going to share with the class let me see what that group is doing there yes and half of 30 is 15
class you are going to draw it on the board
let me give you have a marker there it is over here are you transforming here where is the black one here teacher yes
well if i put the 4 i put words up there that can help you to explain what you are doing if i plus the that will equal 8 so 15 times 8 15 which one is 15
this line cannot be 15 at the same time and 30 at the same time you cannot there is only one yeah can we get the construction paper use construction paper or graph paper paper and then no i want you to show we are proving why this is true it you are paper would this be all right what i did to get the no you said that when you doubled this you get 30
30 when you half that you get this so can you have how you will double if to transform here this yeah so show me how you are going to have this you are going to cut it down here right do the cutting let us see ruler right here so you cut this how
half i am not going to tell you where to cut it in half teacher i do not know what to do here you do not know what to do i did the problem on the board it is one f there one f on that page 53 one f and you could 15 times 4
now that is going to be you have cut this long side into 2 equal parts you said if we cut the 8 you get 4 4 and then so how with math do we transform
picture now this is 2 do you remember that this is when we are playing the game big array small array so this is our big array are you trying to create 2 small arrays inside it 4 and this is what 15 by 4
it so now we want to show how this so you see you have this and this so when you draw this i gave you the one on the board when you cut your array in half and you move if you move this piece and put it here if you move this piece and it put it here now this side remained the same right this one here to here is still 15 here do that just draw the broken line 1st to show it
eacher you do not have to right why do you have all this 0 you should use 2 different colors to show the line that you put in that was because it was not there before
before this draw the line that mark at the 30 so it will stand out is that where the 30 was originally 30s the 30s are in line so which portion shows it now highlight them so that we will see where you cut it into 2
so it can stand out looking so good so this is your and then now cut it in half 4 this is also so for every one you got 2 out of for every one you got 2 out of ooh that is nice so now what would be done so this done you have moved over here
so what would be this from here to here would be what length from here to here what is the length what is the dimension from here to here what is the measure of this length this is the rectangle you have moved it down here and this side and this side are the same as this side right so what is the dimension of this side the sides here well see i moved this from here to here is still the same thing like from here to here
true is this one here and this are the same 44 hmmm it is going to be no what would be the dimension of your rectangle you already have this will be 4 here because this is this portion this is this part right so this side will also be 4
true so i got to do this side which is this side here and this is the other side here what would be the dimension 15 so is that the same distance yes is that the same distance 15 put it here now what is 15 +15 30 now do you see how you have transformed it
it put a line to show the go like this so just a line from here has been doubled it has doubled move it there for 15 30 that is 30 30 so i am seeing here you cut this in half and you have shortened this side to 4
4 yes and then you swing this over here to make a longer triangle which you now have a longer length of 15 and a shorter one of
transformation yes do you lose anything no because we arrange it and that is why you are saying here that 15 times 8 which is this 15 times 8 the original thing is same thing as 30 times 4 4 do you see that can you explain this to me and you explain what you just did
i cut you cut in half i did half of 8 to make 30 times 4 and i moved that so you know you have 2 rectangles and you move one of the rectangle down here to create a longer rectangle a longer rectangle and with one longer dimension and a short dimension
so now you have this one has doubled and this side has been reduced so i have teacher if i the goal is to use 15 +15
6 and then i am not asking you to solve it
120 the goal was for you to justify that when you 11 side from half the other factor you create 2 expression that have the same value
do and then it was like this so then it was +15 equals 30 and then 30 times 4 now how can you transform this to look as 30 times 4 because this length here is still 15
30 what would you do to do you can now you have take the bottom half and move it all the way good so you take the bottom half and move it all the way move here so you have broken it into 2 and show me good we have 2 more minutes
out what did you guys find out with cubes well the few that use cubes make sure you are prepared to share i do not understand you just want a piece of paper you would have it on piece of paper else you can highlight it if you want to with marker so you will share what have you been doing what have you been doing he has been doing ca ca what have you been doing
i did 15 times 8 and i cut it in half you did 15 by 8 yeah you cut in half and how did that show 30 by 4 now what will you need to do to show 30 by 4 from this add those 2 together how will you add it 15 you started with 15 by 8 but you want to transform it into 30 by 4
your 1st move was to cut your 8 in half and you created 2 shorter lengths so how can you show the 30 now what can you do you have 2 small arrays now to show a 30 by 4 you know can also draw it on the back using an amount array 4 i can add 15 and 15 and then you add the 15
but how will you show it to be one rectangle how will you do that yes you can add your 15 by 15 but how will you move this so like you show me that 15 by 15 added together how can you do that put it this way you can move which one move it to this side move one of them to this side or all of them one of them move one of the rectangles
want i can give you scissors to cut it but you have to show it as it is and then show the new one with the cut part want me to give you the scissors to do that yeah and then you can put it on construction paper use this yes no safety scissors so now you are going to draw 2 this is how it was when you 1st cut it up
4 so now you are going to reproduce it here one this one show that how you transformed it and i cut in this one no you are not going to cut this one draw the same thing here and then you cut one of them out and stick it together on my yeah to i will be back
give me my papers yes are you done how are you making the transformation from 15 by 8 to 30 by 8 8 30 by 4 sorry 15 by 8 to 30 by 4 how are you doing it how are you doing the transformation hmmm you are still thinking
we are going to share out up please use that color so that the camera can catch what you are doing you did the transformation you have to show what it looked like before then you redraw it to show the move move which one did you move
i can now still see 30 by 4 because i need to see them together you move this over there so that is on your now will be 30 so this but you can make it better than this son you can make it better than this it was not really sure but this side is still longer than this side so draw it here draw the transformation here you need one that you look like so that there will be and then you have to see sure the for your 15 by 4
i do not want you to use this color you only that color that is too light if you draw it on the paper explain what you did it is this right or is it wrong let me see is it wrong yes
equivalent they are not the same they are equivalent they are not the same because we use so numbers they are equivalent equivalent let us see yours those of you who are yet using the cube i did not see what you did with your cube with your cube pieces what did you do with the cube we put it in towers of 15 of what and put it in tower this is not 15
put it together to stand together you have to stick them together i want to see yes we are going to be sharing out our time is running out we are going to share yeah
up hurry up and then we will come back together to share equivalent are you looking at the marker or you are supposed be doing work with this time is passing yes i am done you are done
did you used i thought you were trying to prove how you made that 15 by 8 is equivalent to 30 by 4 you were using cubes to model that what did you do with the cubes and how did you show it cause i did not see it it looked like you were just breaking them apart and solving problem with it your goal was to use the cube to justify that 15 by 8 is 30 by 4
how can you prove that how did you what did you people build did you make 15 groups of 8 or 8 groups of 15 which one because i do not see it here
5s how did 5 come into play yes you already have to show this because i already know the answer knowing the answer is not the problem knowing the answer is justifying that your answer is true
true you guys are talking about other things here you and i do not know i thought i heard do it on the paper i did how i did it
if you do it on paper that is not let me see if i can find on that color i just a different paper let me find a different background this marker i do not you to lose the cap
you have to put it i want you to put it you have to put the dimension so you can share we are going to share hurry up out where is it 8 i can do that now do i have a paper excuse me me excuse me i do not have a paper because you took it and gave it to
hurry up let us go and share out one you have to use better color to highlight it so we show how it transform i do not have one of these papers which i need you have it show it can go sideways no it can not go sideways how will it fit
fit an array is a rectangle do not argue who did here both of you sit i am just going to go sit down go to your seat go to your seat go sit down sit down sit down i said sit down i am sitting down you are not sitting down yet
down finish up now put the dimension of your new rectangle wait what side is 30 this side obviously let it be me let us just go like this so you can see it from any angle it is different make it darker now use the marker and that would be
make a double that will be you have 4 now so you went from this this one was what 15 8 so this was the original 15 by 8 so you cut this and moved one of this over and you made a longer rectangle yes that is now 30 by 4
up we are going to share out why are you here why are here talking to them our time is up our time is up
we have to come and share time is we are going to come together and share i know that some people worked with cube i want you to leave your cube towers the way they are share we are ready for sharing back there and you need to come up front
carry your thing so i said excuse me i mean are you still doing this so teacher can i make one so remember this one like you said is 30 by 4
so why are you doing that but this is still 15 by 4 30 then now the new dimension now that is where you have to redraw it to show that 30 by so you are supposed to move no
4 but i did not ask you so this is originally 8 by 15 dimensions that is why it is not coming out clearly and you do not have you can make there is a book and see what you are doing line teacher can i get a dark color that is a dry erase
i will take the black one the black is on the overhead there the black is on the easel forget about it for now can you go sit down sit down until i call you to share please go to the rug for sharing our time is running out
rug am i doing this can i do this homework sit down people sit down let us come and share i said presentation that is all i will get them all in
where is the other sheet you need to bring the other sheet where you started to show the transformation so shhh i need people to come and settle down up settle down
down so the goal was for you to justify using other cubes array model picture of a diagram or a story context to prove or to justify that 15 by 8 is equivalent to 30 by 4
and i saw some people really working hard making sense of what was happening sometimes true question and they were able to think through the action that was happening cubes cubes to prove it but they did not they do not build it to the front expression they built 15 by 8 and they did 30 by 4
they did not justify with their cube we are going to have them make sense of that as we all learn together now i am going to call was the 1st person that finished he drew a picture so i want him to come up and share with the class what he did please pick up so that your classmates and please respect the speaker respect the speaker so tell them what you did 1st
we have 4 boxes that which have 30 inside of them so he did 30 by 41st next then i cut it in half that is in the middle of the 30s which is 15 and then there is 8 boxes now in each box does that make sense it is half you went from 4 groups of 30 to 8
to 8 groups of 30 and he still have the same total do you see that yeah that is one way to prove it so you can see the 15s inside the 30 you can see how the number changed then we now have we will now have 15 15s
there were 8 boxes but when we have 30 we will have more inside the boxes we will have fewer boxes to put them in so we have 4 boxes to put 30 things in but one will change the size of the box just like miss s yesterday trying to put away those apples when she started with 15 boxes of 6 then she now changed the size of the boxes
18 when she realized that she could only fit in 14 apples inside the boxes she needed more she needed 6 boxes to put away all her apples here you had a big box that will hold 30 apples sir you had a big box that could hold 30 apples now the size of the box has changed
you only have 4 boxes to put in all your 30 apples now you got a new consignment that you need to ship out the boxes are smaller this time they can only hold 15 apples each they can only hold 15 apples so you would need more of those you will need 8 boxes 8 of those small boxes to put away the same 120 apples thank you we are going to leave it hanging here now the next person used array used array to show his own
i am not you are not ready yet no i am not c also drew she drew an amount array and then she showed them what it did started 1st i drawed a 15 by 8 array so she 1st of all drew the 15 by 8 array then i look at the words
4 then i move one of your rectangle i move one of my rectangles to make the longer dimension and the shorter dimension and this equals 15 so i add both of them up and i got 30 so do you see the transformation you can see the transformation how you went from 15 by 8 to a more skinny rectangle that is now 30 by 4
do you see that your eye is not here away so do you see the transformation that is taking place yeah it went from 15 by 8 by cutting up the 8 8 you now have 2 small arrays 15 by 4 and 15 by 4 and then you should drag one of the 15 by 4 to make the to the other side
here and now she has 2 15 by 4 stretched out so she had 2 15 by 4s standing on their short side now when you find out that 15 by 4 this side is 15 right 30 if i have to draw the new array without this line in the middle this line is going to now be 30 4 so it is now transformed from 15 by 8 to now 30 by 4
do you see the transformation that is justification true you start with one and from that one you get the other one you do not build a new one completely you move from and change conform that one to look like the other expression so the same thing you are packing things in the boxes
now so this one is a more skinnier rectangle than this so the dimension here is longer and the other side is shorter so we doubled the 15 to get the 30 and we halved our 8 to get the 4 person was doing something similar and he worked hard on his too yes
give me your cube i did the same thing as but i just did 15 times 8 but i put up i halved the 8 to 4 and then i moved the 15 times 4 to here to make it 30
30 times 4 and then i just did the so his own is similar to even though he started with the skinnier rectangle but 1st the fact is that he started with 15 by 8 now he knew to cut his 8 in half and drag one of the piece now where you cut it in half you are creating 2 small array just like when we are playing the big array small array game
so he now one of these rectangles to the other side to stretch it extending the other dimension by 15 so that will be 15 +15 to give you the now new dimension of 30 z yes share yours you drew the arrays with all the squares in
yes the 1st thing that the teacher told us to do is 15 times 8 4 i mean in arrays so i did 15 times i mean you did the 15 by 8 8 and what would you do cut it in half and i added it here in this 30
4 so he also started but he used the grid paper to show that it is actually true so he has 8 by 15 or 15 by 8 array now he cuts the 8 in half to create 4 by 15 and 4 by 15
and he dropped one of the 4 by 15 to make to attach to the other one to make a longer skinnier rectangle which now is has the dimension of 30 by 4 transformation if you want to really prove it you can count the cubes the squares inside the array
area so this is the same square area as this even though they are it looks skinnier but you still have the same number of square units inside here and the same number of square unit inside there to show that it is equivalent do you have any question no
here we are going to hang them up so that we can use that to remember because you are going to continue working on this activity tomorrow by looking at all the similar problems where you can use the of doubling and halving now the people that use cube people that use cube that did not complete their work
when you use cube you are going to do the same thing you build the 15 by 81st and then you cut it in half and attach the halves to stretch it to show the 30 by 4 array but i was really happy that was able to use just a lot of pictures to show the transformation
now one thing that i want to stress out before we dismiss is that when you are doing multiplication these are some of the strategies that you are going to be looking out for to use now you can only do doubling and halving to create an easier problem to solve this problem and this problem which one is easier to solve mentally
4 you can solve this in your head without doing that is why we are excuse me let me finish that is why we are looking for strategies strategies that will help us to be to get to our answer quickly without wasting too much time efficient ones so some problems we offer you the opportunity to do this some will not
if we have 2 odd numbers we will try to have we are going to end up with a fraction which would make the work more difficult to solve right so we do not do that so you have to know when to use a strategy this one is easy because i know when i double 15 i will get a 10s number
and working with 10s numbers are easier because when you are multiplying you just ignore the 0 and multiply the nonzero digit with the other factor
and then put back the 0 when you are finished that is why we can do this in our head if i have a number like 79 times 27 i am not going to do doubling and halving because i am going to create one of the numbers will now become a fraction number so we use those opportunities when we have an even number and an odd number factor that we can double to create the 10s number
or when we have 2 even numbers because we know we can always have an even number without having a fraction or part left over so as work on more we are going to continue this work tomorrow as we look at other activity page 61 and 62 where you will be looking at this information more
latin we are going to do more work about place value breaking numbers apart by 10 so that you get grounded on that strategy before you begin to apply this so the old rule is when you are given a story situation or a problem context or a problem that is working with numbers or with words you try to see relationship between and among the numbers in the problem
do not just rush and try solving it all from this question try to see if there is any way that the numbers are related and use that relationship that you identify to figure out the solution clear yeah now our homework is going to be page 63 64 we are going to continue working on that as we continue this discussion of multiplication strategies any question does anybody have question i have not dismissed the class yet
you are already out of your seat that is not right you can those of you who are on the floor here quietly go back to your seats thank you for disrupting the lesson throughout the day go back to your seat now you can go back to your can now go back to your seat thank you sir thank you very much
hand 3 tenths 3 tenths times what s this number i m waiting for an answer times what s this number who can help out h 5 tenths 5 tenths so we have 3 tenths times 5 tenths now let s figure out what 3 tenths times 5 tenths is
1st we should see if decimals not in multiplication you have to add i mean multiply the 5 and the 3rd and what is 5 times 31515 so we write down 15 all right do what s the trick for multiplication of decimals
j decimals in the problem and how many are to the right in the problem one how many 12 okay so how many have to be to the fight in the answer 22 so where should i place that decimal point should i place it so that there are 2 places to the right of the decimal point
f to the . left so you want 2 places to the left okay all right so we have been able to figure out that 3 tenths times 5 tenths is what 15 hundredths 15 hundredths okay 15 hundredths so i m going to write this out
3 tenths times 5 tenths equals 15 hundredths okay now i m going to give you a sheet of paper that has one large square on it okay
one this is one whole square that i ve given you okay out pass them down to each other please and what i want you to do 1st is i want you to get in your brain that this is one how man little teeny tiny squares has this one thing been chopped into
h one hundredths 10 by 10 grid okay all right i do believe it s time for you to leave for your next class so you can scoot right out this door okay honey we ll see you back here for writing okay
you re going to go through there and out and around to your classroom okay
right now what i want you to do is i want you to put some special eyeglasses on and take away all the horizontal lines i want you to just look at the lines that are vertical if you were to slice that vertically how many strips would you have 1234 yeah v
10 so if we were to divide it that way it would be this one thing would be divided into what
j 101010 to hundredths tenths tenths it would be divided into tenths okay out and our one square has been divided into tenths
now i want everybody to turn their paper this way okay again what would our one square be divided into okay tenths because this is one thing okay
when you were little in 1st grade that 1st grade teacher she told you that this was worth 100 and you counted 1234 remember
okay and we still can count that there are 100 here but since we are looking at the one thing it is divided into hundredths all right so now i want you to take those glasses off and put on your hundredths glasses turn the paper back the way it is and i want you to look at the hundredths that this has been divided into
okay all right so what we re going to do is we re going to model our multiplication problem 3 tenths so i want everybody to take like a reddish maybe pink colored pencil i want you to color in tenths 3 tenths to show the 3 tenths
so let s have teacher h s borrow s pencil for just a 2nd i m sorry s and let s have you watch what i m doing okay
watch i m going to color in 3 tenths so i m lightly going to shade 123 to show 3 tenths got it
it okay now what we re going to do is we re going to shade 5 tenths but there s a trick to this and you need to listen so if you are not done shading in your 3 tenths put your pencil down for a minute and eyes up here i want you to choose a yellow or a blue
a yellow or a blue okay and i m going to borrow somebody s yellow from over here you okay and now what i m going to do eyes up here is i m going to turn this just like we practiced i m going to shade in 5 tenths okay
ready i ve got my 3 tenths going this way now i m going to shade my 5 tenths there s 12345 so i have turned my paper and i have shaded one
questions when you are finished i want you to turn your paper and here where you wrote 3 tenths i then want you to write times 5 tenths just like that in 5 are you going to do it right next to the 3 you just did
way that s good enough it doesn t have to be perfect now turn it and do your other color
yourself make sure you ve got 3 tenths colored in one way way okay all right keep going get it done okay now those of you that are finished we re going to talk a little bit about art
colors what do you know i need you to color okay colors and what happens when you mix 2 primary colors together h they become a different primary color not a primary color they become a secondary color don t they
color what 2 colors can you mix together to make a 3rd color of our blue yellow and red j yellow blue and yellow make green anybody else know any 2 that go together that make something different e red and blue make red and blue make purple don t they and there s one other one
orange okay now we chose the primary color red okay down hands up if you were a yellow person this morning okay if you were a yellow person when you mixed red and yellow together you should have gotten orange
if you were a blue person when you mixed red and blue together you should have gotten purple now this isn t perfect because it s not paint pencils however if you look very closely at teacher h s example you can see this is the yellow that represented 5 tenths this is the red that represented 3 tenths
then i have this orange here and i know you re thinking teacher h that isn t really orange but it s different than the red and it s different than they yellow isn t it show okay see the red and the blue
purple okay it s not a perfect purple but it made we know what we re talking about okay so now at the bottom of your paper you should have 3 tenths times 5 tenths written make sure that your decimal points are prominent so that we can see them
coloring make sure that at the bottom it says 3 tenths times 5 tenths everybody stop coloring make sure at the bottom it says 3 tenths times 5 tenths okay now we re ready to put an equal sign next to our problem 3 tenths times 5 tenths equaled what look at the board if you can t remember or can t find it in your brain right now
15 hundredths 1500s 15 hundredths so everybody put an equal sign and then put 15 hundredths now when you write your 15 hundredths you have to make sure that you put that decimal point in front of the one okay you got it sweetie all right so this is what you should have
this is a model of 3 tenths times 5 tenths equals 15 hundredths now where does this 15 hundredths come in what i want you to do is i want you to look at either the purple part or the orange part on your paper then i want you to put those glasses on that allows you to see both lines going both ways i want you to count the tiny hundredths squares
123456 keep counting counted you know what you re doing counted everybody ready
f all right you ready there 1515 isn t that cool seat all right so we have modeled that 3 tenths times 5 tenths equals 15 hundredths you got it all right now what i m going to do is i m going to give you a sheet of paper that has a bunch of little 100 squares on them okay
and what i want you to do is i want you to make up a problem that is some number of tenths times some number of tenths equals whatever number of hundredths okay so say in your head you say to yourself okay self i want to do 2 tenths times 7 tenths okay
so you re going to take one of these little squares and you re going to color in 2 tenths going this way and 7 tenths going this way and then 2 tenths times 7 tenths would be how many hundredths yes 14 hundredths 14 hundredths and then i want you to count either your purple or your yellow okay and i want you to make sure that you have that number of hundredths all right
so we re going to do one and when you have that one done i want you to cut out the hundredths square okay so you re going to have a little tiny square got it if you finish before somebody else finishes you ve got a couple more 100th squares that you can practice on and do another problem on
don t write your problem on your 100th s square though because we re going to pass these around and we re going to try to figure out what the problem is that s being modeled by our drawing okay now now this does not have to be picasso or rembrandt this is just a quick quick zippa de do da kind of coloring
day we don t want to waste all of our time with that done what can we use can we color you can use any 2 colors but know that the 2 that the 3 primary colors are going to work best but you can you can definitely try purple times orange and get mud
okay see what happens great we re going to get them passed out to the people that need them okay there s a whole bunch coming yes did you pass them all yes
didn t grab them all 123 oops sorry that s okay all right gentlemen here we go okay good job
looking good looks cool doesn t it do are you going to start with that one
okay so let s pick a certain number of tenths and then turn it the other way and do a different number of tenths actually you don t have to do a different number of tenths you could do 2 tenths times 2 tenths okay if you don t have scissors on your desk raise your hand
and whatever you messed up on don t worry about erasing them that s why i gave you lots of number squares okay okay on you just need one okay and while we re waiting for others to get done you can work on a 2nd one
3 tenths okay so to do 3 tenths you ve got to color in 110th 2 tenths 3 tenths and then you ve got to turn it the other way and color in 110th 3 tenths okay so what i need you to do is start over here all right and do brown 1st or red
red make it 3 tenths okay so i want you to do all the way across 110th 2 tenths 3 tenths then you re going to turn it and do 2 tenths in brown all the way across okay sweetie good job that looks lovely mud you knew good job
pretty all right little one yep did you color in 5 tenths yep no okay that s it
yeah because you have to color in the tenths right okay that s an interesting little situation there so you ve got how many tenths there 3 yellow tenths and how many red tenths 55 tenths and so then does that turn out to be 15 tenths because it s not up at the edge is it
sorry 15 hundredths but is it still 15 hundredths count them are there still 15 yes so is it a good model it yes do you think it would work if you split up the yellow even more
like if you colored the top 10th and the middle 10th and the bottom 10th work you know what i m asking you instead of coloring these 3 together if you colored one yellow 10th here one yellow 10th here and one yellow 10th here would it sill work no why don t you try it and see while you re waiting you re test
what are you finished okay now those of you that are finishing up i want you to cut out your major best model okay and i want you to come and get a blue piece of paper from teacher h then i want you to paste your little model onto the blue paper like this
okay have it going this way and put it like this h that s a different model though isn t it
beautiful behind the camera yep all right so now we re pasting the little huh
i already got one for all right 0 perfect teacher h can we do it like this you got to have tenths though you have to color in purple tenths you colored in red tenths and then you stopped you have to go all the way across 0
thumb yeah that s right but you got to paste it a little bit lower it looks like tenths and 2 tenths anybody need glue sticks can you i got some i got one come get it
okay share the glue sticks guys who needs a all right now what we re going to do is we re going to divide into small groups okay
and we re going to pass our papers and we re going to talk about what multiplication with decimal problem we think our friends have modeled okay so let me just divide you into groups 1st all right so i want and and you 3 to be in a group
h all right you 4 are a group okay and let s see okay you 4 on the end
group you 1234 are a group you 4 are a group you 3 are a group okay we have our groups
ready all right the 1st thing i want you to do is i want you to turn your paper over and i want you to print your name on the back so we know which is yours are you ready okay paste it down okay here you go good job
ready everybody got your name on the back all right i got a lot of stuff okay now the next thing that i want you to do is i want you when you write your name i want you to circle it or underline it or put my little cloud thing around it like that okay
it underline it or something so that we know that this is yours because we re going to do some more writing on the back of this okay right now what i want everybody to do is everybody ready guys yeah do you have your name on the back
no i just got all right quick quick quick quick quick okay here s what we re going to do ready i want you to pass your paper in a circle around your group watch is going to hand his to and take s e goes to s goes to
understand yes so you guys are going to be crossing around okay paper excellent now you have somebody else s paper correct ready i want you to look at that problem i want you to think so what problem is this
what multiplication decimal problem is this then i want you to turn the paper over and i want you to write the problem and then i want you to put your initials next to what you write so for example here s your piece of paper that you have
over it s going to have a name okay and you me jh i m going to look at this and i m going to say i think that is showing me 7 tenths times 2 tenths equals 14 hundredths and then next to it i m going to write jh
then i m going to pass the paper to the same person i just passed my paper to when you get the new one look at it over on the back underneath where your friend just wrote what they thought it was you write what you think it is
so you may get this paper and be like yeah i think that s 7 tenths times 2 tenths as well you may get it and say man what kind of nonsense is this that s not 7 tenths times 2 tenths it s 3 tenths times 8 tenths and i think that equals 24 hundredths and put your initials by it and pass it on
you understand what you re doing excellent that s because they . red did you use 2 colors did you use 3 colors make it all brown this brown cover up as well huh
how come you used 3 colors buddy huh reddish brown times blue okay mud right all right does that help yes
okay very interesting okay get them passed figure it out and as soon as you get it written pass it on
pass did you pass did you pass yep okay did you do it
out you re did you color in yellow tenths already or did you stop see this is 110th all the way across see see 110th all the way across easier to read isn t it
if your group finished before they do you can work on another one okay so we re getting you guys you guys are group okay
group yeah because you have 5 in the group so if you 5 finish then surely the ones with 4 in their group will finish what honey you re finished
okay what all right clap once if you can hear my voice eyes on me one yes you are welcome to paste the 2nd one on the front of your blue sheet low if for some reason you would have 3 done i think you ve got room to paste 3
just keep them spread out because eventually we re going to write very neatly what the problem is the multiplication decimal problem is that we ve modeled okay all right are you guys done yes all right is this group finished s group finished yeah s group i m sorry s group done yes s group done yes all right good
question then you may leave and go to the restroom sign out okay all right now you got it ready okay if you are working on another one please stop working on the other one everybody in the room should be finished and everybody should have their own paper back again stop working on your 2nd or 3rd one
everybody should be finished you should have at least one done
now what i want you to do is i want you to say to yourself self self what problem was i trying to represent and then i want you to turn it over and i ant you to see if the problems that your friend thought it was was the one you were trying to represent okay now how many of you right on
do excellent okay those of you that aren t raising your hands do we have any questions
h some people got the problem confused because the quotient was 10 but they did 10 times 210 times equals 20 hundredths but the problem was 5 tenths +2 tenths times 2 tenths times not plus
times so 5 tenths times 2 tenths equals how many hundredths and did some people say that it was equal to 110th no some people said it was 20 tenths okay was your coloring clear huh okay talk to the people who s initials are next to those and find out what they were thinking let them look at it again and you guys talk it out okay
concerns what you got 0 they forgot the decimal and did they have 9 hundredths or 9 tenths wow that s interesting
all had 3 tenths times 3 tenths and her friends said that that was 900 s gasping m i forgot to put the decimal so if they just put a decimal would they be correct
up because to be less huh you have to have 2 decimal places to the left i m sorry to the right because there are 2 places so we start here and we go boing and then what
put a 00 the hero and go boing and then we put the decimal point this says 3 tenths times 3 tenths is 9 what hundredths hundredths this said 3 tenths times 3 tenths was 9 tenths and that s not correct it has to be hundredths and if you count the little teeny tiny 100th squares you ll find that there are 9 of them okay
questions okay now this is what we re going to do the final thing that we are going to do
in your very best perfect 5th grade handwriting with a dark colored colored pencil you are going to print very neatly and quite large look at my fingers quite large so that we can see it from across the hall because we re going to put these out in the hall
large i want you to print the multiplication decimal problem that you modeled okay and i have modeled 7 tenths times 2 tenths i m going to write 2 problems
i m 1st going to write 7 tenths times 2 tenths equals 14 hundredths and then i m going to switch it around and i m going to put 2 tenths times 7 tenths equals still 14 hundredths what property is represented there
s commutative commutative property because remember you commute back and forth what division and . division and excellent so very nicely get it printed okay yes
because when we did it i can t hear you what honey equals 25 hundredths so you re going to write .5 times .5 equals 25 hundredths decimal .25
why because it s the yeah the factors are the same right so you got off easy cheesy all right make sure your decimal points are prominent if you re writing in marker make sure that you re doing it correctly remember i held up my fingers and i said numbers this big like these make sure that your numbers are this big
no whoa that s good enough excellent okay that s this one do it down here for this one now okay guys if you have 5 tenths times 5 tenths brought up the fact equals 25 hundredths do you have to switch it around and do the commutative property h because they re already the same the factors are the same right okay
all right when you have it finished i would like for you to bring it to me back then i need you to get your calendar math book out and i need you to join me on the floor for calendar math
yep absolutely these look great you guys excellent good job cool all right what were your directions
remember calendar book right and join teacher h on the floor obviously for calendar you re going to need your pencil your brain and your calendar book
tv now do you have 2 tenths times 4 tenths equals 8 hundredths i have 2 let s get it correct h do you have 4 tenths times read that problem to me
14 tenths times equals is that what you are saying what did you to say excellent love it job excellent huh
you need to have this all the way across yellow because remember we did tenths remember so yellow yellow yellow yellow okay then we need 4 tenths not 4 decimal point decimal point equals 16 hundredths where are you going to put the decimal point for the 16 hundredths okay so you got 2 things you need to do
color yellow and decimal points okay sweetie and then hand it in much better thank you okay whoa whoa whoa i need you to put a decimal point there remember do you want this to say 3 tenths times 9 tenths equals 27
go sorry it s all right i m waiting for everybody to get over to the calendar math area
you guys back here need your calendar books so we need could you please get s calendar book and hand that to her d
now excellent i m waiting on you sweetheart good job
excellent excellent excellent all right i hope everybody is seated the way we re supposed to be you guys have pencils back there calendar books you all set let s go sweetheart come on gentlemen shh
here actually that s s chair so should be allowed to sit there honey
chair all right now before we begin calendar math i want to quickly end our little model of multiplication lesson
i want to talk to you about what we just did and how that worked and what the deal was so i want you to turn to your elbow buddies and i want you to talk about what we just did and what that meant to you and what that showed you in math
now make sure that you re talking math you may say the same thing thing okay hands up if your elbow buddy said something fabulous to you that you need to share with us
c my buddy said showed him the primary colors how colors love it what mathematical thing did we learn yes
how when we do our math how like the how like we get . when we shade in we get it equals okay it s right in front of you isn t it h how to multiply the ones that you colored it and then where it makes a different color on the calendar that s the very good
right if you had like times 33 and had like 9 tenths huh do you have 9 tenths or do you have 9 hundredths 9 okay a 0 a 9 you have to have 2 places to the right of that decimal point if there s 2 places to the right in the answer right okay
i m glad that that how many of you really saw that clearly and now can kind of picture what that kind of looks like okay excellent well we re going to move onto calendar math now and we re going to start with today tuesday yes excellent all right look how smart you are
okay so it s the 25th day of september all right raise your hand if you can look at our pattern and come up with what you think is going to be the next pattern on our calendar minute we didn t do this for awhile it was a test got a guess
what do you think obtuse angle go so you think it s going to be an obtuse triangle starting from the top okay different what do you think
triangle a star star what do you think i think it s going to be a triangle with dot more
pattern diagonal pattern okay huh you see what he s talking about excellent i wonder what that would mean think triangle with a an acute triangle with a star on top going to go with orange yes orange acute triangle with a star on top
why bud a bing bud a boom what is the 25th of december me multiples of 5 have a what that 5101015 where is it
15202525 what would the next one be another pay attention yes 3030 okay
1015202530 what would the next multiple of 5 be r it has acute sides it has acute sides are you sure
what it has acute angles in it okay right what about the orange orange you look like you re thinking why is it orange
red okay orange orange yellow blue orange orange yellow blue orange orange yellow blue orange orange yellow blue orange orange yellow blue okay now change the colors to letters
bank we re going to the bank do rob the bank all right how much money are we going to get from the bank today on the 25th of september $25000 how did she come up with $25000 the date time a 1000 what kind of number is 1000
i know you know it it s a power of 10 it s a power of 10 number that s what you were trying to come up with the 3rd 10 to the 3rd power what is 10 to the 3rd power mean
 . 10 times 10 times 10
yes guys guys guys no i don t like that i knew you were going to say that
money 25000 we are subtracting from $6679000 so everybody find your giant subtraction problem $25000 all right get it written you ve got $679000 minus $25000
make sure you have your decimal points lined up because it s a subtraction problem go you ready decimal point or decimal point right all right here we go you ready
quattro quattro okay you ve got nothing nadda never 6 minus never what s nadda nadda all right i m putting a comma hey i noticed something on some of your tests
what some of you were putting this decimal point here okay and then you were counting over for the like the 123 comma 123 you know what i m talking about yeah and the placement of the comma 123 and you were putting the comma right there okay the decimal point to the right of the decimal point are 2 places for cents okay
but then when you start with the decimal point this is the whole number 1000s 10000s 100000s and then you would put a comma if there was a 1000000s a digit in the 1000000s place but there s not
right okay so now we re going to go to our bank and we re going to get our $25000 how many 10000s do i need to get it was real easy i didn t have to borrow anything $25005 s 4000 are you sure
no 0 look at it again how much money do you have are you sure that a $1000 no it s not look again a 10000 a 10000 so now you have how much
have 21000 all right how many of these $1000 do we need now
so we re going to do the 5s so everybody on your week 6 week i believe it s 8 according to our calendar we got a new place there and we re going to find a place to skip count it s a new week so this is your next available space flip and you start it s a new week
right and the 1st thing we re going to put is skip counting or now that we re brainiacs we can call it what m multiples multiples so we re going to be writing with multiples of 5 okay so the 1st one is 5 times one is 55 what s the 2nd 110 what s the 3rd one
1515 what s the 4th one m what s the 5th 12525 what s the 6th 130 what s the 7th one
3535 what s the 8th one huh what s the 8th multiple of 54040 what s the ninth one
45 we re going to keep going what s the 10th one m 50 we re going to keep going this is the speed limit 115555 i hear some talking
multiples all right and the 6th one let s go with . the 12th one r 60 okay now we discovered during time that there were 3 different ways to figure out multiples no no
charm what s one way sweetheart that we can figure out these numbers h if teacher h said to you all right we just counted by 5s here what s one way you were thinking like what the next number was what could you come up with add 5 you could add 5 to each number a skip counting 5s and
you could multiply you could multiply by 5 okay so you could either add 5 you could skip count or you can do your multiplication facts okay all right all right we re going to stick with as he points so you ready
go ready 51015202530354045505560 that was perfect okay good job count mouse
going you got 510152025 and you want to keep going but your hand it hurts how could we get our reader to know keep going dot that means continue in the same pattern i always okay what i see that you always see that in a book well see
guys okay now what i want you to do now is you are going to go back to your seat out the back of your math notebook the journal section and i want you to write a paragraph talking about what you learned in math today
time count the time that we modeled the decimal multiplication time write something down that you learned in math today then if you have any questions about what you learned write down a question
notebooks you are going to clear off your desk and you are going to sit down and you are going to write
groups how many marbles would be in each group are solve this problem using 2 different methods
that 5.25 us that sounds like a lot of work
us now how many circles did you end up putting 21 now do you that was her method and that was fine but do you want to have to draw 21 circles
no can you think of more efficient way to represent this problem while is showing us what she did j division you can divide 525 by 525 so she just wants us to do division the way we re used to seeing it
explain i put 21 circles how did you know you needed 21 circles okay
so was trying to make groups of something which was right something let s kind of help her get back on track because if this was an assessment you don t want to spend that much time on one problem
divide we can divide using chunking we want to ask ourselves how many 5s are in 525 for some of you who are really good you don t want to chunk
facts i want to divide like that not a problem or you could just ask yourself okay how many 25s are in 525 well you can break 525 apart if i wanted to break up 525 how could i break that up i don t want to break 525 up into quarters
okay i can take the 52 away how many times 25 goes into 52 up divide i don t want to divide
525 these are the people in my group and i have $525 i want to divide $525 but i want to use big bills how can i divide 525 into big bills
up i heard somebody say in a quarter $525 number i want to see how many 25s are in 525 how can i figure out how many 25s
know how many 25 are in 101 4 numbers add 4 +4
21 so how many times does 25 go into 525 21 what is the width of this segment to the nearest inch okay what do you have on you that tells you about how long an inch is tip about how long is the tip of your thumb
inch so if i were to use my thumb to measure how long about how long would that line be i have 5 6 about now this is on paper about 5
statistics use the following spinner to answer the next question what is the probability of the spinner landing on the number 6 k 4 out of 8
that 1st i counted all of the little pieces okay then i counted how many 6s there was one 2 3 4
number all you have to do is count by 8s but how did you know that number because it s how many pieces we have because it s how many pieces in all whole she said the probability is 4 eighths is there another way for me to verbalize that 4 eighths what is that other way
half so about half of the time i will spin the spinner and it will land on a 6 percentages what percent of the time will my spinner land on a 6 what is the probability of my spinner landing on a 6 give me that in a percent what was that
one half 50% of this half of the time 50% of the time
away so we were working on problem solving and we re going to continue working on problem solving only today we re moving in a slightly different direction okay we re still working on problem solving but we re working on problem solving in the form of an investigation
okay so we re going to do a little math and science together sorry math and social studies but it s science also because you all just had the science fair so this should be an easy lesson for you
now just like in the science fair if you are designing an investigation what are some of the things you have to do in order to design an investigation okay no think about the science fair project
did make a hypothesis we want to make a hypothesis okay
okay for this math investigation we want to make a hypothesis doing
take a guess she says we take a guess what else do we do when we make a hypothesis okay science if then statement what else want to make a prediction okay
so when you re making a hypothesis you want to make a guess what do you think is going to happen what do you think the outcome is going to be prediction well i think or i predict that x or y is going to happen you can also put your hypothesis in the form of an if then statement
if i cross the street during traffic time then a car may possibly hit me statement so we want to make a hypothesis before we get started so we want to come up with a question okay what makes a good question
now remember we re doing an investigation so what types of things make a good question what do we want to think about when we re trying to develop a good question
what do we want to think about when we want to develop a good question d you guys just did your science fair project
question i don t want a question question what do you have to keep in mind when you re trying to come up with a good question do i want a question that everyone in the class may have also no okay
box what do you mean by that be creative you want to come up with something that s creative and good
questions think about your project and what category it goes into what else you can write down what deals with your project so we want to stay on topic and keep it focused
l look on the internet we could look on the internet for some ideas okay when we re thinking of a question we want a good question what if i chose the question how deep is the ocean floor what would be wrong with that question
it s not creative is that something i can test no so you want to keep in mind something that you can test something you can actually do so you want to think out of the box be creative stay focused but you want to come up with a question that s actually testable so after you do your hypothesis you come up with a question
your question is creative focused and is testable at that point what should i start doing at that point
do i m making some observations and i m making notes as i m making observations what am i doing at this point at this point i m collecting data
okay so now that i have come up with my question i know my hypothesis i m collecting data decide is the data that i m collecting categorical data or numerical data now if data fits under the category of categorical these are some examples names of town parks the type of pet a family has
okay numerical data goes along the lines of the number of times a family visits a town park or the number of people in a family so whenever you re dealing with numerical it involves numbers can somebody think of another example that would involve numbers something that you could test something that would involve numbers
a topic a graph okay graph what is something that involves numbers think about what you did temperature wonderful temperature involves numbers
category what is something that would go under categorical what temperature is it outside numbers what was that the type of thermometer wonderful that is something that would go under category
so what i want you to take about 2 minutes to do is i want you to think about a question that you could collect data on now this is going to be part of what you re going to have to do on your own at home so i want you to think of a focused creative question that you can collect data on and i also want you to think does your question go under categorical data or numerical data
minutes you can talk with the people at your table to come up with a good question book you can choose your question 1st then determine what category it goes into
it doesn t have to be anything hard difficult test how are you going to go home and test that
it because remember whatever your question is that s what you have to do when you get home today today okay keep in mind this is something you have to do when you get home
you don t have to write it up but you do have to write some data down when you ask people your question
i did a project on shoes and my project was how many pairs of shoes does a person own now there was a little more to mine but just to keep it basic for you that was a question i came up with
question numerical categorical not what kind how many pairs numerical now what if i said what types of shoes
that s categorical okay did you come up with a question what is your question how does the temperature change throughout the year
that if you all decided to go with the week what would be a quick way to determine how the temperature changed throughout the week go so you guys might want to take what is saying into consideration
now if you work with how it s changing throughout the week which category would your question fit into numerical data
to after we choose our question and decide which category and collect some data we then want to decide which graph would best fit our data
question now tell me what you can go home and do to collect some data for that question
home i don t so how are you going to test it throughout the whole winter because i want you to come back with some data tomorrow how about will the temperature go higher or lower not throughout the whole winter but as the day goes on from the morning to the night
is that something you can decide what would be a quick efficient way to decide something like that to collect some data on something like that
home how about in the newspaper does the newspaper have that in the back of it news on the computer cell phone does the weather man talk about the temperature in the afternoon the high and the low at night
yes they talk about that so instead of talking about the temperature throughout the whole winter maybe a whole week well you can do a week or you can do a day
day if you watch the news they ll give you the whole day
numerical temperature you guys come up with something what is it
okay think of something else look at the examples that you were given names of town parks
town that s a neighborhood park now she said park town is that something that you can think about and compile some data on could you take 10 people and ask them what type of pet a family has
pet what would your data be on that person it would be what 0 use those questions as examples okay could you take about 5 different students or 10 people in your class and ask them how many people in their family
yeah so you want to think in terms of something like that okay so i ll give you another minute to come up with a question
this is something you re going to collect data on today come up with a question yes
do ask them yeah you can collect the data by doing that now your data might be a little skewed or off because we don t know if she keeps track but if you want to choose that as your question no problem but at some point today you have to collect data on that question
what category would that question go under categorical or numerical numerical right how many together so most of the groups have a great question that s creative focused and most importantly testable
question how does the temperature change throughout the week okay class is that categorical or numerical numerical table 3 what s your question one more time okay class is that categorical or numerical numerical okay table one
that was table 2 what s your question table 2 how many tamales does ms numerical numerical table one are you ready question how many phone calls do you get in a week you need to choose a study group
you need to choose how many persons in your group and then what are you going to go and ask those persons that you choose to study them how many pies did you eat on thanksgiving what are you going to ask them table one is still out to lunch but you need to come up with a question because you need to go home and collect some data on it
so the end of this investigation is then taking your data and going back to graphs you already did graphs and deciding which graph would be the most appropriate graph for your data okay see all right
with me group 4 you re with me yourself make sure you push your chair in
on computer you are doing destination math do data analyst and probability start with the tutorial 3 different activities next those persons on computer
push your chairs in activity one
yes ma am in activity 2 you are with ms problems those with ms t you need your pencil
go your box is here mean median mode and range flip book 1st then you can choose one of the activities
that s it
you okay
solving so last week we were working on result unknown change unknown and start unknown okay so we re going to go back to that and review that concept to make sure you all got it and are ready to move on
okay so for that we were working on creating equations to represent those 3 different categories i have some simple problems for you and the 1st one says byron has 7 shells
then melissa gave him 9 more how many shells does byron have now 16 i m not looking for an answer
it let s do it together know byron has 7 shells have let s write this down as we go so i can keep track shells then melissa gave him 9 more shells gave him if someone gives you or adds to what you have what computation do i know i need to do
addition she gave him 9 more how many shells does byron have now now does the problem tell you how many shells he has now
you there we go because we don t know how many shells byron has now c 7 +9 equals c now is this particular equation result unknown and where do you find the result
end result unknown change unknown here is our change because 9 was added with it s result unknown all right so just move to what s in the bucket and we ll work on that towards the end
unknown now you guys go ahead we ll read number 2 together and then you have to identify it as result unknown change unknown start unknown and i need the equation to match if we do the equation 1st we should be able to determine the category
shells melissa gave byron some shells
now byron has 16 shells him find an equation for that problem
shells i m just going to go step by step with the problem shells melissa gave byron some shells so he s getting some additional shells
how many shells does melissa give byron some so what are we going to use for the variable c c now byron has 16 shells so it equals 16
is this result unknown change unknown or start unknown end do you have a result check change unknown did what we started with in the beginning change somehow
with what category does this question go under change unknown change unknown all right number 3 i need an equation and i need you to categorize the question result change or start unknown
shells melissa gives him 9 more shells how many shells did byron start with
with make sure you identify what type of a question it is
start unknown explain that to me using the question know because start with the top of the problem
unknown it says byron has some shells that is the start of the problem you don t know what it is okay so is saying she knows it s start unknown because byron has some shells
no it just says he has some shells agree good with that s a good question and it also gives you a clue a good clue
what in that helps you to further identify what type of a question it is start now if i asked you to take that problem we just did and to turn that problem into a break apart model what would that look like
what would that look like if you were to take that question take that equation and turn it into the break apart model
use your headphones please turn it down then
like let s see what you have
model all right so we have some number here and some number here in our break apart this number is broken into 2 parts so what is our whole or our largest number
16 and what is that 16 broken into parts 9 and something remember we want to stick with this model did did something a little different
model explain that to us why did you do that particular model 1st explain your model to us
what does that 16 at the bottom represent what it equals okay it represents the whole her 16 at the bottom represents the whole now i noticed that bar at the bottom is the same length as the top part that tell me what those 2 broken parts represent
the c represents the number we didn t know that he started with and the 9 is how much melissa gave him so why is your bar at the top the same length as your bar at the bottom
numbers we re going to come back to her because i want us to explore this a little more
know discuss it with each other
wonderful good job one good explanation okay
i have 3 different answers in front of me someone with result unknown change unknown and start unknown
discuss it
why is it start unknown what do you think
a result does this tell us the result what was leftover read where it gives us a result so do we have a result
it s definitely not result unknown because it gave us a result
change was it given or taken away read that sentence what was your result
what in that lets you know that that is your result what was leftover what are you missing okay
put it down can you explain your break apart model to us
so what can you tell us about those are the 2 numbers that make up 5
all right girls let s go back to number one byron has 7 shells then melissa gave him 9 more shells further what would the break apart model look like for number one
good what type of problem did we say number one was c because i don t know what my result is is what 2 numbers when put back together make up my unknown
7 and 9 so this break apart model says when i put 7 and 9 together i will get some number c some number let s go back to s model
okay this model is just another way to represent a problem not only does it represent a problem but you can use this model to solve a problem this is called a bar model or singapore math so i m going to give you a problem so we can use the bars in order to solve the problem
sarah had 15 eggs it s easter so they re colored eggs okay
they re cadbury chocolate eggs she divided now remember when we re working with problem solving you can be given problem solving with multiplication division addition subtraction
she divided those eggs equally
receive now if i were to ask you to use this model in order to represent this problem how could you do that on your board
okay so what is this problem asking us to do eggs she divided those eggs equally among herself and 2 friends how many eggs did each girl receive drawing your 1st step is to read the entire problem
that next it says rewrite the question in sentence form leaving a space for the answer that s when we write our equation equation so how can we turn this into a sentence form or into a equation
problem wonderful determine who or what is involved in this problem problem sarah and 2 friends wonderful what is involved in this problem
15 we have it right there we re dividing 15 between sarah and her 2 friends 3 equals c some number some unknown our next step is to draw unit bars we can chunk the problem and adjust the unit bars and fill in the question mark
our last step or 6th step is to correctly computate and solve the problem then to write the answer in the sentence and make sure the answer makes sense what would our drawing look like for this question if we were using the unit bars like did earlier okay so let s start with our whole what did we say our whole was
15 we need to divide this 15 equally buzzword equally into how many parts 3 sarah and 2 friends
here we go guys
is what does it have to have or what can t it have 3 or more sides we decided that a polygon has to have 3 or more sides
why why does a polygon have to have 3 or more sides
the shape would be open you need at least 3 sides in order to make a closed shape
we made that little analogy there we said polygons we had a nice little area here for our little mouse that s hanging out there he would have escaped the other ones or not be able to get across
what are some other criteria we have for our non polygons this one is closed
a it has to have straight sides
and these 2 have curves polygons have to have 3 or more straight sides and it needs to be a closed shape
the next day we read the green triangle and the triangle goes into our shape center he wasn t happy with his shape he started changing shapes all these different shapes
we started talking about what all these different types of polygons are called based on the number of what polygons by the number of what by the number of sides and that s what we re going to be working on today
you are going to be making polygons that have different numbers of sides
you re going to be making some triangles and some you re going to be making some pentagons that are 5s you re also going to try to make a 6 a 6 sided shape what s that called hexagon hexagon hex has an x
so we re going to try to make some polygons with 6 sides hexagons 7 is octagon 8 is like stop signs the most familiar one
listen a lot of you guys are does an octagon always have to look like a stop sign no
yes keep that in mind as you re creating your polygons that s 8 what about the ones that have 9 sides
what are they called remember 9s it s not fair to everyone else nonagons then 10 decagons now here s what you re going to do
you re going to be working with a partner you re going to get a bag of some shapes to work with here s what you re going to do
too you have to use at least 2 of these shapes no more than 3
for instance i ll show you
mean equal so the same length sides are going to line up easy i can put this together and make this shape this polygon let s just say i m going to make this shape
okay then your paper you re going to label the sides you want to know how many sides there are how many sides are there one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 what kind of polygon would this be
it s a polygon but it s also called what an octagon so i would want to put this shape in my octagon section
so what we re going to do is you re going to have 2 pieces of paper and several sections 8 different shapes we re going to take your paper and get it all set up
once you start creating your shape you re going to try to create with your baggy of polygons putting at least 2 together no more than 3 create at least one triangle one quadrilateral one pentagon one hexagon i want you to try to get at least one or 2 of the shapes in each of the boxes
that means you re going to have to take your polygons switch combinations right so that you don t have 10 triangles here and one you want to try to get one in each box at least
if you can get more than one in each box that would be awesome remember you re going to match up congruent sides what i mean is let s say you re working with a trapezoid here
okay you cannot match it up like this because this side is not congruent to this side yes i would have to turn it right to match up this way
don t try to spend all of your time trying to make one with the most sides work on your actual 3 through 10
do 1st thing we re going to do is set our papers up then i ll give you your baggy and let you get started each group is going to get 2 pieces of paper
just hold on a 2nd each person can fold one of them unfold it
11 of the partners okay those of you with your hands up get a pencil in your hand
when you guys were making your polygons which one did you think was the hardest to make
sides 7 decagons how many sides
3 of the small triangles to make a large triangle okay
also i think it was the quadrilateral some of you had a little trouble making a 4 sided shape other than some trapezoids was everyone able to make at least one shape in each box
yes i think for the most part after you were able to work with them for a while you were able to put one in each box
i saw several hexagons if you will take your papers pass them down
i will take those take one
all right this sheet should be super easy
name these polygons all right it says polygons have special names
13 21 you ve got to match the number a prefix to match the number what s the prefix for 3 tri
what s 4 quad
do number 24 as in 12
so yesterday we started a conversation about this question right here
c miss owned a she had 56 apples to arrange in rows for her window display she has room for 4 rows in her window how many apples will be in each row if she puts the same number in each row and we also talked about the important pieces of information so what are the important pieces of information from this problem
56 apples to arrange in 4 rows so 56 apples and they needed to be arranged in 4 rows and then what is the question that we needed to stay focused on f how many apples will be in each row if she puts the same number in each so we underlined that information yesterday
56 apples 4 rows that they needed to be arranged in and then how many apples will be in each row and we have to keep in mind that the same number had to be in each row about you had the option to use cubes the tiles and grid paper
v i used a little bit louder i just did it and how did you do it free i did half of each and half just talk a little bit louder
i did half of 56 equals 28 and then i did half of 28 equals 14 and that can you explain why that worked you had 28 a little bit louder
you half of 56 is 28 and then the other half is 28 and half of 28 is 14 and you get 2 out of 28 you get 2 14s out of 28 equals the other 2 but why are you cutting 56 in half and then cutting 28 in half so you are doing this to get 4 groups
so when you took the half of the 56 and you got 28 how many groups did you have 28s so here you had 2 groups of 28 and then you took those 2 groups split them in half split them in half again and so then you ended up with how many groups
14 can somebody else explain what she s talking about or at least get us started on another way to explain this idea r i used cubes to find out the equation of 56 divided by 4
1st why do you think was cutting 56 in half and then again in half so she got an answer of 28 and then she took that 28 and cut that in half again
why because if you divide 28 then you try and 4 groups keep thinking
a she cut i mean she but 2 28s and 4 rows she has to cut it down so there can be 4
i think she that because 28 +28 equals 56 and then 14 is half of 28 because if you cut it in half 14 take off half of the 28
notebook yeah can you come up and draw it on the overhead what you drew
don t so maybe factor isn t the right idea but maybe what you are thinking about
just think if you take the 14 and then you take the it s almost the as the like 4 times 2 equals 8
28 yeah i think i want to concentrate more on why she s breaking these numbers in half
so is that what your picture looked like
can i actually 56 said so he has 56 that s what i feel like i heard when you said that you cut the 56 in half and you show it in this picture but it s really that picture really shows the 14s
huh it equals that 28 each time for the 2 groups yes so here s the 56 and she said so 1st she cut it in half and she gets 28 how many groups does she have when it s cut in half and there s 28 in each group that right here
groups so if we transfer that idea to the question we re talking about rows does missus 4 so i m guessing that is now thinking okay well i can get a 4 out of there
all i need to do is cut those groups in half again and luckily these numbers work pretty nicely when we re cutting them in half share so when she cut it in half now in each group there are 14 do you see the picture that matches what she s talking about cutting these ideas cutting these numbers in half
multiple students yes so she 1st cut the 56 in half and the 56 gets cut in half and it was 28 and 28 then she took it and she cut it again in half and it got to be 14 for the 4 groups so she knew her final answer had to be 14 because that means there would be 14 in each row
up now a lot of you built this with tiles a lot of you built this with tiles and you just had an array and you had 4 rows with 14 in each and i m not going to do the entire thing but this is how you got started right
yes if you use the tiles or you use the cubes how did you know how to start arranging them on your desk how did you know how to start arranging them on your desk
you could put 56 and 510s and then 61s and then the fact that 56 was 28 and half of 28 was 14
tiles anybody else have an explanation as to how you arranged your tiles how you knew to do the 4 rows on your desk miss r i noticed something what did you notice that 4 s a factor of 28 i mean 4 is a factor of 28 and is a factor of 14
so if you 28 to 14 it gives you the answer it is 4 a factor of 14 no we talked about that with a few minutes ago but 4 is part of that 28 and that s one of the reasons why we re able to this up here and then so any other thoughts as to how you arranged your tiles on your desk
i kept the in so you took out all 56
and was groups i got my answer when you had the 56 did you put them into 4 groups one at a time 1111
that one group of 14 and then a group of so when you were passing out the tiles did you say one tile to the 1st row another tile to the 2nd row one more tile to the 3rd row to the 4th row
a we could break them down to 2 groups you could start off at 12 and then each row could put 12 and then if that does not work just add on
row yes and so that actually would be 12 times 4 right there so that s a little bit different than just passing out one at a time and that s actually something that i want you to focus on today
whether you are using manipulatives or you are drawing a picture or you are just writing down equations i want you to try to think about these ideas by passing them out in groups so instead of passing out one to each group at a time think about how you can pass out a larger amount so is saying that he could have given 12 to each row
so that would be the 4 groups of 12 and then we have all the extras that get us up to 56 that we can pass out by ones or maybe if you have enough and you can tell that you have enough you can pass them out by 2
f i put all the pieces and then i put them in rows i put 11 in each row and then i had left and then i put other ones and got 13
so that s even another idea so instead of doing the 12 in each row you could also do 11 in each row which would be your 11 times 4 and then add on the additional ones from there so same idea as but just a different amount that you are doing a bigger chunk this reminds me of when you are doing the bigger array small array you are trying to make smaller arrays that can help you solve the larger problem
so you need to keep all of these things in mind today when you are working on this is how are you going to represent that answer and how are you going to figure out what the final answer is ones are you just looking at the tiles are you just looking at your cubes
saying yes my last question before we get started with today s activity some of you yesterday started doing this 56 times 4 equals blank
a couple of you caught yourself and said 0 that wasn t what the problem was asking a couple of you i asked you a few questions and then you were able to say no that s not what we re doing why isn t this problem 56 times 4 store she has 56 apples to arrange in rows and she wants 4 rows
how come the problem does not work for 56 times 4 so how come 56 times 4 is not what we wanted to do because you are trying to 56 in 4 rows you are trying to get to 56 in 4 rows
v it s going to equal a much bigger number and those of you that i spoke to yesterday you had a very large number and my 1st question to you is it possible to have that many in each row if all you have is 56 you had a number in the 200s didn t you multiple students yes
and so if we have a number in the 200s is that going to work if all together we only have 56 apples yes you can t use time tables you can t use a time table so that became division so how do we write division 56 divided by 4 equals 14
so it s not this but we can write 56 divided by 4 equals our answer of 14 problems you can take a seat right next to if that works or you can take a seat right next to yes i did it solving different way i knew 28 +28 equals 56 and 14 +14 equals 28
28 you take away get rid of the 14 and so maybe that was a similar thinking that we had here with yes can you take a number line how would you do it with a number line
so maybe try it today and see if what the problems today if it would work on the number line and maybe jumping in a certain number of groups because last year in 3rd grade you did multiplication with jumping on a number line
too so what i need you to do is take out your math books out unit 3 unit 3 yes
17 as soon as you get those pages out you can get started
you have the choice of using equations pictures manipulative they re on the counter graph a grid paper your choice
remember to think about how can you do this in bigger groups instead of just passing out one at a time

3 groups

multiple students 3 groups group so i m hearing both
problem is it okay if we have 3 groups
here what is the equation that we will use to solve this problem without the answer
s 48 divided by 3 do we agree on that please do we agree it s 48 divided by 3 equals blank
problem i need and i need eyes up here problem can i have hands off cubes and tiles so that we can hear what everyone s saying
times 3 equals that s an excellent start
start what does 3 times 10 equal 30 tell us
r it s a good start because the 3 from the 48 divided by 3 you put it in times 10 and you end up where the 10 is you will get your answer what do you mean where the 10 is we re going to get our answer if you keep adding them up to 48 then your answer where are we going to have the 48
is the 48 going to be where the 30 is or is it going to be here is so i think what means by the answer is that our final answer is going to to be here somewhere so can someone add onto what started with us
30 i m not seeing that many hands for multiple students what does 3 groups stand for r students in a group yep the 3 students in the group what does this 10 stand for
and what does the 30 stand for the equation but what is the 30 telling us asked what is the 30 representing 3 times 10 equals 30
10 well it s a multiple of 10 yeah 10 what does 30 represent students so this 1st equation that gave us is telling us 30 students so far so here s our 3 students in each group
groups so there are those students in that number of groups and we have 30 students taken care of no how many more students do we have to figure out where they go 18 how many more students are we still dealing with more how do you know it s 18 more i can t hear you
sorry so you are taking the 30 students out of this 48 students going off of what started us with 3 times 10 how do we get to 18 now we know that there needs to be 3 students in a group
18 think about your facts left we know that there has to be 3 students in a group
a 6 so how do we write that following s model write time 6 equals mentioned something about our answer being there where is our answer i need your eyes up here
answer if you add the if we add the 38s where are the 38s where it says 3 is 3 times i don t see counting by 3s 8 times up here i see 3 times 10 equals 30 and i see 3 times 6 equals 18
where do we find our answer i know we ve been working on this for a while boys and girls but i need your eyes up here answer said it will be there i m calling on the same kids because we don t have 100% participation here
where is our answer the 18 48 is that the answer to our problem no so your question again is how many groups will there be
no yes no what s the 48 representing relax what does the 48 represent problem students this is the students students where s our answer
need eyes up here 18 so that was our 48 students answer no
so our problem is 48 divided by 3 equals blank students did a nice job starting us off with a 3 by 10 students then we had 3 times 6 to get us 18 more students can you tell us where the answer is middle in the middle how do we know that that is our answer
cause why does not the 3 change
represent cause should be shh the by the what s the 3 students 3 students . in each group
yes 3 students in each group and i like that you said that 3 did not change so yeah that s representing the students in the groups answer how many groups are we going to need 16 groups we re going to need 16 groups here
so we could have written 3 times 16 is equal to 48s 30 +14 here you mean that it s a completely different strategy that you use
paper cause we don t have enough time to go over another way to do it right now what 48 divided by 3 equals what
you said divided 48 divided by 3 48 divided by 3 16 so the number of groups we need is 16
so our big array would have been a 3 by 16 right yes so there would have been 3 cubes in every single group because there were 3 kids in each group but made a nice big jump
she said let s start off with a 3 by 10 and then that leaves us with just a 3 by 6 so even though we re moving into division that big array small array idea is coming back and it s going to help you solve these division problems so we can write this as 48 divided by 3 is equal to 16 groups of students we can also say that 3 times 16 is equal to what 48
plus what +3 times 10 and 3 times 6 and that s not the only way that it could have broken down it i like that we started with the 3 times 10 because you all know your 10s
10s those are facts that you can say pretty fast and a few of you when i met with you we talked about that and i think it was for numbers 3 i think that s when i was talking to you about when you broke it down into a multiple of 101st and actually you too for number 3 you also broke it down into the 10s so that s a fact to go to so you don t have to be counting by 3s every single time
up you could have taken 3 cubes and just have kept going until you got to your 48 but i want you to start taking larger jumps last year 3rd grade you counted by 3s until you got to whatever you needed to to you can move beyond that taking a huge jump 30 so that s 10 of these right away that you don t need to have in front of you
any questions you have about number one any questions can you do about way could ve you have them plus like repeated addition
yeah like doing the same number and adding it up again and again and again and again well you could have the of 10 and then add the 8 so if we re thinking about addition if you are thinking about adding 10s and then an 8 you have to connect that back to the problem
is that going to help us get 3 groups or 3 students in our group if we re adding 10s so cause one group would be 3 students another group would be 3 that go back to the problem and see if it makes sense with the problem are we okay with this yes so this idea is going to connect to what we re doing tomorrow
i know you all did not finish all 4 problems and that s fine tomorrow we re going to continue and we re going to talk about what happens when we have leftovers so we re solving a problem like this but then we have some leftovers sorry what s going to happen when we do have leftovers we need to clean up get all of our cubes and everything back into place
okay good morning guys how are you good today we re going to work on our skill today is going to be multiplying decimals with whole numbers and with decimals do we practiced adding decimals subtracting but today it s going to be multiplying
before multiplying decimals by decimals let me see your hands decimals very few so the 1st thing you re going to do hopefully is you have a piece of graph paper and we re going to make 10 by 10 boxes
more you need 6 10 by 10 boxes and i m going to give you a minute right i need 3 10 by 10s on one side and flip it over
10s i m going to give you about 3 minutes to do that while i put something on the board okay making 10 by 10
go ahead and get out your if you re done make sure you have your crayons and colored pencils started how are we doing over here do you want us to connect them no separate them like she did ruler did i get some started for you
there do at least 2 more and get started we re going to get a blue colored pencil or a blue pen and a yellow colored pencil or a yellow pen find those and what we re going to do 1st is we re going to make a model of this multiplication problem
does anybody have any idea how to do that make a model
n color in 2 boxes and one of them okay we re going to use 2 boxes how are we going to color them we re multiplying 2 times what is this number guys
53 hundredths i want to make a model statement then you have 53 of each one of those in the box you re telling me i m going to have 53 hundredths how many am i going to color 53 hundredths how many times 2
say loud i was going to say the same thing so you re on the right track thinking right we want to take 53 hundredths and multiply it twice but we have to make a model of that carefully take your blue crayon or pencil
start at the very left column and color how many hundredths guys 53 hundredths how many tenths is that everybody 5
5 it s 5 tenths that s 5 straight down that makes it easy to color and then how many hundredths 33 more little ones
go ahead and do that and color them all together you know what i mean so 5 tenths one 2 3 4 5 and then 3 more understand put your hand up
5 then 3 little ones do you understand can you make sure she s doing it correctly do you guys get it it look here s his 5 tenths which is 5 columns and he has to color how many little ones now 3 so put them right next to it
top you re going to keep doing it with blue correctly it makes 53 hundredths all right that s 153 hundredths but we re multiplying it by what
2 so we need to do another 53 hundredths give me 3 more ones this time we re going to pick yellow you re going to take your yellow you have 53 what s this right here yellow you can t erase it
now make another 53 hundredths you re going to color 53 more left 7 and then you re going to go how many more columns how many more columns do you have left
if i color 7 down i m going to do s how many squares do you have left in this block how many squares do i have left in this block if i colored 53 and have it up to 100 i have 47 so if i color all of those you re going to color all of what s left yellow
that color all the blocks left yellow yellow that s 47 but how many do we need need 6 them go to another box and color how many 6 what color yellow okay
let me go over that again the 2nd group of 53 we re making what color everybody yellow so we have 47 to color in one block left we need to go to another block and make how many 6 more is that 53
53s we have blue and yellow now if we added up all these blocks we would get our answer so go ahead and see how many blocks you get
count the numbers shaded in hundredths count the number you have colored when you re done coloring block somebody tell me how many total you have block okay if we add them up how many do we get
one and 6 hundredths very good 106 he colored 1061s right 106 hundredths and now it s really how many total blocks do you have fully colored
leftover 6 hundredths so it s 106 hundredths you colored or your colored a whole block and what 6 hundredths who sees how to make the model
model we colored 53 hundredths 2 times and counted all the hundredths let her in quietly more this time flip over your paper to the back
you should have 3 on the back 3 boxes you re drawing on the back along this time we re going to multiply and i m going to see if you guys can do it we re going to multiply 3 times what how do we day it 6 tenths is 6 tenths a whole no so what are we going to do to get started
3 times 6 tenths what are we going to do we re going to color 6 tenths how many times 3 you guys i wonder if we re going to be able to do it in one block start with blue again and color 6 tenths how many columns is that 6 so everybody color
one go to the back page take one block and color 6 tenths blue okay that s how many columns 6 how many hundredths is that
right the 1st block we re going to color blue 6 tenths blue
down do columns and start from the far left and make sure you do what your neighbor s doing we re modeling 3 times 6 tenths here s a 10 right right you need 6 of them do it up and down
right see you guys see that up we re in a new square okay
one we need to color another 6 tenths so how many do we have left in this block tenths so then you have to go to another block and color how many 2 more color 4 more what s in this block
is going to go along with us and see what we re doing then you re going to go to the next block and color 2 more tenths finish this in yellow because we re making 6 more tenths then you re going to need another hundredths box
nice how many do we color in the 2nd box guys 2 tenths you only had 4 yellow and you need 6 group there s 4 and you need 2 more
yellow okay that s 2 groups of 6 tenths how many do we need though 3 so let s pick green to color our last group of 6 tenths so color 6 green
a she had 2 left here and now she s going to do 6 green in that box right you need 2 more down here because that s 4 tenths and 2 is 6
you need to make another 10th box quickly okay you need 6 green so 2 sixths how many columns should we have leftover that aren t colored i hear 2
i hear 82 tenths should not be colored because 2 tenths are yellow and then we re making 6 which is green so 2 tenths +6 tenths is how many tenths 8 there s 2 left not shaded 2 tenths
problem if we have 3 groups of 6 tenths what s our answer going to be okay how many very good i will take that s an answer definitely how many total tenths do we have
18 is that right blue 6 12 yellow then 6 more is what 18 tenths right
way don t we have a whole block guys colored then how many other tenths colored make me believe it whole then how many in the other block are colored 8 columns which is 8 tenths
3 times 6 tenths is a whole and 8 tenths who understands that model i m going to let you get caught up i m giving you 30 seconds to get caught up those that are still coloring can you put the problem 3 times 0.6
this represents 3 times 0.6 equals one.8 and on the other side write what the model represented 2 times 0.53 okay yes
when you multiply a decimal by a whole number if you look at it without the decimal i m going to show you that in a minute 1st we re making a model then i m going to show you right each problem did you put what it represented
the model that shows 2.53 write the answer did you do that okay the 1st one we did yeah yes
all right now find do you guys have one block leftover that has nothing in it
2 good so pick one that has no colors in it and now we re going to make a model of a decimal times a decimal so for example we re going to do 0.3 times 0.7 model anybody have an idea how we might do that
a i m going to color 3 columns 3 tenths take another color and draw 7 tenths okay
is do you know how to find what my answer is yes if i count it all you re so close n you know what your answer is by the end of the model to see how many blocks there is
i know what my answer is by what by at the end how the model is shown and how many are leftover last try you re supposed to color in 3 columns 7 times you re supposed to you re thinking i m supposed to color 3 columns 7 times
0.7 i m doing 0.3 times 0.7 answer not columns watch what we do square tell you what let s use blue okay
i want you to color okay 3 here you re going to color what does this mean 3 tenths you ve got to listen carefully
do blue let me do it 1st 3 tenths from the bottom all the way across you see how i did that i m going across right that i m going horizontal you see
horizontal 3 tenths 3 columns going across 0.3 you can even write that if you want at the bottom 0.3
okay now we re going to take yellow and how many do we have to color yet i want to make sure we do it right everybody done doing 3 across yellow i think we re going to take yellow i m going to do it on s so you can all see i m going to do 7 going down
your yellow is no good how about yours 7 one 2 3 4 5 6 7 i m going to color 7 going up and down you re even going to have to go on top of the blue
can make sure you color the blue too what are you doing this is supposed to be blue on the bottom 7 you re going to go over this blue too all the way up and down
you have to go over the blue color what color does it make it makes green when you go over the blue right kind of it you re going to have to borrow her sharpener or something
is doing it correctly it s got to overlap color we colored 7 yellow 7 tenths how many blue did we make 3 tenths from the bottom
do you see where you have some overlapping green do you guys see where you make green there count how many hundredths hold on
you can say it but count how many hundredths are green say it guess you re right the overlapping section is your answer to the decimal problem
e 2121 what tenths it s 21 hundredths how would i write 21 hundredths everybody 0.21
so we have 3 tenths 3 rows on the bottom right yellow and how many tenths i m sorry 7 where they overlap they have a green color
the green is your answer and if you count all these boxes that s your answer to a decimal times a decimal 21 hundredths do we have one more box that s free box let s do this one this time let s do different colors blue and red
it we re going to do 0.2 red times 0.8 blue
i want to know what my answer would be decimal times decimal 0.2 horizontal that means across the bottom is doing it right so i ll hold it up make purple look did it right
she did 2 tenths red horizontal see that blue 8 how many columns do you have to color 8 tenths you using blue right
okay 8 tenths blue that has to go up and down and you re going to go over the red when you color
red you understand make sure you color over the red
okay i m trying to set something up here
okay now what s our answer where they overlap is our answer where we get purple have 16 hundredths how do we write 16 hundredths 0.16
so 2 tenths times 8 tenths is 16 hundredths 0.16 make sure you put the number sentence by the model guys now i m going to show you another way if you don t show a model
now i m going to show you another way okay now the 1st way to show you a model is you know how we like to be able to show pictures
it that s right
bingo a lot of you probably already know this i m trying to show you a song
can you put it on song 2 on have a seat how do you get the sound out
i have the volume at 2 watch guys i m going to start it over
multiplying decimals is very similar to multiplying whole numbers okay here we have one.34 multiplied by 9.8 other one.34 being multiplied by 9.8 multiply the one thing you have to remember to do and i wrote this in green is you have to multiply as if the decimals are not even there
so let s just imagine that these decimal points don t even exist and multiply 3 8 times 3 is 24 +3 is 27 32 and we have 8 times one which is 8 +2 is 10
moving on to the 2nd line we place our 0 and have 9 times 4 which is 36 3 9 times 3 which is 27 +3 is 30 3 9 times one is 9 +3 is 12 add just like a normal multiplication problem we add them all together
one one +0 +0 is one one +2 is 3 and one plus nothing is just one my final answer but we have to go back to the original problem and find our decimals what we need to do is look how many numbers are to the right of our decimal how many
in our 1st number one.34 we have 2 numbers to the right of our decimal and in 9.8 we have one number to the right of our decimal which gives us a total of 3 numbers with a decimal so since our original problem has 3 numbers to the right of the decimal our final answer has to have 3 numbers to the right of the decimal we count our 1st 3 numbers
where is the decimal going to go i place my decimal and notice how we have 3 numbers in our final answer to the right of our decimal so one.34 and 9.8 is 13.132
so here are some more example problems related to the video you just watched i hope you found this helpful we re going to watch that another time
that let s just go through a quick example and then break up into groups so if we re not going to make a model you can do it the easy way and multiply somebody give me a multiplication problem with decimals
number i was thinking 5 how do we say that everybody 5 and 32 hundredths multiplied by 3 tenths you want to do 3 tenths 0.3 no let me ask again when i multiply decimals do i have to line them up
no okay we re going to pretend the decimals aren t even here to start with like he said and what are we going to do normally so 2 times 3 is 6 3 times 3 9 3 times 5 15 right how many places from here to here with the decimal 32
i always start here and go one 22 places from the whole number right here i m going to pretend it s a whole number here and then move it go one now you add that 2 +one is 3 remember i have to pretend my decimal is here
places 3 one 2 3 what s my answer say it one.596 who understands how is it different from adding and subtracting decimals it s my cold medicine
how is it different from adding and subtracting decimals when i multiply subtracting and adding decimals you have to line them up up because it s like if you put the 3 all the way over where the 5 is it would be like would it still be like it would be kind of hard to multiply if you did that
wouldn t it be kind of confusing yes i would keep it here and treat it like a normal multiplication problem 1st without the decimals if you lined up the decimals couldn t you put the 0 after the value digit if i lined them up and put this here
answer you re telling me to put 5.32 times let s see up yes you re lining them up by putting a 0 after
3 tenths is really 30 hundredths right right you think we re going to get the same answer okay here wait a minute 2 how many did they move here
no is one.5960 equivalent to that it s the same answer it is the same answer it works but it s not an even step worked just count the decimals
today 1st we multiplied whole numbers by a decimal and made a model model then i showed you if i don t need you to make a model you can just do it by regular multiplying and then making a decimal okay groups you all are going to do something different
the 1st group you re going to go to the base 10 blocks you need to take your journal with you and you re going to use the base 10 blocks and follow my paper you re going to have to make these decimal models 2 ways
i need to move to the back table with your journal and pencil you re going to work at the back table you need to go to a new place in the journal
you re making the decimal 2 ways with the base 10 blocks the next group this group is going to come to me so stay where you are and
okay you guys all come here for a minute and i want the teacher group sitting here i want you all sitting here
are you guys get out your math book and open to page 133 and i ll be with you in a minute you can stay here you guys have a seat
you you re over there when i get to one move to your groups you you re back there on the floor are you with
seat all right the back table i ll be with you in a minute follow my sheet and see if you can figure out what to do this open up your math books to 133 and i ll be with you in a minute
put your name on this you get one put your name on this all right did you get one name on the paper you guys are going to start page 127 in your notebook 127
133 all right you guys ready you guys are doing this let me remind you if you re in a group you re working quietly
you guys are going shopping you re going to have to use this chart on the back okay you 1st you have 2 stores
back you have the cherokee store and the canton store you re going to have to figure out how much 8 folders cost at the cherokee store
you guys figure out right now where are the folders from the cherokees they re ¢15 each
how much would they cost at canton ¢11 each or buy 3 get one free now what i want you guys to figure out is how much 8 folders costs at cherokee and how much 8 folders cost at canton and put it in your chart
what are you going to do you have an idea ¢15 which is one.5 times 8
all right then what are we going to do for canton we need 8 you guys think on that for a minute
you need 8 right if you buy 3 how much is 3 0.11 times 3 is 33 right ¢33 then you get one free so you now have how many
4 then you get 3 more 0.11 times 3 which is 33 so you really had to buy how many to get 2 free 6 so figure out the chart on that figure out the price of one tablet from each store on those charts
what s wrong how
you have to go the opposite way you all have to get the same answer all right okay
which one are you on let me help you with one
you need 4 packs how many come in a pack wait let s do cherokee where is a regular pack 0 okay
¢93 doubled is what
go ahead and multiply that what did you guys get
$5.58 let s see what it is one.86 times 3 what s 6 times 3 18 3 times one is 3
so it s going to move 2 so we start here did you guys get $5.58
we need how many
stay where you are
up what did we try to learn how to do today f multiply decimals we used models to do a whole number times a decimal then a decimal times a decimal and then we did it without models
you guys have been practicing real life math going to a store and trying to figure out which is cheaper by multiplying right up take your work back to your unfinished red folder
all right you guys 1st thing i want to do today is i want to make a list of the formulas that we have learned so far because yesterday you learned a new formula so we are going to add we are going to make a list that we can keep in here that you can refer to okay
me when i talked to her last night on the phone she said that some of you were having a little bit of problems with the area of a parallelogram so we are going to talk about that today cause it is actually the parallelogram should be just as simple as a rectangle and a square what i think confuses you is the verbiage the words that we use
confusing so formula for the area of a square do that s good though you did a good job know 0 that is a hard one
job okay remember all the sides in a square are even right side we also might see it described as how else side length times width length times width base times height or base times height good
for okay rectangle how might we see that formula described length times width length times width base times height okay or also base times height good
side all right what about a triangle base times height one half one half base times height or length times width with a triangle you really want to stick with the base and the height okay and remember that sometimes the height is showed with a dotted line right
parallelogram okay teacher yeah congratulations job so proud of you fun yes it was the winning word was the winning word last year what was it 0 what word potpourri well good job
you a cookie and a trophy carry the trophy around with you you okay what is the formula for a parallelogram area of a parallelogram height so it is the same thing
okay and the height of the parallelogram just like with a triangle is showed with what a dotted line a dotted line
off computer know okay 22.6 okay i think also well correct me if i am wrong
is one of the things that was hard for you counting the little squares with the halves again good all right get all of our technology going maybe you have got to be kidding me i wonder if because i unplugged this that i am going to have to restart the computer
what are you looking for i am trying to get the document camera to come on but i think because did you see i unplugged it to move to accommodate this that now we are going to have to restart the computer okay so what i will do is i ll restart the computer i ll restart the computer but i ll call the numbers out on this but i will need the document camera to show you how to use the manipulatives in what we are doing today
on okay all right if you do not have it right just correct it so for numbers 10 sorry and 2 you were supposed to write down the base and height of each figure
so in number one the base is 3 because there are 3 little squares and i ll show in the document camera in just a 2nd at the bottom
okay and then the height is 8 so 3 on the bottom 8 up 123 okay
fine 123 and then the height is going to be the highest part so 12345678 okay did anybody not get 38 i got 3 there do you see how it is 3 there 123 ow is that 3 it is not shaded out all the way look let me see your pen here is 123 because it is almost all the way shaded in
teacher i got 3 on the other side because she said on the other side if you put that one over here it makes a whole it is close enough you got 3 yeah good okay okay i put 3 times 8 not just 8 okay all right and then for number 2 the base is 6 and the height is 11
11 okay all right number 3 find the area of each parallelogram what did you put for number 39 square inches not 91818 because you do the base which is 3 times the height which is 6
3 times 6 is 18 and it is square inches because it is area
a so you can always just look back up here at the formulas and remember base times height yeah okay do number 430 centimeters squared good 30 centimeters squared and what is the equation you used for that one i did 7 and 5 tenths times 4 good
okay any questions about that one you guys good yeah what was the answer again 30 square centimeters we were on number 4 okay so number 5 we had to find the missing measurement
so in number 5 what did you put for the area of that parallelogram a 112.5 a 112.5 centimeters centimeters squared squared good a 112 and 5 tenths or a 112.5 square centimeters centimeters squared good job
s wait what was the answer to number 5 a 112.58 and 2 tenths yards awesome not yards squared just yards that i multiplied 12 into 98.4
no i did i know where you didn t do 12 times 98 and 4 tenths i said i divided 12 into 98 and 12 times 8 equals 96 and then i knew that i had a decimal and then i put 2 and i figured out that would work good because 24 cause 2 was the remaining because 96 -98
0 that was good okay good 8 and 2 tenths yard the biggest thing to remember with that is that division is the opposite of what
multiplication so if to find area we multiply base times height to find either the base or the height we are going to divide okay are we good yeah all right number 7 what is the height in number 7 huh 12 miles 12 miles good 12 miles
down weren t you supposed yeah we are going to get there in a 2nd thumbs up medium thumbs down okay mostly thumbs up review what is the area of a triangle with the base of 5 inches and a height of 6.5 inches
that not 32.5 be 5 times 6.5 half length times width one half what is the base
doing the 2 times 0 calm down okay okay what did you so did you divide it or you forgot to divide you forgot to divide
and that is how remember when we talked about triangles that is the number one thing i said people forget to do ahead so number 9 what is the area of a square with sides that are 23 centimeters long i multiplied 23 by 23 and got 529 give me the units 529 what
centimeters centimeters what squared squared okay so number 529 square centimeters all right good number 10 write a number between and one and 3 hundredths and 110th or 10 hundredths what did you put one and 8 hundredths one and 8 hundredths what is another one
one and 7 hundredths good one and 9 hundredths one and 9 hundredths good
j 308469 teacher 308469 very very good okay
here all right we are going to do an activity today comparing the area of a triangle with the area of a parallelogram without using any formulas okay
so we know that the area of a parallelogram is base times height and squares rectangles and parallelograms can all be divided in half to form congruent triangles
minute so for example okay how many of you have ever had your mom make you a sandwich okay all right and so those triangles generally are congruent
day that is why the formula is half the base times height right half you have a triangle half base times height now my boys they want them like the little uncrustables where there is like the little round thing i have a little round thing that you can mash the sandwich down and it seals the edges
yeah high maintenance okay all right so how could we compare the area of a triangle with the area of a parallelogram without using any formulas think how could you compare the area of a parallelogram with the area of a triangle okay well let us see
problem and you have to be patient with me because the orientation of this is different and i am trying to figure it out 0 my goodness samira has made a triangle on the geoboard
that no i can not i can but not that well i see light it is too bright working on it
0 my goodness this is making me crazy okay samira has made a triangle on a geoboard joe says she can find the area of the triangle by changing it into a parallelogram
problem so i am going to pass out some geoboards to you guys and some rubber bands and we are going to actually do this one a little bit differently instead of having you guys work in groups on it we are going to kind of work on it and go together scoot your chair back here with please you just need a pencil
all right you 3 are going to work together actually you 2 work together take that over with please sorry pull your chair up here with and m
can you take those off so that you only have 2 okay a and a are going to work together break no you do not need it right now
them bring your chair up here it okay my s are going to work together all right and r you are going to work together okay
c sorry about that thank you though there is 2 rubber bands the extras 2 which pegs are missing
group when you get this put your group members names on them the names of the group members on the paper please okay yes are you upset about something no
today he was energetic because the movie 0 is that what it is okay promise promise promise you better promise all right now notice yes
okay notice that on the geoboard have you all ever noticed that the geoboards are labeled points yes okay
so it is going to go i am so sorry you all this like moving this stuff has completely messed up my orientation so you are going to make a triangle at .123 and then over 22 sit up look at your board okay all right take yeah
if we have 2 what do we do with the other one the other rubber band okay now take your 2nd rubber band right over the 1st rubber band so you have 2 rubber bands right on top of each other okay
okay now what i want you to do is to create a parallelogram you are going to move your rubber bands and you are going to create a parallelogram 0 i think i know how to with try to figure out how you move without taking it all the way off the board
okay without taking it all the way off the board stretch it to make a parallelogram did 0 no that is a rectangle sorry but you are close
do turn it into a parallelogram not a square yeah we can not make a square
is this a parallelogram what about this no no yep is this it
nope really 0 maybe
see it kind of looks like a diamond her is this it
on 033 nope that is not a parallelogram that is a rectangle
how did it start out again keep trying i do not get this teacher come on keep trying we are trying to make a parallelogram e got it
we thought we got it side remember a parallelogram has the 2 slanted sides
that is not a parallelogram yes that is a parallelogram i am confused what happened to your original triangle i am just kind of trying out something no one like we can not have some on one and some on the others
no you can have some edges we just have one thing on why it no take turns wait let me try hold on
okay where is your other rubber band though i am trying to get you to make the remember our problem is finding the area of a parallelogram from the triangle got one yeah but where is your other rubber band 0 remember our problem is to find the area of put your feet down
up our problem is find the area of a parallelogram from our original triangle so you want to still be able to see your original triangle it is but that is the same exact thing that i did that she did
you kind of lose the original triangle what we are trying to do is hold on 12nd i am not real impressed with your effort today
you does this count okay but put your original triangle back okay let me kind of give you a hint it is not a parallelogram that a diamond what we are trying to do is we are trying to see how a parallelogram okay that s not a triangle
right okay listen for just a 2nd what are you doing okay now it says okay so now what we want to do is we want to stretch the rubber band to create a 4th corner
okay at 12 this is not working i am just going to be real honest with you picture we ll look at the little boy who is doing it right because we are obviously not
boy now part of the reason that this is a problem is our geo let us see if we can figure this out though our geoboards aren t labeled like their geoboard is okay because their geoboard says use the .0010 and 22
see what if we make our triangle with .1121 and 33 so if that makes a triangle
okay so we would be 1121 and hold on 22 my rubber band is too small
do not you mean 33 okay 33 thank you yes 33 okay so now look now my triangle looks like this hold on
look okay guys see here is .11 here is .21 and here is .33 okay let us see if we can get somewhere with this now let us put our 2nd rubber band on top of it
it 0 we did that out okay now direction number 2
we are going to create a rubber band by stretching okay we are going to stretch one
we are going to make a 4th corner by stretching to 23 there that was easy is see
because this is .23.23 awesome awesome now here is what okay so here is what i am trying to show you
we are trying to compare the triangle with the parallelogram so i want a statement where you are comparing the triangle and the parallelogram give me a statement about the relationship between the triangle and the parallelogram okay well i may have misunderstood it because a lot of the people who got the parallelogram shape you lost the original triangle
and i wanted you to see the original triangles because this is where we are making the connection about the relationship between triangles and parallelograms something what do you see triangle always like the area is half the parallelogram okay what did he just say
n half of a parallelogram is a triangle okay a triangle is half of a parallelogram see how this parallelogram has 2 triangles that what other shape has 2 triangles a square a square a square what is the formula for area of a square
or base times height base times height what is the formula for area of a parallelogram base times height and here is the connection that we were trying to make okay is that just like a square is made up of 2 triangles so is a parallelogram a parallelogram is made up of 2 triangles as well
and that is why formula for a square formula for a parallelogram are the same
and this is why i think that it gets confused because if we consistently use the language base times height base times height base times height you would remember that better are there any other shapes that have the formula base times height that also are made up of 2 triangles rectangles okay says rectangle agree 0 i know an octagon prove it
prove on your geoboard that a rectangle is made of 2 triangles and when you have some proof prove on your geoboard that a rectangle is made up of 2 triangles
good another on top of this and then you just make a half teacher teacher hold on job awesome where is your i am looking for your rectangle okay good job
you said we are supposed to make a rectangle or a rectangle huh good job okay now look okay so let us look up here rectangle i am going to do a rectangle that is 4 by 2 okay
so i have a rectangle that is 4 by 2 and now to make my triangles geoboard you are not my friend
carefully 0 it is snowing 0 okay it is just little little yeah flurries but that is pretty me i am almost done
okay i need a helper brain is going to help me with his brain this triangle but i need everybody is eyes because could be wrong so this triangle right here what is the base of this triangle
base what is the base 2 it is 2 height 4 down okay now this triangle see where i am pointing
this triangle what is the base of this triangle 0 my gosh the base of of this triangle 22 see how the base is up on top yes okay what is the height of this triangle 4 so somebody describe the relationship between those 2 triangles j they are the same okay give me a better math word than same
congruent congruent equivalent equivalent the same okay now huh equal good now i want another word though this is not really necessarily a math word but this describes the way that they are positioned
board congruent symmetrical we already said congruent ooh symmetrical that is a good word e geometry upside down what congruent we already said congruent word the same we said same
i said that okay they are inverted meaning one is facing this way the other is facing this way right doesn t inverted basically mean upside down yeah we have one look pay attention if the pencil point for this one is up the pencil point for this one is down inverted the base is here on the bottom for this triangle
triangle but this is also like if you unfold the shapes it would be like basically remember last year in 4th grade when you did flip you did rotation you did turns
relationship triangle can make a square okay now i know starting out with this geoboard was a little tricky it took us a few minutes to kind of get it going but the point of looking at like this and not at the snow looking at me the point of looking at it like this is because i want you to see this is how you are going to understand these formulas
squares rectangles parallelograms are all made up of 2 triangles that s why the relationship is always base times height for all 3 of them they are made up of 2 triangles which is why the area of a triangle is one half base times height see now what you are doing is you are understanding you are not just memorizing formulas
you are understanding why that is the formula and that is the difference okay can anybody put what i just said in their own words to show me that you understand it today or what did you come to understand
c you are trying to say that all the shapes are like basically 2 triangles all which shapes
all like the square the rectangle and the parallelogram and basically and yeah you said that we find the area of all those shapes kind of like we do with the triangle except we split it in half okay anybody want to change or add to
okay but again i am trying to get you to understand why those are the formulas not just to memorize it is like i tell you guys we can teach a monkey to memorize formulas right and he can memorize and he can tell it back to us or a parrot
formula you guys can understand at a higher level why that is the formula so you guys can say not only is the formula for the area of a triangle one half base times height but the reason it is that formula is because squares rectangles and parallelograms are made up of what 2 triangles 2 triangles okay all right you guys did a good job today
let us put the we didn t even use that centimeter paper paper and then can get the geoboards and rubber bands thank you
girls good morning miss teacher i hope everyone had a great president weekend got lots of rest in on 4 days off we had friday off and monday off that s a great way to relax me who didn t fight with their alarm clock at all and slept as late as they wanted all weekend
well rested okay so it was because we had abraham lincoln s birthday and george washington s birthday close together and that s why we had monday off as president s day okay now in math we have a lot to accomplish this morning and i hope you re ready to do it okay
we re going to start with our calendar math so i m going to walk to the back and you re going to turn your body toward the back and today is we re getting very close to march we re at the very end of february
math let s give him an applause like price is right number 19 okay show me where february 19 is and point to it numerator 19 and the denominator 3 and can you tell the class how do we know what number s the numerator because a backwards n is a u and u stands for up
a backwards n is a u and u stands for up and numerator begins with n so in this case it s what number is . 19 and the denominator d stands for . right go on up to the board and please use a black marker and everybody watch and student number 20 will be back there tomorrow with another problem
okay calendar we need to make our c very large so that we can all see even in the back it c a l e n d a r space math big m with points m it s okay we re getting there it s not easy writing on the board
it s a lot different than paper and 2 dots for a colon okay now i want you to put a big circle around calendar math today now as large as you can make it underneath here i want you to write 19 3 and 19 3 step aside for a 2nd what s the denominator
19 okay is it 19 mind what did he just say at the calendar that makes us remember denominator it s like an n
with what letter does it begin with 3 all right now do you remember how we take this kind of fraction and change it to a mixed number divide divide and do you remember what this kind of fraction s called when the top number is bigger than the bottom
5 improper i didn t mention that in a long time improper so now he s going to divide to turn it into a mixed number because you can t have an unbalanced thing where the top is bigger than the bottom so 3 into 19 and step aside how many 3s are in one
there you could put it there but you don t have to so we can go right into 19 19 put a one if you agree that 3 times 6 is 18 and that s about as close as you can get without going over top what s 6 times 36 times 3 is . something teen
think of 6 +6 +61818 good 18 and 9 -8 is . 9 take away 811 and one is the what the denominator step aside don t tell him remainder so we put a capital r for remainder and then a one
now step aside now do you remember how to take 6 remainder one and kind of jumble the numbers a little bit and make it a mixed number how many wholes equal 6
10 no not 1033 the divisor goes on the bottom so we say it as this girls when i say 3 let s all say it 66 i didn t say 3 i m counting it off one 3 so thank you very much let me shake your hand
here the one remainder goes here and the 3 goes on the bottom here and because we haven t done this since last week and we had a long weekend we re a little fuzzy and a little sleepy this morning but we did an awesome job of working together so remember that so student 20 who s student 20
20 will do it tomorrow and we will go through it and practice so we remember improper to mixed we divide out and that the remainder goes on top now what type of food did i tell us weeks ago to help us remember r raisins like raisin on top like it s an ice cream sundae
me okay tomorrow we ll look at number 20 now today we re going to do 2 different types of things last thursday who remembers what we did in math the whole period t last thursday do you remember what we had
fractions changing decimals to fractions changing fractions to decimals weekend i did lots of grading and lots of subjects and most of you did fairly well and on friday you ll see it in your friday folder whether you got an a a b a c a d or a u only a couple people had trouble most everybody did very well
sheet put the date 2 19 13 and when i look at the date today are they all even odd or mixed 219 odd 13 odd good
writing some review problems to study and put a little cloud around it these are 3 most common errors that people made last week and i want to make sure you understand it there was a question about a man or a boy named sam and he was taking a test question and it asked about correct and incorrect
wrong in is a prefix meaning not and correct means all right right so i want you to go ahead and write this problem as neatly as you can and sam answered a n s w e r e d let s repeat the spelling because that might be on spelling this week
c e sam answered 2 tenths of his science quiz incorrectly i n c 0 repeat i n c 0 r r l y when i say incorrectly does that mean right or wrong wrong wrong incorrectly means the prefix in means not
so go ahead and put a box around in and put parentheses not under it so you ll know if that comes up again and you forget that in means not incorrectly what fraction of the questions did he answer correctly
what fraction of the answers did he answer correctly write i m going to walk around and see who s copying that correctly and then we ll do the next part
i see some good handwriting and i see some people keeping up very well can you see the board okay
what fraction of the answers did he answer correctly you need a question mark at the end it s a question with what you too question mark sam answered 2 tenths of his science quiz incorrectly what fraction of the answers did he answer correctly
so i know i need to find a fraction so let s put a box around fraction that s definitely a key word and correctly we need to know a fraction and we need to know correctly
and you didn t have to write all that on the test you just had to read it and figure it out but we re going through it slowly in parts and kind of dissecting the question to make sure we understand it what fraction of the answers did he answer correctly i put in boxes and write your answer as a fraction and a decimal equivalent so what are 2 things they want us to give 2 forms of the answer
a decimal and a fraction so i definitely have to put a box around fraction and decimal because if i do 2 fractions i m going to get it wrong decimal and what do all decimals have in them right and all fractions have a numerator and a denominator so i ve got to make sure i ve got one of each
now his science quiz had how many questions on it had how many lot a lot okay well you re probably thinking of our science quiz we usually have a lot 10 yes there were 10 questions because he answered 2 tenths of his science quiz incorrectly
so underneath it i m out of room i want you to draw a science test draw a piece of paper and write test we re not going to write science right now put a little wavy line on test and when i number it how many should i number down questions how many parts were on the test
10 i don t care if you have to write it like 2 columns of 5 like i m doing it okay so there are 10 possible questions now are you with me 2 so what should i do i m not going to write a bunch of science questions and answers when i solve this but i m just going to go la la la la la everybody say la la la la la la la la la la
and you re just going to make a little wavy line as if there was some kind of question there it might have been a multiple choice or a true false or a matching we re just putting our la la la la wavy line to represent an answer to a question 2 so pick any 2 that you want to pretend that he got wrong pick any 9 huh and 3 okay so anything would be okay
wrong it doesn t matter if you pick the same numbers as me or not any 2 you mark them wrong to show he got 2 tenths incorrectly so we can be sure that drawing a picture helps us understand now if he missed 2 and we want to find out how many he got correct how do i figure that out
subtract 10 from 2 okay there s 10 total questions and he got 2 wrong i can do 10 total questions minus the 2 wrong so i m going to put 10 total t 0 t a l -2 wrong equals what 10 take away 28 good girl
8 and thank you class for being quiet and letting her think it out without yelling it out you gave her wait time which is so important that we be considerate that we all work at different speeds correct so next to that i m going to write correct c 0 r r e c t
h 8 tenths 8 tenths so as a fraction i m going to draw an arrow and i m going to put 8 tenths now as a decimal what am i going to write for a decimal for 8 tenths .8.8 and what s another way to do it besides .80.80.80 in the ones with 8 tenths now many of you got this right but many of you got this wrong
who thinks they got it right on thursday good wrong the people who got it wrong the main problem was they read it too fast and they read correctly but they didn t do it correctly they wrote 2 tenths and they wrote .2 and 0.2 words they just saw the words here and they put them in the problem answer but they didn t read the whole thing about incorrect and correct and that s why they didn t solve it that way
do you remember we had some problems like this last week with the pie and we said what part was eaten and what part was no eaten thing so now you know whenever you get a question about a person on a quiz or a test make yourself a picture of a quiz or a test with that number of questions and mark out how many they got wrong or how many they got right and even if you didn t do it like subtraction what else could you have done there if i didn t subtract on this how else could i find how many were correct if 2 were wrong
just . count count i could have gone 12345678 and i still would have gotten 8 correct 8 out of 10 or .8 or 0.8 who thought it was a really hard question themselves who thinks it s much easier now when you draw a picture boys and girls have we talked to many times about word problems and drawing pictures
no the more you draw pictures and you take words and pictures and you put it together the better chance you re going to get it right pictures and they don t have to be gorgeous they don t have to look like art but if you draw pictures and you dissect it with boxes you re going to do a whole lot better missed i m going to show you the 2nd and the 3rd and then we re going to go on to the beginning of our new unit
problem this is a much much shorter one write down solve s 0 l v e dot dot 8 tenths +7 hundredths and you might remember this was on the back of the test on the top that a lot of you made a silly mistake on this
and what we re going to do now is give each of you an elbow partner be somebody that s next to you because your elbows are on your right and your left right
while now i will tell you who your elbow partner is in a weird situation if we re not there and you re going to try and solve this both of you in your notebooks together as partners and then we re going to talk about it right so who do you think your elbow partner is right you re going to be with so move back to the corner
and you 2 girls right here and and i ve already said you 2 and you 2 go and and you 2 boys right here now elbow partners very gently tap elbows this you don t want to do it too hard gentle like you nudge somebody right
partner okay now i want you to salute your elbow partner and say hi elbow partner hi elbow partner say we are going to solve math together we are going to solve math together
partners now everybody wrote this problem talk to your elbow partner for about 60 seconds 90 seconds about how you re going to solve it this talk about how you re going to do it don t just do it
but we all agree it s the same okay but you figured it out if i call you up are you going to be able to explain what you did or just pop up an answer yes we got it i like the way you re saying some different examples and different forms that s good
shared and i see a lot of wonderful answers but i hope we can explain it done now i will tell you 1st that many of you not many maybe about 7 people got that wrong and i consider that too many what they did is they didn t look carefully at the problem just like they didn t look carefully at the word problem and they just went 0 i know
8 +7 that s 15 and i ll just copy 100 did they get it right no there were about 7 people that did that and got it wrong because they saw a plus sign and they thought about adding fractions and they just added now the problem with this is you had different denominators or different amounts in decimals up yes 8 tenths equals a different amount in hundredths right how many hundredths is 8 tenths do you know
8 tenths 8 tenths come over here equals how many hundredths remember this last week 10 and whatever i do on the bottom i do on the . is . 8080 so we just found out that 8 tenths is 80 hundredths and how do we change that to a decimal
0 point . 80 that s 80 hundredths good right so when i add 8 hundredths +7 hundredths what write here what you think the total will be
good and if i switched it to a decimal which i don t have to do here but just so i know the difference it would look like that around who knows for a fact they put 15 here by mistake when they did it never ever ever add the top together unless the bottom is the same right song never ever ever add the denominators together and make sure that they re both the same
you now that was the 2nd problem many of us missed the 3rd one is kind of close to this and it will only take a minute and then we ll start our new unit i really feel strongly that if i just moved on with the new unit today and didn t go over 3 that a lot of people missed then you all might miss it on the crct and we wouldn t want that to happen so it s worth me taking a few minutes to pick out 3 that i think we need to know well
now this one i want you to write complete c 0 m repeat c 0 m p l e t e t e complete the inequality . huh i n e q u repeat i n e q u a l i t y
l i t y complete the inequality using drop the e and add i n g using less than or greater than
c . we can t just say 7 s bigger than 3 and make his symbol right here wrong why is that wrong can you tell me why 100 what about the 100 are they equal right now at the bottom
bottom so how do i change 3 tenths to something over 100 so i can compare them 11010 and 3 times 10 is . no try it again 3 times 1030 so now i ve changed this to an equal problem to show that 3 tenths is 30 hundredths so now i can compare 30 hundredths and 7 hundredths and which one s bigger
number one or number 2 which one s bigger who agrees with him number one because if i have 30 pieces of pie out of 100 slices my tummy s going to be a whole lot fuller than if i only have 7 out of 100 and remember you can draw the little teeth in to make sure you remember he s very hungry now there s another method to this that you should remember from when we did fractions a while ago
d 3 to get to 10 you need 71s and 7 to get 100 means a lot more than very good
thinking he said if you ate 3 of something and there were 10 slices you would need to eat 7 more to get there yes you remember the other way that i taught you a long time ago
yeah because and then there s the okay so when we draw the pictures 3 tenths how many lines do i make for some 10 spaces do you remember missus teacher s art stinks so my friends in other states that are watching this my art stinks so the class already knows that but we ll do it quick so you get the idea
123456789 i ve got to make one more since i didn t make it a set 3 tenths not quite even i have to shade in how many to show 3 tenths 3 so quickly i m going to pick any 3123 and it doesn t matter if you do 3 in a row any 3 is fine 10 and then if i did 100 what s that thing for breakfast that we always draw that has 100 squares
no can we draw french toast yes it doesn t work as good french toast is a square like a waffle but it doesn t have all the little boxes
right now i m not going to draw 100 boxes but you would have 9 across 9 down and 10 spaces of each and you would shade in 7 anywhere 1234567 and i would have 10 by 10 for 100 right
7 out of all 100 when i had all my lines and boxes would not be as much as the 3 tenths make it that way and who remembers something about going this way and this way from fractions
it cross multiplication so remember we learned a long time ago about a month ago that you can go diagonally across to compare 3 okay now which is bigger 300 or 70 here yes so if you did it that way the old way i taught you you d get it right and if you did it this way with pictures you d get it right
and if you changed it to hundredths this way you d get it right but somehow some of you said well 7 s bigger than 3 so i ll just make it that way and got it wrong yes 0 yes you re really good 5 down with a line across in the middle right i m just trying to save some time so we can get in our geometry now how many of you think be honest it s okay we re all friends who thinks they missed maybe at least one out of those 3
now who thinks it was worth me taking the time to go over that so if it comes up in the future like on benchmark or crct you re going to get those kind of problems those were the 3 that were most commonly missed but there were many a s and b s and the main thing is go slowly can check your work and you won t make those problems
now everybody we re going to stretch a little keep your notebook out before we get into geometry
back 71234567 forward 1234567 now who remembers geometry from 3rd grade desk geometry is a study
it s not biology it s not chemistry because biology and chemistry are what subject morning not today but we huh work what subject is biology chemistry animals plants planets science so geometry almost sounds like a science word but it s not it s a math word
and it s got a word in the front of it g e 0 anyone know what g e 0 means means geo is not really a graphic organizer no but that s a good try geograph geograph what does that mean
bands that s dots and making a picture geology the study of rocks the study of rocks in 3rd grade didn t you do the study of rocks and minerals and you learned igneous sedimentary and metamorphic the 3 types and you studied lots of different rocks and which one goes in which group right but in geometry we re going to study about shapes
and the main meaning is the branch of math dealing with the properties measurement and relationships of points lines and solids cube okay so today we re going to focus on mostly points and lines
tomorrow we re going to go into different types of quadrilaterals which is a big word we ll talk about at the end and then the next day we ll talk about angles and triangles vocabulary so we re taking a big break from fractions and decimals and numbers and multiplying and dividing
and what i have found in the past is a lot of students who don t do as well with multiplying and long division and decimals and fractions they go way up in geometry because geometry of almost all the math we do this year it s the most like reading because it s a lot of words and shapes just like vocabulary and stories so if you can learn your vocabulary it s easy if you have trouble with vocabulary you ve just got to do a lot of drill and practice and we ll get there so i need to tell me my new paper passers today
and c you give a flip book to the girls and you give one to the boys and it doesn t matter what color you get it doesn t matter what kind you get and let s see can you tell us what we use the flip books for learn can you tell us what we used it for us lots of times on weekends or after school missus
teacher makes a whole lot of these to help us study and what are they for study problems and they re used for vocabulary and they re used for vocabulary okay said it s used mainly for vocabulary or new things we re learning a . vocabulary we write a vocabulary word and then we lift it up and we write the answer of what it means and we use these for what
study and do we use it just for the test or do we use it all year long long whose been saving these all year in science and social studies and math and reading and we learned words like idioms and synonyms and antonyms and all kinds of things and we still can practice these
n okay so you can use any pen pencil or marker you want and what do we usually do on the back right on the back flip it now write your name large and an x and a line for a parent s signature this i don t know 0 so you can know it and to study so but what does an x and a line mean
signature well i don t just want your parent s autograph there s a reason why so they can know when we have the test so they can help you before the test by drilling it and they know something important is coming up and that will help us because you want to see that we actually started in have your parent involved with it and if the parent actually signs it they know we have a test you know we have and they can drill you and hold it while they go through it and it s something a little more fun than a worksheet
so flip back to the front and in your very best writing 1st don t write this yet we re going to talk about our topic for today and what s our eq stand for essential . essential . quiz quiz no
d essential question essential question essential question essential s very important so our new essential question is what what are some . geometric geometric so we re going to go over just the basic ones on solids forget that on lines today that are the most important
so on the very top where your 2 staples are i want you to write geometry neatly g e 0 repeat g e 0 m e t m e t r y terms t e r m s terms and you can make a wavy line under both
and everybody put an x and a line for a parent s signature on the back it s going to be signed tonight right okay now when you go to your 1st colored flap you re going to write the word point spell point p 0 i n t p 0 i n t
flap this is the easiest one of all because a point is like a period right m it s like a circle and it s and it s colored in dark dot so underneath the flap i want you to put a dot letter you don t just pick d because you re name s or e because your name s
in a book or on a workbook page or in a worksheet it could have any letter w and it doesn t matter if i put the w you can do it different ways on the side or i put it on top
books and you need to write a point is a location in space a point is a location in space
place okay like disney world s a place in orlando is so it s a point that represents a spot a point is a location in space what disney world is in florida in orlando florida right there so it s represented by a letter and it s a location in space
let s put a start in front of a point so when mom and dad say what is a point you don t just say a little dot anymore you say a location in space in 3rd grade you might have said a little dot in 2nd grade you might have said a period but now we re 4th grade so we have to say a location in space which kind of sounds like science
flap and on the 2nd flap i want you to think of a word beginning with l hand it s 4 letters and it s when you have an arrow on both ends line so here we re going to write line capital l i n e and for a line you have a long arrow like that
it can be horizontal which means across or it could be vertical or it could be diagonal line and it s named by 2 points that are capital letters or small letters it doesn t matter which a b i m going to call this line c d
e f very often they re going to have letters that come consecutively s each other yeah like in a b c order like b comes right after a and d comes right after c though sometimes it might say a t but most of the time you re going to get 2 letters that are named in order
young so 2 letters represent a line and they have little dots on them which are . points so a line is represented by 2 letters and 2 points and you need to write for the definition with a star a line extends e x t e n d s repeat
if you don t write this but if you just have that that is not a line what s different from this don t draw this but what s the difference between this and this word it was a b and you had a line c d and then you had a diagonal one to show the different e f
you now if you re one of those quick writers you should be reading back to yourself trying to get it in your head a line extends without ends in opposite directions a b c d and e f opposite directions could be across vertical or diagonal
no as long as it has an arrow on both ends it is a line and 2 letters to name that line here a line extends without ends in opposite directions okay now if i take both my hands and i m in pe class and the pe teacher tells me to stretch and i go like this am i a line
g because of your head well because of my head arrows now if i had an arrow here and an arrow here but i have end points my hands are end points going my hands don t keep going until they go on and on and on and on and on in space right so a line extends without ends in opposite directions
yes yeah it could be another thing i used last year besides pretzels and i ll bring in some tomorrow is spaghetti noodles pasta noodles are great for gluing on paper shapes but they re usually curly some not not the straight like angel hair pasta straight line all right the next one we re going to do is the one that has the end points
so on your next flap i want you to write line segment s e g m e n t segment who remembers that word from 3rd grade you nobody else remembers line segment tell me did you do this geometry at the end of last year or the middle do you think
so it was earlier in the year than now like maybe before christmas yes you forgot couldn t of be in the line of segment
no okay so a line segment has 2 end points and the line in the middle it does not have an arrow or it has 2 end points segment means part
now we re only going to do this one and a little bit more and then we re going to play a little game because i know you need to get up and move we ve been sitting for quite a while learning about all of this segment means part of a line and is named with 2 points out so if i took a b here and i took this out and i put it over here it would look like this
so that one has no arrows and this one does have arrows and it s a segment because it has 2 end points lot in the word segment how many e s are there 2 if you put a little box around both e s this will help you remember if you put a little box around both e s and think of end point when you see e that will help you remember 2 end points because segment has 2 e s
so next to that put 2 end points 2 e s 2 end points e s 2 line only has one only has one so it keeps on going but segment has 2 e s so that means 2 end points you all know i mean end points like the back of the lines
now you can have it this way just like before c d it could be diagonal f g and it doesn t have to be the name of it on the end points you might have points in the middle of it like t r so it could have 4 points with 2 end points and 2 in the middle and all of those are different kinds of segments and why did i say the 2 e s would help us remember end points
so it will help you remember why did i put boxes on the e s e s mean . 2 end points these are the 2 end points
segment line segment okay so this is a point w you don t need to write this i m just catching up with the people who were done early this is a line j k and this is segment l m
yes okay can we at study hall you can fix it up with me okay we ll work on that game okay so we ve done point line and line segment and we re going to do just one more for right now and that one begins with an r and it s also somebody s name and it s 3 letters
who knows what it is it begins with an r it s a boy s name and it s 3 letters roy what roy no but roy is a boy s name and it is 3 letters you did pretty good with that ray ray good so on your next one write the word ray r a y
like it s like when you okay she said when you do multiplication you draw an array don t write this in the box that s when you have dots or pictures that represent a problem don t put this in your flip book but that would be 3 times 3 which made 9 right so you re right that does have the word ray in it and i m glad you came up with that but that s not geometry
geometry like the line in the middle of a line like it s a dot in the middle of the line well the dot in the middle of a line is the segment a ray has a and what else good a ray has a and an arrow it s got a mixture a and an arrow
it has one endpoint so let s write this a ray a space ray don t write array like the multiplication a ray has one endpoint a compound it goes together a ray has one endpoint and one arrow
so it stops at one and it keeps on going in the other letters so if i do this this is ray t u the endpoint is t and u is anywhere on the line
and if i make it go this way and i call this one m n we always say the endpoint 1st m n and it looks like it s backwards s looking like i m crazy right
right even though it looks like we always read left to right when you name an endpoint you do the a ray you do the endpoint and then the other point endpoint so if you had this way this could be ray s t
and if you had this way this could be l j okay so the endpoint always goes 1st then the other point it what in the sky that has a ray in it that s very bright
pictures aren t these rays that come and hit you when you re getting a suntan at the beach you have an endpoint and it keeps going on and on this way and then it bounces off on your body and it gives you a suntan right it keeps going this way but there s endpoints at the sun this way so all of these are called the sun s rays yes and the clouds block the sun you ll see the rays come out from the sun right if the clouds block the sun and you don t see the yellow but you can still feel the heat and you can see the rays
you don t see it that well but sometimes you can see it but you knew they were called rays since you were little you just didn t know they were a geometry word okay so so far we have geometry terms we have point line line segment and ray and we re getting low on time so i m going to save angle and perpendicular and intersecting for tomorrow so we did half our flip book do you think it would still be good to get this signed
words so when you have finished turn it face down and face me and we re going to do something fun so when are we going to finish it words but you re going to start learning those tonight and it goes with your homework now i m going to give some people some cards when you get it i want you just to look at it and we re going to play a little matching game i m going to turn some things around and i m going to go to the back of the room and i m going to ask some people to try to make a match when i call for something
i m going to hold off the ones i thought that i was going to get to and when you get it think about what it is it i m going to save the ones that i m not going to get to until tomorrow be patient
it study what it is and don t talk
i like the way you re being quiet as i m passing something out that you re going to move around and try to figure out who you can match with
a lot of the ones that i had planned to do i thought we d have more time for so i m kind of summing it up here okay now if you didn t get one just watch you ll definitely get one tomorrow when we go over the other half
now i want you to look carefully and face the back of the room row look is going to get up you guys watch turn your chair this way so you can see me well and we re all facing and you can put the card on your lap now i m going to call one person s card and if you think you have something that matches it i want you to come up
anybody if you re just watching you ll get a card tomorrow on angles or quadrilaterals the next words coming if you have a picture or a word that somehow represents point r come to the back
one tip the card facing the class the card facing the class so we can see one okay now she has this
r okay because it has a point r on it yes it does contain the point r but it s not a point r it s a what minute now let s give these 2 people a hand because they matched correctly a point has to be just a and the letter to be correct even though it s a point on the line it s correct but we don t want the one that contained now since you 2 are done take your parts and come sit on the floor right here
and now if you have anything that says segment q r come to the back this this let s talk about it
say line segment q r so we know we need the letters q r in it if we have r s or j u it s not right and we know a line segment has 2 e s and 2 e s mean two . endpoints good you re learning quickly endpoints now he s got the letters q r but is this a line segment the symbol on the top
no no it s a ray it s an endpoint and an arrow so i m afraid you ll have to sit down but you were close see let me see all you okay now sit q r yes that s the symbol a little symbol of a straight line with endpoints you are correct
here now back up she s got q and r with 2 end points in a line with no arrows not does she have an endpoint on the left and an endpoint on the right
matches segment q r is a line above q r means the short way of writing it as a symbol q r in the endpoint lines and then the word line segment q r all 3 match here take these and we ll use these for tomorrow for review down now let me see sit down properly
again if you think you have line q r or anything that represents line q r come to the back q r come on my line q r people go if you think you need to be here come if not you make your own decision and my sitters sit quietly down
say a line endpoints arrows arrows arrows means line or segment line so 2 endpoints with arrows no endpoints is a line
has has the shortcut way the arrow above the symbol q r means line here and we still have a few more cards out as we finish up today s lesson
q r ray q r q r now we re not talking about the boy ray here and i know we re not talking about the boy ray because we have what s the word ray we have no capital r so we re not talking about a boy named ray and he s got a q and r okay so we re talking about can you sit quietly
lunchtime ray q r means what 2 things are on a ray that we just learned point an arrow keeps on going and an endpoint on the other like the sun s rays that now she s got this an endpoint and an arrow q on the end r is somewhere on the line it keeps on going like the sun s rays and you ve got q r with the little symbol on the end and a ray
this is the symbol so you 3 take a bow and go sit down done okay point j go face the front see she s got the letters point j capital
dot dot and he s got the point j and it doesn t matter if the j s on the left the right top or bottom p q who else has segment p q segment what letter 2 times
b two . points and what are those points called up p q with a line above it means segment not an arrow a piece of a line and there s p q with 2 end points now it does make it easier because we have the letters to find the letters on the card but we have to keep straight
segment one endpoint one arrow ray down now everybody back to your desk now we re going to review and end our lesson now we re going to review with our bodies in about one minute
still today we did a number of different things we reviewed our decimal and fraction test 3 common errors correct yeah we did a flip book on learning new vocabulary correct yes we didn t get it all the way through because of the time and sometimes it s hard to figure out exactly how far we can go book we did point line line segment and ray
now to end our lesson i want you to use this to be a point ray now if you re making a line stop if you re making a line what do you need 2 of
j if you re making a line what do you need 2 of on the ends you need 2 arrows 2 arrows agree put a 2 up if you disagree for a line you need 2 arrows
know because of what i can t hear you does a line go on and on forever no arrows everybody make 2 v s like this so it looks like arrows okay it goes on and on forever and a segment has what 2 vowels in it
two . 2 vowels what are the 2 vowels in segment that we practiced e e s so 2 e s means 2 endpoints make a line with 2 endpoints
segment segment ray
okay listen up up i am going to be videotaped don t do that again please go sit down please i m going to be videotaped for math today
i don t like that you do whatever you feel like you re the only one that got up and tried to look at it
we re also going to be videotaped tomorrow why hello do you remember last year yeah that s always like this
we aren t talking but i m going to be teaching math like we did in the morning okay
and then i have and will be going to the honor roll assembly with miss c at 10 15
the only thing is that it s still going on right now no
why are we going to send the kid that didn t get honor roll that doesn t make any sense it would be sweet if you got on the honor roll and then you could go with then you can watch all you want
don t laugh because you re not on honor roll no i didn t say because all of you have the opportunity to turn around your grade i should have more than just 3 what if the whole class got honor roll
okay so everyone right now have your white board out have your dmr out white board dmr math notebook volume one math book homework listen okay listen
myself white board dmr math notebook you want to take them now j you re going to go with miss m
desk and then math notebook math book homework from yesterday those are the things that you need okay
and
it who still needs a marker i need one i need one
remember when we get up from our seat we need to push our chair in
that s for you
okay does everyone have i ll get some more dry erase markers all right the 1st thing we re going to do is go over the dmr and then we ll do our calendar math
you re right okay you know what sit down sit down
down if your marker is not working what i need you to do instead of shouting out is i need you to just raise your hand . where s your marker at it i need a new one too miss t marker boys and girls some of you are saying things are wrong with your marker when they work perfectly fine
give me the markers and go sit down please this is taking way too long what s the matter yes hurry up
problem there s a box of tissue on the table but there always is j i didn t get a marker thank you
all right number one write the fractions and mixed numbers on the number line below so you are given a number line 0 through 3
and there s one and 2 and then you do have the half way points in between the whole numbers mark correct yes what would this half way point be
one half one half when i was looking around earlier i saw a lot of you this continues to happen i saw a lot of you not fill the fractions on your number line and just placing stuff in work i m telling you that extra work will pay off i did not say to do it on your white board because when you re writing on your white board then other people think they can write on their white board
now our dmr is what we re writing on later okay so if this is one half right here i m passing the whole number one moving to this mark which make it what a half one and one half one and one half then i move past the whole number 2 to this half way mark 2 and one half
and then i m going to draw lines to separate draw a half way line between 0 and one half which will be what 14th 14th and then i draw another half way between one half and one that would be . 3 fourths 3 fourths i hope we re all filling it in in did we not go over this yesterday
right and i told you you need to be doing this especially for our tomorrow yes right you weren t here so just do what i m doing
one whole so half way between one whole and one and one half is what 14th one and 14th because look it i m splitting if i split one half in half i get 14th 0 all right then between one half and 21 and one half in 2 is what
2 fourths i mean 3 fourths what and 3 fourths what s my whole number 11 and 3 fourths and then here s 2 so this would be . then . 2 and 3 fourths 2 and 3 fourths okay
the last thing i want to do is fill my eighths what is half of 14th 18th 18th so i m going to use a different color for my eighths here s 0 here s on 4th so half of that would be 18th this would be 2 eighths this would be . 33 eighths 4 eighths which is the same as one half so this would be ..
5 eighths 5 eighths 6 eighths which is the same as 3 fourths so then this would be . 7 eighths 7 eighths this would be 88s or . one whole when my numerator and denominator are the same it is equal to one whole then i would suggest you need like what can t you see
enough no i can t see like what do you mean like you don t understand it blurry is that better yeah that s better okay all right continuing on
this would be 8 eighths so then i start over again at . one and 18th one and 18th one and 2 eighths one and . 3 eighths one and 48s one and . 5 eighths 5 eighths one and 6 eighths one and . 7 eighths 7 eighths one and 8 eighths or ..
again so this would be 2 and one eighths 2 and 2 eighths 2 and 3 eighths 2 and 4 eighths 2 and 5 eighths 2 and 6 eighths and then . 2 and 7 eighths 2 and 7 eighths fantastic good job all right so now this since i ve got all this filled in and you ve got it all filled in on your dmr right
yeah placing i don t know what i did with my dmr down placing the fractions on my number line will now be very simple because i ve already them they re all laid out for me right yes here s one half right there so you can i don t know put a star on it write one half above it
can we write any kind of you can put any kind of shape the next one is 14th here we go here s my 14th and then we ve got 7 eighths here s my 7 eighths and then finally 2 and 3 fourths so i need to find my whole number 2 and i go this way on my number line here s 2
what 3 close to 3 here s my 30 there s 2 and 3 fourths okay how many of you got that one correct line once we filled in our number line did you notice any mistakes you made and then you fixed it
yes i good good good good i okay but you fixed it right one find the quotient of 891 divided by 9
were you able to take out 100 groups of 9 not because that would make it 900 much so if i can t do 9 times 100 what could i do 999 times 99 might be hard to do in my head
wait let s see how about 100 we just said we can t do 100 because 9 times 100 will give us 100 891 since we can t do 9 times 100 let s choose another group of 10 that we could do 9 times 90 99 times 90 sounds good okay 9 times 50 would be another good one because we know our 5s really well
but let s go with 9 times 90 because remember that i have told you several times the higher you re able to go here the less steps you re going to have make and the less mistakes that you will end up making all right so 9 times 9 is
9181 excuse me 9 times 9 is 81 810 810 very good
excuse me wait
when i ask a question i want you to think before you re blurting out
one -0 is . 19 minus one ..
you and the things you re saying and doing right now are really inappropriate down you re being very rude right now
whatsoever 9 -1910s -810s 8 i m sorry 9 times is one 800 -800 leaves me with 0s can you stop please so now i have 81 right why are you raising your hand right now
me i was going to say you could do 9 times 9 right i haven t gotten there yet though so you re raising your hand ahead of time all right so i have 81 now we need to think 8199 because why yes 9 times 9 equals 81
so 9 times 9 i write my 81 subtract 81 -81 is 0 remainder it is unnecessary for me to write remainder 0 that but what i do need to do is i need to count 90 +9 equals ..
99 remainder 0 99 i don t have to do remainder 0 because i have no remainder so 9 times 99 is 891
one write the math symbol in the box that will correctly complete the equation remember an equation is having the equal sign in the center showing that this side is equal to this side that video camera is right on you
stop so i ve 24 +8 correct yep equals 84 who can tell me what do we need to figure out 1st doing this problem
1st we need to figure out what s yes we need to figure we need to find out because we know we have all the information we need right here to solve for this side
32 and if you think 32 is 4 groups of 8 because 24 is 3 groups of 8 +one more group will give me a total of 4 groups of 8 32 equals 8 times 4 do not mess with those so what do i need to do to the 8 and i just gave you a hint right
we said 8 groups of 4 equals 32 so what symbol would i place here 32 yes so then if i solve this 32 equals 32 they are equal so multiplication symbol is my answer all right next one
donna cut a piece of rope that was 6 and 32 100 meters long which of the numbers below round to 6 and 32 100 to can you call us up to do it on the i think i am yesterday i need though the talking in between i had a lot of people start a conversation
it i don t know so if you found that shouldn t you raise your hand shouldn t you raise your hand and say missus right 0 because i see
321 1000 you re going to be rounding that one up so 6 and 321 1000
you re going to round it to the nearest 100 ths place no that s okay that s okay place just underline it circle the neighbor
do fantastic perfect all right so did this number 6 and 321 1000 round to 6 and 32 100 yes so this is a choice okay that is one that you would pick 329 1000 would you round that one for me please
you re being very inappropriate right now desk thank you
so 6 and 329 1000 29 and you re going to round it to the nearest 100th place underline the 100 ths place circle the neighbor you re making a lot of noise 9 tells the 2 to do what
fantastic he knows the 9 tells the 2 to go up by one so that 2 turns into a 3 no so that is not it
select all right next one 6 and 299 i want to see s not here what the one below and which of the numbers below round to 6 and 32 100 nobody why haven t i because i do this on purpose
dear why can t she come up and do 6 and 1000 the people that can t be on the camera are the ones that can t do this
perfect she underlined the 100 ths place right away circled the neighbor this just ignore him behind you okay all right if this 9 tells us to do what a . if i add one to this then it will become a ..
1010 so knows that this will become a 10 so she brings this one carries it over to the 2 turned it into a 3 she could do one of 2 things she could leave it just like this 6 and 3 10 or she could put that 0 in the place of where that 9 was where the 9 turned into a 10 put a 0 there 6 and 30 100 ths
but we know that 6 and 3 10 and 6 and 31 100 is the same value no no it did not so that s not a choice let s look at the next one now the next one 6 and 52 100 let s talk about this one really quickly
i m not going to have someone come up and do it because if i underline my rounding place which is the 2 in the 100 ths place i ve got a 0 in that place holder same so this is going to stay the same it does not round to 6 and 32 100 so it s not an answer choice
324 1000 no you act like i look specifically dang that s i m going to put it back you act like i do that
them all right so 6 and 324 1000 neighbor 4 tells the 2 to do what
same stay the same so does that round to 6 and 32 100 yeah in fact it s only 2 out of what 4 no 55 yep so those 2 out of the 52 fifths yes it is 2 fifths good
one whole shade the model below to represent one and 85 100 square yes yes fantastic now stop that s unnecessary all right how many of that 2nd one needs to be shaded in
85 85 units or cubes our of 100 rows 880 i m not going to write it rows 88 whole no not 80 rows because each row is worth one 10 i have 8 10
you re going to do 8 rows shade in 8 rows and then how many in that ninth row are you going to shade in 8512345678 you only shaded in 8 whole rows
5 100 good okay all right glue your dmr in your notebook put it away please
we just did it right now take out your math homework make sure your name is on the top i m going to collect it from you can i collect no what s this it s not finished no it is or it is not
i m confused did you just say you don t put your name on it boys and girls please put your name on your math homework yeah it was 11 through 14 that s okay i ll understand it
i went to the other page and did it okay you are going to need your dry erase marker and your eraser and your board
name you know what i like how most of you are sitting quietly i m sorry missus
for for not writing my name that needs to be glued in your notebook honey
okay so today we re going to review for tomorrow s assessment and let s think of all the stuff that we ve learned this week the test assessment on monday we did metric units liquid capacity right milliliters liters let s do one thing really quickly
there s one tiny itty bitty thing that i want to add to your notes so if you could do me a favor because you already have your math homework at your desk open back to metric liquid capacity please
i shouldn t have to say something 4 times to get everyone to finally do it open your math notebook to the notes that we took on the metric units of liquid capacity you should
in all right because i don t want you writing it somewhere else okay you ve got to take more time on your notes okay honey yes all right so this is on our metric units of liquid capacity yes and remember you should have been studying your notes every night right
we re going to add one little thing that s very very important and actually we re going to be testing on it tomorrow and in a couple of weeks on the cfa and it s just one little thing that we need to add under milliliter so milliliter what we wrote so far you don t have to rewrite it stop right there
okay who s got nice neat notes has nice neat notes kind of all right we said hold on
i need someone that has nice neat notes did we only don t cover it up that s not okay
better okay what you should have written for milliliter go write your name on the board again i don t care
what you should have written and a lot of you didn t is that for milliliter what you should have written down is that it s about an eyedropper full
and something that i want to add to that so if you didn t write that which many of you didn t because i just looked write that down an eyedropper full most of you have it down but a lot of you don t the other thing i want to add to that is a little specific and a little more easier for you to understand is that a milliliter is about 4 drops of water
4 drops 4 drops of water so underneath an eyedropper full i want you to write kind of big 4 drops of water well i shouldn t just say of water i should say of liquid how about that liquid because water ain t a liquid well water is liquid but water s kind of specific yes
down i think that that s something that you will have better luck with remembering plus you re going to be tested on that exact information amount think 4 drops of water 1234 it s a tiny amount of water right yes a milliliter is tiny a milliliter is a tiny amount
remember when i showed you this is just a little more than a milliliter i m sorry wrong this is just a little more than a liter so imagine 4000 drops of water because how many milliliters are in a liter a 2000 so 4 drops of water times 1000 is 4 so in here there are 4000 there will be 4000 drops of water
okay so split that and divide it by 4 there s 1000 milliliters in this container that s small it s small i know so a milliliter is tiny no i don t think you understand that i m being videotaped right now
okay so you re going to get up in the middle of me being videotaped in front of the camera some of us need to be aware of what s going on in here okay so we re going to play a jeopardy yes to review yes i m going to move a couple people so we can make teams
and i m going to have you sit at this table okay take your white board with you because we re going to be writing answers on a white board are we going to be taking turns or is it like each person against the other and i m going to have you take your white boards and move over to s group
okay you just worry about yourself i know you re trying to be helpful but he s in a bad mood right now deal i m going to get glasses 0 you are
but i have to go to the eye doctor okay no he s cool he can just get s chair no honey
right we ve got our categories so we ve got linear and i just heard say liner because it does the word line is in it right for something about lines and ear no it s lines and length length linear is length
that s to measure so if i m going to measure something what s the best unit use units time obviously time is it s like a bag it s like random questions random random questions okay
so i ve got group one in the back 234 okay
1234 all right okay so i will keep score i m just going to keep score right here
1234 i ve got room over here i m going to be standing over here okay so we re going to start we ll just start with the back table they re going to make a choice on what they want as their category okay
question now when i show the question i need everyone to think about it think about their answer you because if they get it wrong it goes to the next team
continues sit down if there s like 4 questions and each table gets it wrong then since we re group 4 we ll be the last ones to get it right right and the 1st ones and then okay okay
now let s say the 1st group one stop talking let s say group one gets it wrong and then it goes to group 22 so group 2 could get in the lead right away okay
all right so team one group one which category would you like and how many points would you like
time for one time for one point yes i thought it said pint it does look like pint i might have to double click that how . how 0 my word
question what temperature i hope this thing isn t messed up what temperature is it outside if it s freezing in degrees fahrenheit degrees fahrenheit for freezing okay and we re going to just cross our fingers that isn t screwed up the whole time
b now team one well you need to write it down on your board big all right group one i would like you to answer please 32 degrees fahrenheit 32 degrees fahrenheit you guys need listen listen
something i noticed that not everyone did some people did some people didn t i need everyone writing the answer on their board everyone writing the answer on their board can i move no you cannot move 32 degrees 0 wait a 2nd i screwed up
okay so time is the temperature i don t know hey one so group one you got one point for that one
group 2 which category and how many points we re next quickly please
grab bag 5 points how many years are in a decade board did you guys discuss at all
okay all right 10 is it so team 2 got 5 points for that one actually what i m going to do is make all right what happened to the thing there are 10 years in a decade all right group 3
points how about for 5 for 5 points let s hope that it s not messed up how many tons woo how many tons are in £8000
discuss in your group hold on let me see if all the groups are getting it see how many tons are in £8000 it yeah 4
is okay can you tell the class and i think a couple other groups got it can you tell the class how you got it because 24 is 8 and if there s 2 in every £1000 every time and just timesed and it s 8000 yes so if you divided that 8000 up into groups of £2000 you get 4 groups
yeah nice job 4 tons equals £8000 much 5 points all right measure 5 points what is the best form of measurement to find the amount of water in a swimming pool
everyone needs to be writing it down in their boards that way i ve got everyone participating everyone s working miss c that s easy well then write it down on your board and figure it out people might argue that yours was easy okay what do you got for me
yes okay it s back to group one quiet linear for 5 points linear for 5 points 0 let me see if i can move this out of the way
how many yards are in a mile
think how many yards are in a mile
what do you guys think
board you re not even going to write down a guess you don t want to write down a guess let me see right no
right okay you guys . is that what you thought your group no not right no it listen no stop stop let me help you out with this one okay
there are 5000 this is not the answer there are 5280 feet in a mile okay now no but that s not the answer that s not the answer can you please sit down this is feet i need to figure out how many yards so what can i divide this by to figure out how many yards are in a mile
3 why 3 because 3 feet are in a yard yes so i could take this i can divide it by 33 goes into 5 i m going to do no honey can you let me do this because i m trying to explain to everyone how to figure this out okay yards so i m taking this amount i m dividing it by 3
3 goes into 5 once i m doing division a crazy different way because it s quicker on hold on all right if i did 3 times 10 i m sorry 1000 right that would give me 3000
and if i subtract i would get 2280 which is what a lot of you thought something near that now i can t take another 1000 out but i know that 3 times 7 is 21 so 3 times 700 would be 2103 times 700 3 times 7 is 21 +2 zeros is 2100
2100 i said i couldn t it s close i cannot take another 1000 groups of 30 all right so then if i subtract again i get 180 180 so that would be 0 i can t extend
3 times 6 is 18 so 3 times 60 is 180 that would leave me with 0 so then if i add up i ve taken a total of 1760 groups of 3 so that s how many yards there are in a mile
1760 okay so group in the back you guys chose that one right turn so there are 1760 yards in a mile
all right group 2 group 2 which category and how much discussion metric for 5 points how much points metric for 5 points a kilogram woo we did this one a kilogram weighs about one £2 £3 £4
we so did this one we did it in small group and we reviewed it yesterday write your answer down on the board i want everyone writing their answer down on the board everyone should know this good job did everyone in your group get it
2.2 i like that most of you came in quietly
quietly i don t know if you remember but i m in the middle of being videotaped so i need you to get it together please excuse me can you sit down please
you can go to your seat and then just sit right there for me okay discussion yeah just go over there now
okay right i ll wait
quiet i want you to just scoot your chair over to this group no he didn t just noise stop making noise all right so s group said £2
the actual it s actually £2.2 is what a kilogram is equal to
pounds so you re being rude right now because you keep talking if on a test question and you re answer is 2.2 as long as you remember that a kilogram is close to £2 2.2 would be the answer to pick okay all right so your group gets 4 points
yes all right this group right here this group right here if you take too long . time out
group no one else should be discussing because there s nothing to discuss right quickly of time which i think it ends up being something else how many pounds are in 96 ounces i have to sit right there i can t see you can t see right now no because you re fine where you re at
place everyone should be figuring this out
really you could do repeated subtraction 0 that s a genius 0 i got it
it are you ready different you started out with the total ounces taking it away yes you already did that
wait yes okay are you ready group no get we didn t say anything i understand that i just said that we have to wrap it up
time thank you though stop what did you get
£66 is right and i want to show what and excuse me sit down please excuse me me i want to show you what and did
added 16s together until she got 96 so then she counted up how many total 16s she had and she had 6 16s together started with 96 ounces because that s how many total ounces there were he took 16 away each time so he did repeated subtraction she did repeated addition
and he then he counted up 1234 well he didn t finish but he would have finished he would have seen that got he took away 6 groups of 16 and if you checked yourself 16 times 6 would give you 96
points 44 okay we can i m not going to continue to talk over you right i m going to so we re going to get back to this after lunch
we re going to review multiplication and division of fractions and we got a couple of games that you re going to be working with that so do you want to be my guinea pig
a all right the rest of you will have your math journals go ahead you will have your math go ahead you got to go on the computer journal and we re going to practice multiplication of fractions
before you go hold on a minute here s what you re going to practice multiplying fractions
you have 3 fourths times 2 sevenths that will give you 3 fourths and here s how we re going to figure it out
numerators number 2 multiply the denominators and number 3 we re going to reduce the rest of you should be doing it on your math journals okay
okay anything that you can cancel or cross out or simplify well you could switch the 8 and the 10 you could 8 and 10 by 2 by 2 so what is half of 84 half of 10
you 8 times 2 gives you 16 and 5 times 9 fort 5 it gives you 4445 no
yeah 45 i thought you said 55 okay can i get some paper sure i ll give it to you thank you anybody done with it
no 1645s go to the board and do it
wait 8 tenths yes well and if you were to change this into a mixed number what do you get
yes 40 yeah 45 cause 4 +4 is 8 then add the one yeah can we simplify that no no okay hold on a minute can you simplify 32 and 45
rule is there a number that multiply by can we get half of 32 45 you can t get 45 because the number according to the divisibility rules the number must be even no because of the 50
3rd yes what number multiplied by 3 gives you 32 nothing nothing the divisibility rules 11 multiple of 3 okay 3432453245 yeah okay
out teacher m yeah erase
or 3 ninths okay so what is the 1st thing we should do
down check yes all right now take a look at you see where it says dividing go all right now we re just going to review dividing fractions
no it says change the 2nd fraction to it s reciprocal that multiply the 1st fraction by the reciprocal of the 2nd fraction do multiply reduce
example now you ve got mixed numbers in simplest form and you get 2 points start go ahead the rest of you should be doing it on your math journals
okay yes already simplify it
get write it down check yep computer i m taking my thing no yes okay what are we supposed to do
here if he s flipping it what are we missing the multiplication you re multiplying you re multiplying by it s reciprocal can you just wait you okay why do we get a 3 there okay where do you get that 3 from
huh so you simplify that number with what other number 3 and again you simplify that number with what other number the only reason or the only way that you can do that if you have another number be you simplify the 3 with what other number
it yes 6 yes 6 okay okay you should be doing it in your math journal sir what is the ninth part of 9 okay if you have a 9 and a 9 what is it
no switch each number no you re only supposed to switch the 2nd fraction okay
okay how did he get 33 eighths i mean 18th he got 18th on that one and some of you have 3 eighths okay what s the answer for this okay
yes yeah all right let s stop there
okay and again math come and you can practice a little division and a little . multiplication here s what you re going to do and i m going to give it to you in a minute game one of the problems that we ll notice or that i notice is that you guys are having a hard time with the equivalent of fractions
you ve got to be able to find the equivalent of fractions in order for you to subtract and do all this fraction cards each table is going to get this card bags you can play 2 people at a time or 3 people at a time
play and here s what you re going to do desk here s what you re going to do
please lay all the cards upside down and mix them up
noise you got to spread them out spread them out
come over here please and i need please you re going to play with him right here
d all right ready i m ready now if i were you i would kind of put them in a ray so that you can actually remember because this is a memory game but at the same time you ve got to pick the right equivalent fraction too
players will try to flip pairs of cards with equivalent fractions for example what is an equivalent fraction for 14th 2 eighths player one do i need to change your conduct sir no player one flips 2 cards if the cards match he or she gets to keep both cards
if the cards do not match then the cards are flipped back upside down do you understand that yes sir then player 2 gets a turn to try to get to flip the matching cards players alternate until all the cards have been removed from the game when the game is over the player with the most cards is the winner now whoever wins plays another person
understand yes all right let s do about let s get a couple of winners
t okay you got to find an equivalent fraction for 5 fifths then put them back
j okay then no you got to play 2 people 1st it what does it say fraction okay what s an equivalent fraction for 2 sixths 13rd okay see if you can have 13rd
is there another equivalent fraction for 2 sixths 13rd is there another equivalent fraction for that for 2 sixths what s the matter
see are they how do you go from 2 to 40 okay and how do you go from 7 to 14 you multiply so are they equivalent fractions okay you re right plus there s 2 okay
here you don t have a winner now
wow you keep moving them you can t keep doing that i already went
yeah it s just me and you the winner takes okay let s go go i don t see a winner yet
i m winning go her 2 fifths do we do just pairs
pairs the person that wins a pair goes to the next person right no we need to have a winner between the 2 of you but all the cards are gone well you re not done yet because you still have cards in there cards you keep picking the same one
i know that s the when i was here you did it same it s 114th yeah 2 tenths you got to figure out where the other numbers are
is that an equivalent yes 2 halves well this is a one and this is a one yes that s is that an equivalent this is the same okay 3 sevenths
that s 14th you re turn me yes okay we got about 4 minutes more i don t know you tell me
12 huh how do you go from 3 to 12 if you have you re saying that 3 sevenths is the same thing as 12 fourteenths how do you go from 3 to 124 and if you multiply by 4 you re going to get 28
0 so it should be 2 what if you multiply the next what is 7 and 127 times 12 what is 7 times 12 what is 12 times 784 okay what is 14 and 3
52 are they the same no so you can t say that 3 sevenths is the same as 12 fourteenths do they look the same okay is this a match you tell me
you have 2 twelfths and you have 6 eighths how do you go from 2 to 6 okay and if you multiply by 312 and 3 gives you 8 no okay if you multiply are they the same
what is 8 and 320 what is 12 and 6
okay one minute and the reason why you re doing reading is because there s no well maybe you can help out
out all right
guys if i have a half what would be an equivalent fraction for a half okay there it is now what is an equivalent fraction for 2 sixths 4 twelfths okay 13rd or one did i pass it
no it s not up there it is say 4 twelfths 4 twelfths or 13rd do we have 13rd
right put them in the bag please don t lose it quietly and then put them on my table
folder you can play with this at home and teach everybody else until you master your equivalent fractions
if i were you i would try to control myself because you re going to be in that red very soon right so we have been practicing multiplication here s a shorter way to do canceling fractions we have 4 fifths how many are we colored or how many are shaded
4 fifths okay then it says 2 thirds we re going to shade 2 thirds out of the 4 fifths one and 2 shade 2 thirds we shaded 2 so what did we end up with
okay if we were to write this down we have 2 thirds out of 4 fifths and this is going to be equal to 8 fifteenths anybody who has still got a problem with this okay so let s see if understands properly
we got 47th of 8 ninths come to the board and do it it show me that you understand how to do 4 sevenths of 8 ninths the rest of you should try to do it you should be doing it on your math journals
it can i do the next one okay why is it that you re not doing it it what is that
see to me that looks like a bunch of fractions without anything whatsoever is 8 ninths the same thing as 3263s what is the stands for one you got to do a multiplication sign
sign can we simplify 3263s no
okay the next thing they want to see is simplifying or canceling
simplify we can cancel a 7 from the 21 and the 35 and then it s so we have 21 and 35 you what does these 2 numbers have in common attention they both go into 7 they got the 3rd part of 21
7 times 3 is and 35 they got 7 times 57 times 5 okay no well you re going to 50 a part of one okay so you end up with 3 and one which is 3 and 50 and 5 which is 250
110 thirteenths and 2 fifteenths 0 can i do it me explain it to us please go to the board to the and do the same problem the rest of you work on your math journals
you got 10 thirteenths and 2 fifteenths simplify it or cancel before you start working on it
h simplify can you simplify anything i don t think you can simplify is it 10 twelfths or 10 thirteenths 10 thirteenths okay 225 can we simplify any numbers
yes what can we simplify or cancel what no because you have to go cross side you got to cross it 0 what 2 numbers can we cancel out
10 and say it again 10 and 10 and 15 what do they have in common 10 the 2 what is the 5th part of 153 now re write the fraction equals re write the fraction
what is 2 times 2
4 and what is 13 and 339 okay teacher m i got the answer we just said the answer there are no equal signs in here
no okay any questions about this thing let s take a look at this
step number one multiply the top numbers which are your numerators this if i can cancel out an x then you know there s nothing i can do about it so i just do what they tell me to do which is multiply the top numbers
step multiply the bottom numbers which are your denominators
step simplify the fraction as needed
please we multiply the numerators multiply the denominators okay what is 2 times one
2 if we cross them out or we cancel out what do we have here okay you can multiply what they re saying
well to me personally it s a lot easier to just cancel right away so i can work with the small numbers choice yes ma am could you go back to the top for a 2nd right there can t you like reverse 2 fifths and then you could cross why are you going to reverse dividing you only reverse when you re doing what
multiply divide dividing okay paper see this is what i m looking for you know you see me telling you all the time you got to have an equal sign
here what you re saying is that this thing is equals to this and this is equals to this and that s what i m expecting you to do if you don t put an equals sign i mean to me it looks like a bunch of fractions that you re putting in there okay yes and you notice also they don t put the equals sing on the numerator and the equals sign on the denominator you again to me it s preference
here to me it s a lot easier okay questions number 13rd times 9 sixths i mean 9 sixteenths to the board
no 13rd times 9 sixteenths here 13rd times 9 sixteenths is there a reason for you not doing this
teacher m i think i got this one wrong yes we did what number are we doing okay done yes
yes yours yes you re fine i can see that 9 nope you can simplify this where is it
0 simplify okay teacher m nope how can you simplify it what 2 numbers do you see that can be simplified or canceled 9 and 33 and 9 what is the 3rd part of 30
one okay what s the 3rd part of 93 okay so what is the new fraction which is 3 sixteenths again if you re write the whole fraction you will not have a problem
job good guys i just show you what they re asking you to do down it like 2 seconds to you do this in your head all the time
316 anybody else who still don t understand this sure yes okay
okay here is if you get the 1st 5 correct you get to help out your classmates them so we got the harder ones
bigger ah bigger i ll make it bigger did i say let s make all this noise
did i say make all this noise i still hear too much talking
0 that s big okay there is your 1st 5 that s nice it doesn t require all this talking
those 6789 and 109 and 100
0 this is right
yes can you 2 this 3 and this 1212 okay so you end up with 7 fourths times 18th what is 7 and one
78 and 4 what is 8 times 4 you got the table right there
fine do not give the answers explain how to do it number 816th and 3 sevenths what is the 3rd part of 31 what is the 3rd part of 6
2 so you put 30 okay fix that let me see
4 times 8 okay good help out out help out yeah whoever needs help help
nope help check help out
check okay okay got okay you need help help okay you need to help somebody nope
check help him out check
7 and 8 and 432 so do you this is right 0 what is the 3rd part of 31 what is the 3rd part of 62 okay so you end up with one half times 17th and it s one fourteenths which is okay one yes
help i got no say i do that i checked it yes i i put it at can i go help yes yes okay
it do i go help now that did you understand how to do it right the 3rd part of 3 is 3 the 3rd part of 3 is one so you end up with 21 times 15th 2 and one is 2 and 5 you got 6 fifteenths this is not right
can i help check yes can i help okay anybody who still do not understand how to do this i don t i m asking for help i always need help but explain figure out how to explain it to her okay good all right can i get 5 you still don t get it
he needs help the rest of you can yes
okay what is it that we don t get hardest simplifying okay problem 6 tell me the numbers
07 twelfths 3 eighths 7 twelfths times 3 eighths 3 eighths this is this is how i do it
it all right shh okay this is how we do it it all right i only know the 1st line can i do the whole thing if i know my times tables and i look at these numbers i see something that basically calls my attention
it 3 and 12 the 3 and the 12 so this is what i say one or what is the 3rd part of 124 what is it me or you can say what is 3 divided by 31 what is 3 divided by 124 why am i picking 3
well because the divisibility rules 3 can go into 124 times or because of that too attention so i m going to re write this fraction
fraction well re write it as 7 fourths times 18th now i got smaller numbers
432 can i simplify that
me do you get it okay shh shh no this i mean there s no other question because i m going to give a quiz real quick i expect everybody let her do it here you do it there here use this one
all right do 16th 16th times 3 sevenths 16th times 3 sevenths now if you look at those numbers do you see anything in there that probably looks yes what is it okay can you simplify the 3 and the 6
yes okay if you divide 3 by 3 what do you get one now if you do this if you do that to this number you got to do it to the other number number so what is 6 divided by 32 okay cross it and 2 re write the fraction
equals one half times numerators multiply the denominators done how was it
now okay you just got to practice okay 5 questions easy 111121314155 questions it you can simplify or cancel in between or you can just wait until the end and simplify it
5 questions show me the work easy 100 voices should be off
put your name on it
is all right class we re going to go ahead and continue our work with fractions today and i have several fractions on the board i have a feeling that every one of you should be able to put those in order from the smallest to the greatest
easy why don t you write those in your notebook real quick in order start with the smallest and get to the largest see 0 i didn t write it down
what we re going to stop talking like that to each other enough i m so glad that some of you are ready and have it written down as well excellent what did you write down smallest 4 twelfths 4 twelfths in the smallest that why do you think it s the smallest
because the smaller the because the denominator is smallest well 12 is pretty big
good and since all of these have a numerator of 4 we really only need to look at the denominator to be able to tell which one is going to be the smallest j the 4 ninths 4 ninths because it has small pieces it has smaller pieces too larger than the twelfths but smaller than the others
that 4 sevenths 4 sevenths because 4 sevenths pieces are what are smaller pieces than 4 sixths they re smaller than 4 sixths very good i thought you were going to say smaller than 4 ninths but you turned it around for me good they are smaller than 4 sixths so then it would go in this order
broke 4 sevenths has bigger pieces than 4 ninths 4 sevenths has bigger pieces exactly that s why i was afraid you were going to say it backwards but you didn t job today we re going to take what you already know about fractions and we already have a little bit of a background in fractions because we ve been doing a lot with calendar math but today we re going to actually learn to do some simplifying
so we re going to start simplifying fractions officially and in order to get ready to do this what i d like you to do i want you to listen carefully before you grab anything back in your baskets there s going to be a number line strip basically all i need from you is to simply cut it in half
anywhere so you re simply going to cut it like this right down the middle then you re going to line it up and you re going to glue the 11 on top of that tab right here like that so that you have kind of like a number line it does kind of look like a ruler exactly
long so please go ahead and take care of that right now yes ma am scissors you may have extras
okay yeah that s exactly right done now glue them together and put the scissors back
anymore what are you doing didn t you watch me
what happened sorry you re doing 2 at a time that s okay here you go put those together unless somebody else has a set too just in case now we ve got a separate all done
long now please make sure you re looking at it before you glue it together because you certainly don t want to glue half of it upside down do you remember
go now glue it together no basket all glue should be back in the basket as well 321 thank you much better
you i was very clear that you simply cut down the middle right this you said there s supposed to be now why do i hear you saying eww please stop your nonsense
follow directions all right the next thing in your basket is that there are some little baggies that have red and yellow chips on them i d like each of you to take a baggies please and you don t need to fuss over it
baggie your strips should be laid across your desk and they should be laying flat
desk there we go top all scissors and glue should be put away at this time all right what we re going to do today is i m going to show you a little bit on how to use these
no exactly so i need you to look up here desk you don t have to play with them so i shouldn t hear any of the ruffling out of the plastic baggie today like i said we re going to be looking at simplifying fractions
you will know that a fraction will be in their simplest form when the numerator and the denominator have only one as their common factor we ve seen this with calendar math and this is an example 5 ninths the only factors that they have in common the factors for 5 are one and 5
9 the only thing that they have in common is one form you can t get any smaller numbers than that okay and it s still equal to that so today we can go and reduce fractions or turn them into their simplest form by 1st listing all of the factors for the numerator and the denominators
example here i have 6 twelfths my factors for 6 are one 2 3 and 6 my factors for 12 are one 2 3 4 6 and 12 familiar yes a little when did we do anything like this
right so now we have all of our factors listed we so now that we have the one circled the next things we re going to do is find which one is the greatest that they have in common and that s called of course the greatest common factor
and the one that they both have in common the largest number that they have in common is the 6 now this is the number that we are going to use to simplify 612th and this is how we do it we re going to use the greatest common factor and we re going to express it as the whole number one then we will divide the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common factor
so when we are dividing by one let s back up a minute one times any number is going to give you that same number isn t it yes so that number divided by one will also give you the same number won t it yes so it doesn t change the value of a number one we re just going to use simpler numbers instead of using huge numbers
6 so 6 divided by 6 equals one and 12 divided by 6 equals 2 therefore these 2 numbers 6 twelfths and one half are equal equivalent fractions we call them okay 6 twelfths simplified is the same as one half yes
i think it was last night s homework there were some fractions that were one part of like it was one part away from the whole 0 it was so you recognized those excellent very good i m so glad to hear that you were really applying what we learned in class
j how did you make it half of okay quick when we listed all their factors factors are one times 6 is 6 6 one times 12 is 12
12 so these are all the factors for 12 common see they both have a one 6s that s the number that we use to divide 6 over 6
we make it into a one whole can you go back again yes factors i m sorry say that again
isn t 12 and 6 factors because nothing times 12 will equal 6 numbers okay so then that s what we used was the 6 because it was the greatest common factor
so 6 divided by 6 is one and 12 divided by 6 is 21 half they re equal okay today the 1st fraction that we re going to work on is going to be 4 twelfths and now we re going to get to use our chips and our number lines works you re going to mark the factors for the numerator in yellow
so who can tell me what are the factors that we get when we re trying to make the number 4 j not multiples 41 so our factors right now are one and 4
2 exactly so this is how i m going to mark it in yellow 2 sided so you want to turn it on the yellow side and you want to put it above the numbers one 2 and 4
number so you don t have to go like that cause then you might get a little confused okay there we go just like that okay next i want to know what are the factors for 12
120 my goodness i ran out
it all right so you said one 2 3 4 6 and 12 anything no
she switched it over all right now i d like you to do the same of course so which numbers do they both have in common place okay what do they both have in common
one 2 and 4 good one 2 and 4 are the numbers they have in common you are not going to mark your paper because then they ll be marked forever there can you see with your chips on there what are the common factors can so which one is the greatest common factor
k 4 the 4
do you re going to write 4 twelfths and then you re going to put divided by and then i want you to write 4 fourths but what i want you to do with that is you re going to make a number one out of it like this
i want you to remember really what we re dividing by is one whole equivalent they re going to be equal because we re really dividing by one we re just using the factors of 4 and 44 over 4 which equals one to do our division now let s go ahead and divide please 4 divided by 4 is one and 12 divided by 4 is
3 so if i said what is 4 twelfths simplified you would say 13rd 13rd now this is the other thing i want you to write in your notebooks please i want you to write your arrows like this i want you to show an equal sign to show that they re equal if you d like
but then even more importantly i want you to write the word simplified because i want you to remember if i ask you to simplify something i m asking you to make the numbers look smaller even though it s going to be an equivalent fraction now you can t no smaller than correct how do you know that
because 13rd is the smallest when it s simplified for 4 twelfths and what did we say at the beginning if the numbers only have what as their only common factor if one is their only common factor then you know that it is as simple as it can get example you can move your chips off of your chart
and now we re going to go ahead and do the same idea with 6 eighteenths write your fraction in your notebook please raise your hand if you can tell me what are the factors for 6
6 i want to go ahead and clone that right away now can you give me the factors for 18 please 18 it would be one 8 and one 8 and 2
anything else 6 3 18 i thought i cloned this i thought it was on the top i know
too 18 go i thought he said 8 9 you didn t say 8 you so one times 18 is 18 did you
j 2 times 9 is 18 and 3 times 6 is 18 common thank you for raising your hand lot all right what do they have in common in common that they both have the 6
i don t see your chips 6 isn t the only thing they have in common though i said what do they have in common they both have if you times it like one 2 3 6
very good they both have one 2 3 and 6 as their common factors 6 so we ll go ahead and divide by 6 sixths
please write this in your notebook and please make sure you outline it as a number one and when you do the math get 13rd 13rd good 6 divided by 6 is one 18 divided by 6 is 3
equal and what s the other word that i need you to say simplified is this pretty easy so when we were doing calendar math and i said you guys have got to start paying attention to this because we re going to use it later i took notes it looks like you guys were paying attention
now i m so glad calendar this is a whole lot easier excuse me j you had it all figured out
i did these 2 and except i only did 3 and i m so glad you mentioned that okay guys everybody look up her for a minute what you did is you did simplify it you just didn t simplify it to its smallest possible number
you is it okay if i share because i bet you some other people are thinking the same thing minute what did is she recognized right away that 3 was something that both of these numbers had in common
what i m going to go ahead and divide by 3 thirds and there s kind of nothing wrong with that because that is also equal to one whole right and when you divide you get 2 and 6 so that s 2 sixths that is definitely simpler
equal but when i say i m looking for it simplified they re also going to say simplified to the lowest terms wouldn t that be so here s what i want you to write
simplified yeah i want you to add to lowest terms because what did is simplify well it s not wrong but it s not complete
so wouldn t that be a question that they may ask you what is the greatest common factor they could ask you to simplify it to the lowest terms and yes the answer is still going to be 13rd but i wanted to show you this halfway step
halfway this is not completely simplified to the smallest possible terms 21 and 21 and 2 3 one 2 3 and 6
common so now you would have to take 2 sixths and do it again divide it by 2 halves which is equal to one
3 so even though it s 6 eighteenths you could still do it you could still get it smaller using other common denominators but it won t be the smallest possible so that s why we want to use the largest common denominator so that we can get it to be the smallest possible simplest terms fraction
so what i was trying to say is you weren t wrong you just weren t finished so that s why we want to use the largest common denominator the greatest common factor rather okay yes ma am has there ever been something that you could divide by 10
p i would really like you to take your chips and put those in the bag if you don t mind news what i want you to do is go ahead and draw your line
i want you to write your fraction 720 eighths i want you to use your strips to put your chips on there to show all the factors for 7 and all the factors for 28 and i need to have it written in your notebook please thank you so much glad is it in your notebook or is it just in your head
no it s in my notebook 0 wow 7 is a prime number you can t divide excuse me again 7 is a prime yes it is prime but that s not what we re asking work i like the way i see using her chips correctly
28 how are we supposed to do this good question you don t really need it what just take your chip and stick it over here on the edge and know that that s a 287 does not have 28 as a factor so you know it s not going to have that in common
it just put it out there on the edge you got it almost what are your factors for 7
here nice job 70 7 and 28 great now what are the factors for 28
2 times what will give you 28 14 you re not wrong so far here 2 times 14 is right
28 right so you need a chip under 4 7 they have a 7 divide all right factors for 7 please
7 factors for 28 please 28 one 2 4 7 14 and 28 out there somewhere so what do they have in common what s the greatest common factor
7 so we re going to write that as 7 sevenths 7 divided by 7 is one 28 divided by 7 is 4 4 all right
now what are we going to write on here now else she said you can use both but it doesn t have anything in common
okay that s how we re using that 4 over here don t get upset okay just remember to use your chips j you want to pull up your pants and pull your shirt down up it looks like i need to make you a belt yeah i do
do i don t want to see your underwear please thank you 0 my goodness i am so happy with
what to the lowest term to the lowest terms that s okay minute is that another comment i m hearing out of your mouth
is all right this one is a little trickier that s now my favorite color too clear off your chips and please go ahead and put your new factors on yellow ones at the top 8 come on
well it s all right what s the matter him it you dropped one of your chips on the ground 0 you sure did
one times 8 is remember put them at the same time what good now let s try 26
red i think 2 should work there too
be who me
and then it will be another fraction fraction let s wait and see what the fraction is 1st and then we ll know more when we do that okay
good now what do they have in common 3
common is there a 2 2 that s not very big is it but that s all they have in common number so we re going to go ahead and divide that by 2 over 2 you already figured that out
go that s the answer you got it 4 one 2 and 4 here one 2 4 and 8
you factors for 26 please one times 26 it okay so our greatest common factor here is 2
2 so we re going to go ahead and divide by 2 halves which is equal to 11 whole divided by 2 is 4 26 divided by 2 is 13
so once again we have our equivalent fractions and they are simplified what somebody else asked me the same question and that s a very good question because it looks like it has some really big numbers doesn t it
minute we said that we know it s simplified to the smallest number if they don t have any other common factors on if the only thing they have in common when you list their factors is a one then you can t simplify it anymore 4
good what are the factors for 13 13 the only thing they have in common is one mean it can t go any lower it can t get any smaller it is as simple as it s going to get
all right the last one and then we have some individual things for you to do easy i know
it i don t see this one on your paper yet
you know what this is a couple times i ve heard something about you now i d like you to please be nice and not make so many comments okay 2 times what will give you 9
why are you looking at mine 3 times what is going to give you that 15 now
wait 2 times will give you 9
that then 3 times 5 gives you that 15 right 3 and you have your answer in there you know what
if you can think of them in terms of multiplication because you can do multiplication right so you just ask yourself 3 times what will equal okay so if you kind of do it that way then you can probably get them so we re doing 9
there now put those at the top so you know that there s a numerator 3 times what 3 times 3 15 can you multiply anything by 2
15 nothing nothing how about 3 3 times anything no that s not so that s 3 and 5
3 okay that s what you re going to use all right why don t you tell us what you got when you figured this all out yes only 5 people 67 raise your hand if you agree 3 fifths good even is agreeing 3 fifths she says is the final answer
fantastic so when we listed our common factors the greatest common factor was 3 so we used that as 3 thirds and of course that gives us our 3 fifths now here s what i need you to do in your notebooks i want you to be on a blank sheet of paper basically
row you re going to try to skip every other line and instead of numbering from one to whatever instead i want you to label it from a skip a line b skip a line c and you re going to keep on going if you run out of room kind of divide your paper in half and come up here to the next column and you want to keep labeling until the letter r
that s a lot of letters that s a lot of letters
estimate and the number is 2842s so i m going to go ahead and write it i m going to use my strips with my chips to do my factors factor i do not know what it is but i m going to go ahead and divide by whatever it is and then i want you to go ahead and write what the simplified version of that number would be
do we have to do all of them now because there are a bunch of them i want you to do as many as you can so what i m going to do is i m going to put these in the middle of a group of students for example i would like you 4 to work together so these are going to go here you re simply going to take a card here s the letter e for here s j for l for
see then we have b for out so you re simply going to take the one that you have go to that letter write your number simplify it put it back when you re done
and you re simply going to pass the cards around until you ve gotten as many as you can possibly finish t it s okay you have to get through a b c d all the way through r anyway okay i changed my groups a little bit okay
actually we do have one 2 3 4 5 in this group all right so all 6 of you are pulling from this pile sorry so here s your pile
with all right the 4 of you are going to work together pile the 3 of you are going to work together so here is your pile
please move the water onto the ground in case it were to flip over then we have a group of 5 over there why don t you come on over here and work at this table this way it will lighten the numbers so there won t be so many trying to get cards at the same time
well they re sealed isn t that ones from the cafeteria yeah it it ll be okay i won t worry about it until tomorrow
i think it ll be okay yes yes you re going to do exactly the same thing
there is something now do the denominator 28
sweetheart just put it back and get another one
no you don t get to do them in order okay this doesn t work that way yeah what do you have but it doesn t equal 11 yeah i know that s 2 thirds equals see that s the answer this is the answer
yeah and this also equals one no wait wait no sweetie no no that s 3 wait hold on what was the answer okay so this is 3 thirds right okay that s better that s not equal to one is it
okay yeah i just hit my funny bone that s why okay this is hard so now you re asking yourself 3 divided by 3 is equal to what or you re saying what times 3 is equal to 3
right so that goes at the bottom so you re kind of working it backwards nice i like how you recognized that it wasn t completely simplified what s that why did you put one on top of 14
8 can you multiply 14 times something to get 8 far now what could you multiply by 14 to get 28 here this goes the other way cause these are the denominators
2 let s try 3 no how about 4
yes good 4 times 7 okay now what what do they have in common 4 4 so that s the number that you re going to use to divide okay
are nice 9 divided by 9 what s that i said very nice yes
i don t get that number i get this number but i don t what are the factors for 39
no that s the problem that s the problem okay i didn t know i thought she was just coming over here coming over here like she did yesterday okay 33 okay and 9 is one
you didn t finish though what else for 33 2 teacher now in order for it to be divisible by 2 it has to have an even number at the end
you can i ask you something yes how come you re not writing down any of these factors or putting a chip on them sorry so if you re trying to figure out if 33 is divisible you do this how do you know the cards
11 put your chips on there please 11 can you divide it by 4
that i forgot if multiples for the number that we re dividing by 0 we didn t actually write it down is yeah was this a multiple of 9 or was that a factor of 9
here 16 which would be one times 16 6 i do not think so
400 lordy so you would do one times 40
so that one just kind of goes off the page okay it s 8 tenths divided by 2 tenths that s right okay
so now what you re asking yourself is what times 2 equals 8 top and then you re asking yourself what times 2 equals 10 5 so you re working backwards there we go
8 so that s what you re going to use so this is letter e
i have a question on the board for you and i want you to copy the question on which paper please don t do that
that s easy write it down i want you to copy that problem that question and then i want you to show me your answer please i know it that s all right we can continue tomorrow but it s time for us to finish up math okay copy your question and then write out i do not want you to raise your hand and tell me the answer
i want you to write directions for yourself really is what i want you to do me we went all the way up to r
sure write the question and then write out the answer step yes
e said do you want me to stop what i m doing and do this and the answer is yes stop what you re doing because we will continue with math tomorrow and we will do some more simplifying but for right now i want you to stop and answer that question
it now have you written out an explanation yet mean it s just exactly what you ve been doing what did we do
did multiply and that gets 9 called multiples factors yeah factors so the 1st step is i list the factors eww i just bit into it let s talk about what directions you re going to write what do you mean you solved it already
it so basically i don t want you to forget it did 1st i used the strip to do what right write that down number 11st list all the factors oops write it out
did you write it out yes good very nice okay 1st we list all the factors out then we put we did what put the checklist up there huh you don t have to write the checklist do you
it so we found which ones were the highest the highest one that they had in common right so we found the highest one they had in common
10 that s what i thought i got my answer you need it in words step one step 2 it did i ask you to solve it
question the question is how do you simplify it do you must write out the directions
that s fine close that s good yeah it s really close really close all right good number when you found the common factor what did you do simplified well how did you simplify by dividing dividing it right
all right can you grab that pen for me please let me see that would be your numerator and denominator then you would write that s really good
proud nice go i did horrible at it last year did you
wow all right for those of you who are having trouble the reason i want you to do this is so that when you go home tonight and you look at your homework and i ve asked you to try to simplify something you won t have forgotten what we did today it ll be right there in your notebook and it ll be in your words
raise your hand if you can tell me what is the 1st step for you to simplify good list all factors excuse me of both numbers
okay what s the 2nd thing we re going to do j find the highest common factor good now we re going to find the highest common factor
great and another word for that is gcf which really stands for greatest common factor but it means the same thing as highest n i put write out the problem okay but we re going to write okay
write i do not know what kind of problem to write am i going to put i do not know 3 +3 equals 6 he said division 0 a division problem right so i m going to write the fraction divided by what
the gcf the gcf written as see cause if you told me that this is what i would do watch is that really what we did
no so we wrote the gcf as a whole number one good divided by the gcf as a whole number one
and here s an example would be 3 thirds there s an example then once you divided once you wrote the fraction what did you do it solve and that gives you the number right
okay solve and you have the simplified fraction all right great job
right yep what did you get when you took 9 twenthy 7th and simplified it everybody 13rd all right
please go ahead and take your card pieces the ones that have letters a through r and put them in a nice neat pile i need one person from each group to return those to me these cards these strips stop and put your name on the back it would you go down to the room these cards these strips stop and put your name on the back fold it in half and put it in your notebook so you can use it tonight if you need it
would you go down to the room the lounge the teacher lounge and knock on the door to get miss j so that she can come and get the videotape do you where that is
well the way you can tell for sure is what are the factors of 2 9 so the only thing they have in common is one so that means it s as simple as it s going to get
and where do you think the chips are supposed to go me no who brought me these cards in a bag
who did i never gave anybody a set of cards in a bag
girls as you are doing your network i want to talk to you about your objectives for today
you got it sweetheart our objectives for math today eyes up here so you know students will be able to shade half or 14th of a 4 by 6 array by the end of today you are going to be doing that and you need to explain to me what 14th is today your network is the story problem here
you do not need to copy the story problem but you need to solve it and explain you will notice on the bottom i wrote are you listening to me i wrote show you how know draw some sort of picture or diagram or representation or number sentence some way i know you understand how to show what half is
timer i am going to give you 4 minutes to do that started what is up do we need to copy it down
that if you don t believe me it is recorded on the camera
you do not need to copy the story problem if you ever do i will write copy the story problem but for today for right now you are going to sit at the round table
faces it is a great answer
okay ms
free we have 16 cookies cookies how many cookies will you have
you have 16 cookies can you write that number please do minus not minus that is a good guess though let us do this let us draw is mouth and ms mouth that is my mouth
belly let us draw one cookie for one for ms 2 we need to get to 16 finish go to 16 and we will see how many go to and how many go to ms r keep on going
you 16 math problems i am going to do half of them on monday and half of them on tuesday problems half of 16
wrote yes get our time is up for now 8 so what is half of 16
8 so can you write that please half of 16 is 8 that let us take a minute and talk about this we had 16 math problems and you only wanted to do half of them on monday and half of them on tuesday 16 loud and proud please
sentence 8 problems is one half how many problems is half half so he says that 8 equals one half of 16
or one half of 16 equals 8 same who can prove it to me what if we had a 2nd grader in the classroom and they said they do not know how to do half of 16 hello 4th graders wake up
out 16 is 28s can you show me 28s this is 28s right here and then one of these is half so what you are saying i think is 28s 8 and 8 equals 16
so can we say 8 +8 equals 16 c 16 divided by 2 another way to do it is 16 divided by 2 equals 8 and that is what you had is not it number does anyone have some sort of picture that shows it
picture you can come up and show us also sorry you are going to have to do some talking here 8 +8 is 16 we have got 8 over here and 8 over here and this is half
you somebody have a different picture representation to show us do you did a lot of different interesting if you do not mind me using your notebook honey added more equations and she has 8 +8 is 16
she also has 16 -8 equals 8 and 8 times 2 lots of equations that show what half of 16 is okay did anyone chose to make an array
nobody i do not think you have an array can you talk your hand away from your mouth i can not hear you you are right no i said sometimes some people might mix that up
you is saying we know 4 times 4 is 16 so some people might say 4 is half of 16 this this is an array it is 2 by 8 equals 16
a so if i am saying this represents my math problem yes arrays so what you can do is we can say half of them would be like this
i am going to shade half of them would you agree that half of them are shaded and half of them are not shaded yes and does everyone recognize that word when i show it to you again
shaded what is another word a synonym for shaded
do you finish what i was going to do mind good job do you remember this
move you do not remember that before let us switch gears right now still talking about fractions and still talking about half but now we are going to talk about a different array
sorry i thought you were looking at my knees or something or looking down who can tell me what are the dimensions of these arrays you the dimension of this array is 2 times 4
array i will move out of the way so you can see you so we have got a 4 by 6 array
answer we have to change them around a little bit i want to pretend now that this this is a sandwich h we are each going to get half of the sandwich half
i can not hear you i still can not hear you and i am only this far away
louder i think i know what you are saying are you saying i can cut the sandwich vertically or horizontally
okay so she is saying i can cut the sandwich vertically and can you tell me where to stop where i should make the cut okay so she is saying to make the cut right here so i am going to color in or just shade in ms
ms h is going to get it is a blueberry sandwich would everyone agree that is half of the sandwich good so we know that this is i will do it right over here this is half and this is half
yes you could do 3 3 and 3 3 it all equals 12 out good
can you please open up your books to page one unit 6 what do you need come up here and show me what you need we are moving on you took your unit test yesterday so we are starting a new unit
stop not quite try again use the eraser page can you use your pencil please and instead of cutting the sandwich i am sorry was this vertically or horizontally
vertically instead of cutting it vertically can you cut it in half and shade half of it horizontally any sandwich
exactly have you ever heard anybody talking about the horizon the horizon is when there are no buildings in the way and you can see as far as the eye can see as far as you can look and where the sky looks like it is touching the land can you picture what i am saying have you ever been anywhere where you can look and there is no buildings or houses to stop you and you can see until what is that
in the science room in the science room you can see that well anytime you can see the sky touching the land that is called the horizon this that is a good way to remember horizon horizontal i do not know if that is going to be helpful if you do not know what a horizon is
book it is not 18 that is not the answer i like that you know where to find information though
please you are going to solve that problem figure out that answer
i have seen kids either color the top part above the horizontal line or the bottom part below the horizontal line correct can you raise your hand without saying my name yes yes i asked you to cut it horizontally
is it like that just do 11 and no more do not do anymore it looks to me like we have handled half just fine half what happens if ms
us now i have got ms ms h and me 4 thank you
now the pieces are no longer called halves like this anymore if we are cutting them into 4 pieces do you know what we are calling them now fourths very good fourths and fourths is pronounced like this
fourths not 4s but fourths and an easy way to remember this is what grade are we in 4th there we go and i like to tell kids this is the only time you are ever allowed to stick your tongue out at me to say 4th and then you can stick your tongue out at me
can you show me on another sandwich can you please split it up into fourths show me how to split it into fourths
now i am going to get you crayons and what i am going to ask you to do interesting make that work and prove to me that it does what i am going to ask you to do is color in each 4th a different color
work i want you to cut the sandwich divide the sandwich and color in the 4 different parts
pieces there is a lot of different ways to do it can i sit on the floor no 4 pieces so they are all the same and that is the thing where did you make it into 4 pieces
pieces here you go i want you to i am not sure what you are doing i am asking you for 4 people that is all i have asked you for and you 2 need to work together if you don t have a book
is it like that here you can make 2 of them white and 2 of them blue
white the camera sees blue really well but it does not see other colors no so i am noticing that some kids have something can you color it darker please do you know what darker means that is darker
good i am seeing that some kids have what looks like what has up here okay you said different colors yes but the camera only sees blue and black so we are only going to be using blue and black or white up here colors i want to be able to see your different spots
right this is cut into i guess we can label each of them like this this does anyone have one that looks different than this
different you can use blue black there you go
did great
i am going to ask you to color this one in blue and this one in blue and keep those in white just so the camera can see it really well different why did not you try to make that other one work
good that one is half piece how can you make it into 4 pieces i do not see 4 pieces on yours yet either
in nice boys 4 pieces very nice c very good does anybody have a different 11 that looks different from these that one you have is this 4 that is the one you have
different that is this one again i do not see it there me has something really interesting i do not know if she is right or wrong
me as is drawing you can finish coloring in and then you are going to put your crayons down and give me your attention ruler yes
heat can you start bringing a sweatshirt to school please we have talked about this for a long time change interesting half i am sorry fourths
it yeah maybe the 2 opposing ones can be can i do more than just one no because we are going to put our pencils down i am going to color them a little bit more just to make sure that everyone can see okay
yet you can explain to us how you know if this is right or not take a look at what did i am waiting for 2 people to put their crayons down 4 pieces it is 4 pieces one 2 3 4
out let us give our attention one 2 3 4 5 pieces you need something with just 4 pieces let us come back to this in a minute come take your seat because it seems like some of us are missing how to just make 4 pieces
so if i want to share this sandwich so 4 people can have a piece of it put it down who can explain to me why 4 people will be able to share this
happy i am going to circle it so everyone knows which one i am talking about say who can explain to me why will all 4 people be satisfied with the piece of that sandwich they are getting if you are going to explain it has got to be in a loud voice
go because it is equal yes equal that is such an important word when we are talking about fractions that i am going to put it up here m
j the same the same equal means the same we lost our l there same so when we are talking about fractions all the pieces have to be equal or be the same
would you all agree that this is the same as this and this and this except for the color same everyone in here should be able to answer this question
how can you prove to me how can you make me believe that this piece here is the same size as this piece here
i am going to wait until everybody can prove it to me because this is a really easy question hands before you raise your hand it looks like some of your friends are not sure maybe the words to explain
you what is that
i will still have what i want to know how do we know for sure that the pieces colored in blue are the same as the pieces colored in white
we are not moving on until everybody can tell me that this is the same as that table that is the key i see everyone over here with their hands up everyone over here
goodness i was seriously getting nervous here that we did not know but look at all of these hands sure you could measure it m count the squares that how many squares are in each piece of the sandwich
6 let us see for sure 6 is it safe to say is it true that 14th of 24 equals 6
2414th of it is 6 pieces
f please stop tapping if we know for sure that there is 6 here there is 6 here and 6 here that is how we know we are all the same mister t complaining my piece is too small no it is not mister t
else is who can explain to me over here whiteout come sit down please who can explain to me over here here raise your hand and tell me yes or no and why
p they are all the same size equally interesting
size how do you know prove it that put your marker down
coloring thank you i was going to say it is 2 2 2 and are you saying right here is 2 2 and 20 this is 2 2 this one 2 one 2 it and total it is 6
0 so is saying and i like this is saying mister 6 so once again are we saying that 14th of 24 equals 6
again yes okay so then what about this this if 6 pieces is the key as long as everyone gets 6 pieces that are touching i can not have 2 over there and 2 over there
touching so if i do one 2 3 4 5 6 can you color that in on yours in 12nd next show me on yours
up you can put it over there can you show it over here here the only reason i can not have you up here is your grandma did not give me permission to have you on the video camera sorry they will just have to imagine how adorable you are it is messed up
about we love making mistakes in here because it means we are trying to learn there has a question what is up i love that you are getting her to think job use a ruler and then check that out
that go 12nd do it again count we know that is not one full one is it
one this is not full though so let us count how many full ones what if we moved is it half
okay interesting what about this one back go to your seat and raise your hand
colors they need to be touching not just the corners and i asked you to do that up can you color the rest in in 4 different colors
me can you color the one i have on the board right now 4 different colors you are going to have to go over orange in a different color because i asked for 4 different colors
color the way i have it on the board it erase this please use 4 different colors
interesting then we will be you are saying that these are bigger than that is what you think interesting okay
do you agree with this let us try this is that side the same as this side here that is the half that way interesting okay
so then if we cut it this way you are saying that is now you are saying is this half the same as this half but those are not the same right there
why let me come back to you okay this you should have 4 different colors right now and you should have it colored in the way i have it on the board and continue splitting it so there is 4 different pieces
board i do not think they are the same same do not erase it again there is 2 colored in here and 4 colored in there and that is not the same
touching i am getting really bothered that i am saying the same thing over and over again and it is fascinating to me that my english speakers are not understanding me again let us do this together please great start
now we have got going on up here one piece eyes up here please we know that this is 14th because it is one 2 3 4 5 6
anytime i am coloring in 6 squares that are touching that are together we know that that is the same as 14th see i asked you to use 4 different colors to show me
put it down that is not what i asked you to do
6 is that the same amount as this p it is the same amount because we colored in 6
6 they are equal because they both have colored in 6 me i need to color in how many for ms fair i can do that wherever i want
a so one 2 3 4 5 6 no why not because the other one it is different 0 the shape is different this shape is different than this
f yeah because it equals the brown equals 6 the blue equals 60 so even if they look different put it down
even if they look different it is the same amount inside it is the same way of saying this is 6 markers 6 yes yes is this 6 markers
6 it is the same amount and the same goes with our picture up here happy i would like you to color in the blue i have here
use i want to see an l on your paper now please make an l color in 6 and you do it any way you want as long as they are touching and they are equal
j please do you we know that this right here how many is on this side do we know what is half of 24
12 so we know there is going to be 12 over here and 12 over here when i am talking about this now how do i cut this section right here here how do we cut this in half over here
again so you are saying this side over here is smaller than this side over here so the dimension with 4 is smaller than the dimension with 6 okay what i am wondering is if we are cutting it like this we have got 12 over here
6 you are saying that this is not the same as this we have got let us see one 2 3 4 one 2 3 and now we need to find this right here how about this right here
no sort of huh there then we have got maybe 4 and 4 is that good then 5 and 56 and 0 and that right there 6
6 over here we have got one 2 you like that this looks too these 2 are too big
this can we do 3 and 3 you think that is good then 4 and 45 and maybe just a little bit of this 5 and 5 and we have got 6 so we are missing this amount right here
6 it would have to be 6 and where is that missing piece side it can not be because this one right here is going to be the same and the same right here let us see
if we know we have 6 right here then we are going to have 6 right here
12 we are running out of time
you this is good this is fun right there is 6 right there good i asked you to copy what i had minutes i am seeing kids have copied what i have here
great can you think of a different way to color in 6 of them us you did not finish i want to see 4 colors color good
it do 4 colors
no i like that she is going through it quickly because she knows this is not art class same very nice
good let us see what she does differently now
it i am going to ask that by the end of math you have completed the page and come up with different ways to divide your arrays into fourths that is great finish 4 colors
colors thank you done would everybody be satisfied with their pieces
equal i can not hear you it i will make another one for you once you are finished this is not art class so get it done quickly
your whole page you need to have different ways you have divided them into fourths me does there need to be 6 if it is fourths great do has got a really smart one i do not know you tell me
is this right 6 how many is here whoa you need to fix that do not you interesting take a look at is are these equal
yes why because they have 6 in each very nice
6 that is a great one really nice i did the l too i did not even see that one
right good good made good do i did this one and this one i know very nice
them can you stick with not cutting them in half please draw along the lines for now yet maybe what i want you to do 2 more
done very nice nice i do not know until i see 4 colors no they have to be touching just like i told you for this one count the sides need to be touching can i do this
sure over here that is 6 and there is 6 right here and one 2 3 4 5 6 great and you guys should be done
one i know but i did these 4 and now you have to do these 4 i did this this and this 4 yes you need to draw some more though let me draw some more up here i think i have got room for 2 more
can you stick with using these 3 colors in white done i would hate for you to miss class game time because you can not get it done that is a really good one
yes i like that one has anyone done that one up here here you do yours up here fine when is finished you need to get 3 more done
saying nice very good that is a good one too before has a really cool one that bottom left learn you tell me if it is right
yes let me see that can be 6 no one 2 3 you have got to get a move on
do one 2 3 4 5 6 and leave these 3 that sounds great to me and when you say leave these 3 you mean have them be white
piece yeah yes honey if i make you think if you make mom crazy you are going to make me crazy yeah i make my mom crazy you do not make me crazy too much you know what will make me crazy
done that will make me crazy i will talk to you about that when you are done with your math you can do yours now b do not use orange
well black brown purple blue one can you help get a move on over there finish pieces that is an interesting one
very nice yes my darling yesterday you don t like snow very much it does it snow in guatemala i did not think so
snow did you like it or no j i like it the 1st time it snows and then after that i do not homework i don t love it though i do not think it is great
we have not talked about other fractions like do you know what fraction is colored in over here fractions great let us finish up everyone
one how about this
do if your thinking is that smart it is not going to be a problem you really cruised at the end finished sounds like a t at the end
end yes is it that once i come around and see that you are finished i am going to ask you to take your homework out and put your math away
kids who are not finished unfortunately will finish during coach d is time it that is an interesting one
before all of us nice he said he did this and this and this what i am going to ask you next math class is how do you know this is equal
away it is time to pack up for math up that is okay he is not going to throw it away boys and girls stop for just a moment and look up here
c i am waiting for wait our objectives today were to shade half and a 4th of a 4 by 6 array
that did you do this in were we able to explain what 14th of 24 was sorry okay thank you
246 how do you know 14th of 24 is 6 because is it because there is 6 in each of the 4 pieces
it is 6 +6 +6 +6 very good
all right guys make sure your desk is clear and you have a pencil out aside okay coming out to you is your exemplar
we are going to 1st start together like going over certain important parts of it together i am going to allow you to work small groups and brainstorm and continue it and then we will come back together to go over this one
okay you have done exemplars before and then once we are done time for meeting you will be getting another one that will be similar a little bit different that you will then do on your own 1st all right so your exemplar should be the same thing as what mine is up on the board
top a blank one got your name at the top okay
together who would like to read it out loud while the rest of us follow along on okay
it okay so you have a preview of the one you will be doing in a moment so here is the one that you are doing now again student read the one that you do have on your desk while we follow along
underline what is important in trying to solve do it is asking how much did he start with good the question is the most important thing
right okay so that is the most important thing this in purple vis a vis it will stay up there until i take it off with wet paper towel question that is what is most important because this is what we are solving for
so what in our paragraph is going to help us to figure out how many marbles dan started with student the marbles okay
that there is 3 total gained student 4 marbles okay which game did he win 4 marbles 2nd okay so the 2nd game 4 marbles right
sense okay what else is the 1st game he lost 2.5 marbles he lost one how do you say that one over 2 half so the 1st game he lost one half of the marbles important student in the 2nd game he won 4 marbles okay i have that already do you student something else
he finished with 32 marbles that is definitely important with so they give you the ending amount after he is played the games know he won the same number of marbles as he had at the end of the 2nd good so the 3rd game he won so that means is he getting them or having them taken away
them he is getting them so in the 3rd game he won the same number as in the 2nd game together the 3rd game he won same number as what he had in the 2nd game
sir how many he with and he had 3 he played 3 games of marbles in the 1st game he lost one half of his marbles in the 2nd game he won 4 marbles so it does not tell you how much that is what you have to figure out it is hard yes well how many he started with is what we are trying to solve
this is what we are solving for is how many he started with okay so they are giving you how many he had at the end and how many he won throughout the 3 games what we have to figure out is how many did he have before he played the games data does anybody have an idea what something he might could do to start it
think we are going to have to do some kind of operations right divide i am not sure what think of some strategies
see like how many he like he played 3 games of marbles so we have to see the 1st game he lost one half of his marbles okay strategy we have to add all the marbles that he won we need to figure out how many that is though for each of those right
we have numbers like half and you know 3rd game same number as 2nd game things like that so what kind of strategy could we use
strategy we are still doing operations if you are not sure of something think of the different strategies we use in math to try to problem solve
it a plan to see what you are going to do so what is your plan going to look like what kind of plan could we use student say again we have to find the the 3rd game he won right we do
games student you can divide 32 divide it by 3 would that solve it exactly though cause we have one he only got 4 marbles then you add it then you add after you get the number you can add 4 marbles he won with it
half then after you add that you can subtract the number he subtract one half out of 14 plan what can we do strategies there is guess and check working backwards
try you can add the 4 from the 2nd game and the 3rd game and add it to 32
yes you can take 32 and you can subtract from the marbles he all right so if we are starting with the number he finished with and we are trying to work from the 3rd game to the 2nd game to the 1st game what kind of plan are we actually using
plan divide what were you saying i said like he finished if he finished with 32 marbles we can subtract okay that many times we start at the beginning and work to the end but if we are starting at the end and going to the beginning we are working
good so this might be one that you want to try working backwards take what you know to be the ending and work it backwards this is hard many times we are just trying to solve it for your equal and figuring out that answer well we have how many he finished with we are trying to work backwards and figure out how many he started with before he played the games right working backwards
or you can do this you can divide 32 into 4 games he won and after that you can add the 4 games with the 3 games he started with the marbles then after that you can divide half then i do not know all right let us start trying to figure it out backwards we are ending with 32 okay
time i mean i have some solutions but i do not have all of the ways to work it through so we are going to work it together okay end this is our total that we end with right can i use your marker this is the total at the end but we are trying to figure out how many he started with right
backwards the end of the 3rd game he won the same number as he won at the end of the 2nd game one so games so if i am writing it on my board what should you be doing
us if it does not are we still learning something yes yeah we are learning a strategy that might not work and then we can work towards something else that will work okay so kind of working backwards do you think in some cases you might have to kinda guess and check some things sometimes that was one of our guess and check it was
strategy so we can try working backwards and if we are not getting as far as we need to go we can like plug in different numbers and just try it see what works what will make it work out right games how many games were there 33 so should i list each one separately yes okay so 1st 2nd and 3rd okay
here at the end his total ended up being 32 so here is your total way down here at the bottom right so we are trying to get our numbers to equal up to 32 i am going to do mine as like a triple chart so that i can show what i need to take care of like if we are taking away half or plussing 4 or whatever like that
so this is how much he won and how much he lost this is the operation and this is going to be our number of marbles maybe that we come up with until we try to get to 32
plan okay let us see if it works for us right at least we know where we are finishing okay and our goal is to figure out how many he started with right
with this is our goal okay going to have to think this one through myself
chart 0
away okay all right so student is thinking going in the right direction right he is going ahead processing some of this and moving us to where we need to go so he is thinking okay 1st thing he lost half so the operation for losing is what subtracting taking away half of whatever the start amount was
i am going to add this up here so i will know where i am starting taking away and how many i will end up with okay add 4 with the marbles the 2nd one okay so the 2nd one i will be doing said 44 marbles so it is just going to be a +4 operation right
that in the 3rd game he won the same number of marbles he had at the end of the 2nd game no it is times 4 think about it game 4 +4 is 8 because he listen he won 4 the 2nd game so we have got the +4
now in the 3rd game he won the same number of marbles he had at the end of the 2nd game so here is the end of the 2nd game so one means you are going to one multiply we are getting add thank you student we are going to add but do we know how many he won at the end of the 2nd game yet
is so it is an add but we do not know how much cause it has got to be the same as what is in the 2nd the same as in the 2nd is 4 the same as in the 2nd is 4 right he did win 4 but the key word here is at the end of the 2nd game so whatever was here +4 more here is your end of the 2nd game whatever number we have to put here is what we are again adding at the 3rd game
yet it may not be 4 +4 you see what i am saying all right so we are trying work backwards but do you think we need to just start trying to maybe guess and check them you can times 4 times equals 8 here is our operation right here
it we are trying to figure out how to get to 32 by taking away half from our starting amount away take that number and add 4 and then you are going to basically take that number and add it again to itself and it should equal what 3232 so that is our total we are trying to get right here is 32 okay so 3 no no no
process adding and subtracting that is what we have there in our operation teacher so let us start trying something what number would you like to try to start with student let us see if it works see now do we want to all write these and if it is not right can you mark out or erase and try again
marbles if i start with 8 what is going to happen at the 1st game he loses half half he loses half so if he loses half of 8 how many is he going to have left 44 now what is going to happen in the 2nd game 2nd game he won here is the total 2nd game we are going to then
add 44 and 4 make 88 now remember in the 3rd game he won the same amount that he ended with in the 2nd game so how many are we going to add here student how many did he end with in the 2nd game
student well we are going to add something the 3rd game he won the same number of marbles he had at the end of the 2nd game
how many marbles did he have at the end of the 2nd game student 88 so if he had 8 at the end of the 2nd game what do we have to add this all right let me change that back the way i had it
okay so 83rd game +8 more because these numbers should be the same that 1616 do these 2 match no 16 and 32 it now if this is this anywhere close to being where we need to go
that if this is too low where should we go here up 0 okay so we might have to use our pencil me all right so we decided we need to go up with our number number 12 okay 12
so we did go up several so that might work i do not know let us try so we have got our 12 we are going to guess and check all right let us see half half of 12 is 6 okay so he ends with 6 try that on your paper
step if he has 6 at the end of the 2nd game or the 2nd game he adds 4 figure that one out paper so the end of the 1st game he has 6 he adds 4 the 3rd game 2nd game you need to add 4
total remember the total you come up with here has to be added to itself in the 3rd game cause he won the same number operation think about what it says i want you to physically do it okay the thing with the 3rd game he is going to win the same number he ended with in the 2nd game so what are you going to write here
add what are you going to add says it says in the 3rd game he won the same amount that he had at the end of the 2nd game
marbles 4 this is 4 game yes okay then if he won the same amount he ended with in the 2nd game how many did he win 4 is this how many marbles he has at the end of the 2nd game
right okay and it says in the 3rd game he won the same number he had at the end of the 2nd game 6 +10 no you are still pulling this 6 from up here what number of marbles did he have at the end of the 2nd game
1010 if he won the same number in the 3rd game that he had at the end of the 2nd game what is he winning 1010 so do that 126 you are not adding all these together cumulative 10 plus you said 10 right there your chart is cumulative
that is that a 10 okay so 10 +10 what do you get okay i think 16 16 times finish your 3rd game you have got +10 so here is what he ended with in the 2nd game total remember your charts are cumulative
when you finish the 1st row we did 6 together game 2nd game you are plussing 4 total 3rd game you are plussing the same number to itself total you are adding all these together you do not need to do that
chart you are starting with 12 minus half is 66 +4 is 1010 +10 is 20 together 0 this is a cumulative thing okay started with 8 we ended up with what we started with
1212 we ended up with what 20 with 20 no okay so let us try something else right but we are going to have to do you think it is a good idea to write these on your paper the numbers we have tried there so we tried 8 we know it is too small we tried 12 we know it is still too small
we need to try something else remember some of you what you are doing when you come up with your totals here you are trying to then add all these together together this is a cumulative chart we talked about cumulative before
you are starting with something you are doing something to it to get a total then you are taking that total and changing it again to get a total taking that total and changing it again to get a total saying all right most of you have done this next step was 1010 some of you are getting hung up here
you have to add the same thing on the bottom good so it is 10 again good you are adding the same number you ended with on the 2nd game so if you had 10 at the end of the 2nd game you are adding 10 more add both of them okay this is the number you are trying to see if they match 16 so we are going to have to guess and check again
far all right student he said 16 paper 1st game take away half come up with your total
total whatever that total is add 4 more game we will do we will try that together in a moment moment okay so that and that added i thought it was like we do 16 +8 that is 24 +8 more is 32
right but does it adding 8 and adding 8 does that fit our strategies for trying to figure out based on he won 4 in the 2nd game and lost half in the 1st 16 yeah have to add 8 +4 equals 12 then you put the 12 at the bottom equals 12 then both of them equals 24
right wait you have come up with a number but what did you start with it okay let us go ahead and try to work this one together
starting at 16 student 161st game minus half equals 8 all right student what happens in the 2nd game 12 okay cause 8 and 4 more 12 good student what happens in the 3rd game good the total at the end of the 2nd game add it in the 3rd game and you get
24 does 24 and 32 match no but we know we need to do what with our number closer guessing and checking
all right student 19 okay want to try 19 better i do not know we ended up with 20 20 to 32 so do you think going up just 2 is going to be enough 10 so you want to try 20
20 go ahead and try this one half in the 2nd game +4 and then add it to itself
yet yeah that is going to be too high it is too high i do not know
the good thing about showing this is that you can use your same chart over and over by erasing and redoing otherwise you would have to re create your chart every time to show em but we can see how our numbers are changing what we have tried i should see some totals i do not know about that time teacher i know what it is
1st we are going to start with our 20 we are taking half away get what is taking away half of 20 if i make 20 in 2 groups how many would be in each of your groups
here i keep markers now what happens student 102nd game 1414 what are we going to do in the 3rd game student add 1414 and 14 that student 28 is it too high
high it is not high enough go higher than 20 22 i need to pick somebody quiet student 24 she says 24
go we are not quite there so we will just skip a few and go up to 24
one we will check it at the end there it went again make sure you show all of your start and ends
work should you just show it and erase it all and just tell us the answer or should you show everything you know tried that is what is great about what did here on showing what we started with and ended with since we are using our same chart over and over otherwise you might have to re create your chart every time trying to show all our guess and checks
know so we know that this one did not work that one did not we know all these have not worked so far let me erase this so there ya go i will give everybody a moment to try it come up with your answers 24 half of 24 is 24
012 is this the correct way to do it well you started with 24 took half away added 4 and then you are going to add it to itself so 16 and 160 and i like how you circled that and showed which one did work in the end
work 0 we have have not we time so instead of trying every even we are doing like every other it should right
cause we are at 28 now so it is going to have to be somewhere up there right through has everyone gotten a chance to try this one see 24 student if we take half away what is half of 2412 okay good because 12 and 12 make 24 so 12 is half our next step student what are we going to do
add 4 okay 12 +41616 okay student what is the next step 16 +16 equals 32 yea did it work yes okay what do you think we should do now to show there is all of our start and ends
no we found it right so how could we show that we found what we need put it in words we definitely are going to have to put it in words right but just even with this part what could we do to kinda show make it stick out better what do you think student circle tried circle the one that worked cause we are trying to solve for our answer
32 i have even written what our total should be necessary yes 0 yes exemplar right and do not forget to write your sentence how you got the whole thing using our words right we should use pictures of some sort
numbers in our word form is it important to use maybe math terms we can use that help us understand things better write question is how many marbles did dan start with
okay how could we write that he i want to say dan can you write on the back if you run outta room please write on the back
and if you are one that does not like writing on the back some people do not like to write on the backs of things you are welcome to get another sheet of notebook paper there yeah dan started with 24 marbles very good 24 marbles now let us see
i am looking at my chart over here and it has good exemplars if i am at a level one that is showing no understanding that number 2 level 2 not complete uses some pictures and numbers to explain some thinking but maybe has some answers incorrect well i am thinking that we may have it correct
i mean we might think we have and it really not be but we are working this together so i am pretty certain that this is correct thinking and numbers explanations so let us look at level 3 correct answers using pictures numbers and words to explain okay i have got a chart some type of picture i have got my numbers i have got my total okay did i use some words to explain
okay and a chart is okay to be like representative of a picture we started with 24 and then we ended with 32 look we are at maybe a level 3 but do we want to just stop there enough we want to try to be level 4s right
so let me read you what level 4s are above and beyond student used pictures numbers and words to explain thinking the student goes beyond what is asked to find more than one way to get the correct answer or maybe explains in more words how they got their answer okay so we said in words what the answer is but have we written in words how we got the answer
no okay and using multiple ways would work but we have got our chart our start and end we are doing a guess and check kinda thing is what we are working with it dan started with 24 marbles we want to explain why we know this is correct what could we say student we started guessing and checking okay
24 okay so we used the strategy that is a good math term strategy of guess and check and continued that pattern until we could find a number that worked to make the total we needed something of that sort did okay so use your words how you would like to explain i like the word guess and check strategy
words i am going to say i since this is my work on the board
it okay i kinda changed the words a little bit okay this one was a tough one this was a tough one to work on
it was fun it was fun trying to figure things out and everybody was happy another way to have worked this we basically ended up using the guess and check and plugging into a chart you could have done the working backwards strategy where you start with 32 and then everything you would have to do would work backwards so you would do opposite operations to get back to the beginning that would be a little more tricky i think yes
could not you do that like on a to get like more than one way exactly if you had shown this way and then maybe showed the working backwards strategy as another way that would have right there by having your words showing 2 strategies end up being correct it would have been a 4
could not you do like 24 times something was equal to the total well the only thing is because each of the games something different happened each time it is not the same thing every time
game you could just say you know times it by 3 or what have you but it is a different operation taking place every time okay here most everyone have that one
i do not want to waste our time i want you to see the one that you are going to do on your own and we can read it together and maybe highlight what is important and then tomorrow we will review it one more time re read it so that you have it fresh in your mind tomorrow and then you work on that one on your own
similar a little bit of it will be different maybe the numbers or the operations or something like that can we use the same strategy as you guess and check you will need to see works a guess and check might work working backwards might work cool most everybody have that one
we are going to give em the 2nd one
i guess you think we should okay once you have all of your notes for this one and we have handed you your new one to put your name on then that is your clue you can stand up and go ahead and put your 1st exemplar in your mailbox so that you have only your new exemplar on your desk
you go backwards okay so you are adding more information about how you can work it backwards i like that student good job she is adding more information about how you could have also worked it backwards okay it is nice student you have all of your information you can put in your mailbox yes this one should have been helpful
no she left she thought sitting here okay can i erase this yes you may erase that
purple okay we are going to have to get a wet nap to get that off cause i used a vis a vis by accident anything your new piece of paper on your desk notice the name name you are going to work it on your own
together no it is not boring it was fun i was like wow that is a bright marker i did not realize it was a vis a vis
off that is what i do not like about em all right here is our new one we will read it together i think we should underline what is important together and then we will give you some time to maybe start it today and then we will let you continue tomorrow on this one all right student let us read now this dan losing his marbles
this what is important the main thing that is important before you even start working it student the question say how many marbles did dan end with here is the key word end how many marbles did dan end with no no so would working backwards possibly work this time
no maybe not cause we know how many he had at the end
right we know what he started with okay so we are trying to figure out how many he ends with right number of marbles right last time it was start so we tried to think of it backwards so these marbles we are trying to figure out how many he ended with maybe working backwards might not work because we need to know the ending
we do not know the ending so we can not start from the end and work forward we are going to have to start from the beginning
question what is important that you need to highlight student dan played 3 games with his 32 marbles okay 3 games with 32 marbles so is 32 something really important no that start with that that is what he started with right
marbles is it okay to add some reminder notes in there when you are highlighting you can definitely and i like writing that you started with this i am trying to get to what he ended with
important student he lost one.5 wait a minute is that one.51 and 2 no one it is a fraction if it is one of 2 you say it as one not and a half one it is just one half
no so he lost 1st game he lost one half of his marbles so that is important so lost what does lost mean is it plussing minusing subtracting subtracting good minusing subtracting myself that might be important to do what else student in the 2nd game he won 4 marbles okay 2nd game won 4 marbles
mean add okay so won means add i am putting myself a little note there +4 anything else that is important yes i know one thing student what else is important anything yeah the 3rd game he won twice as many as he did in the 2nd okay so 3rd game won means what
add okay we are adding twice as many as the 2nd game no that is important something else i can highlight okay we are getting can you solve this problem in more than one way if you can show multiple ways to solve it does that help you get to a 4 okay if you can come up with the correct answer that at least gets you towards a 3
if you attempt it and try to do some strategies that will get you at least to a 2 but we are trying for a 4 so we are going for the correct answer showing it in words numbers pictures if you can come up with more than one strategy and explain why you did it that way that will get you to a 4 so you have a couple minutes maybe about 3 or 4 minutes to kinda re read it and kinda get something started
these no you do not think it through chart okay think about what we did twice is like saying 22 times 2 times so it is saying 2 times
well for the 3rd game like however many he had at the end of the 2nd game it would be like saying times 2 for the 3rd game sense if he ended up with 4 at the end of the 2nd game
end no that is what he won during the game that you got to think end of the 2nd game just like on our other chart
game i see some people getting something going some kind of picture or something does this one mean what he started with what where is this one the same thing as the other one that we just did it is a little different look at it he started with 32 marbles the question is we need to know how many he ended with
it is a little different than the one we did together but started with that is kinda confusing no the last one we knew how many he ended with with it is much simpler if you think about it
okay so games that is like the number of his games
games yeah operations or functions either 10 i see
times it would be yeah that times 2 words this is going to this is going to throw em off a bit
game he just won twice as many as he did in the 2nd game that is going to throw em off guys pay close attention to the wording of this one if you exactly what we did in the last problem you will not get the right answer you have got to think about the words what you need to do plus last time we had an ending total and we were guessing and checking trying to figure out what we started with
different the wording here is a little different look at in the 3rd game he won twice as many as he did in the 2nd game game so keep that in mind what that means
he won in the 2nd game he won twice as much in the 3rd game in the 3rd game so whatever he won in the 2nd game twice as many is how many he won in the 3rd game
means 32 well you need to i am not sure where you are going with this because you need to remember your each of the games you have got to do these operations this is you have got this backwards start so do not let that confuse you
after well at least you have got your brain thinking about it a little bit tomorrow we will re read it get your brain thinking of it again and then you will continue you may realize tomorrow when you get it back wow i have started this incorrectly let me fix it you may have some time to reflect and fix what you have done okay so give me your papers please and i will give them back to you tomorrow
one a little bit different than thank you once i have your paper go ahead and get your agendas out so you can get your homework and all of that
good 0 check with student i know she had 3 nickels earlier that kept floating around
okay so today we are still talking about strategies for solving addition problems
i just want to review for a few minutes some of the strategies you remember or some of the strategies you know for solving addition problems
back what are some strategies for solving addition problems i am just going to make a list for solving some addition problems d breaking the numbers apart breaking very good else breaking numbers apart
what else are some strategies for solving large addition numbers c place value using place value good what else are you thinking i do not see you thinking
landmark numbers using landmark numbers
okay so maybe we can find a way to help to name that strategy yes loaning and taking away loaning and taking away okay yes
subtraction we are talking about adding numbers and she has a strategy where she subtracts she borrows and gives back what are you thinking
freeze before you go there we are trying to figure out how we can name the strategy that you have been using and said grouping about grouping or regrouping which can also be known as u s
algorithm okay yes using what you know using what you know
anything there is one more i am thinking about thinking of one more parts adding up place value we have that using place value
yes use someone said it earlier yes pictures why is it funny that said pictures
using pictures as a tool says i am thinking of division you are thinking more of division when you say pictures okay multiplication yes u s algorithm i have it right here
problems eslds is a strategy a tool for organizing our thinking to solve problems efficiently but we are talking about specific strategies for solving these large addition problems okay
all right so far we have breaking numbers apart using place value using landmark numbers grouping or regrouping using the u s algorithm starting with what you know and using starter problems okay problems now we talk a little bit about adding larger numbers
yesterday some of us shared our thinking about the 2 solutions that we had for 145 +226
we shared our thinking about the 2 solutions that we had and the 1st solution said that we could do 300 thank you +60 +11 you then we would get for an answer 371 good
the 2nd way said that we can have 145 +226 and we could use grouping 11 this one we carry the other one which is in the tenths place now and then we add
a it is because your names have the same beginning numbers 4 +2 equals 6 answer now you were supposed to write about it shared if you did not get to share yesterday i would love to hear your thinking today
for number one on page 29 how would you explain to someone someone else number 2 sorry 29 how would you explain to someone else how solution one works and where does the 60 come from and where does the 11 come from
d the 60 comes from the 40 +20 and 11 comes from the 5 +6
60 the 11 comes from the equation of 5 +6 which equals 11 and so 40 +20 equals 60 and 5 +6 equals 11 and that thank you
thank you what about number 2 someone read number 2 for us read number 3 i am confused i apologize read number 3 for us
so 40 +20 and then what about this number up top here the number up top came from the 11 over here
j the one on top that stands for the 11 that when you had to add 5 +6 which equals 11 you put a one there and carry the one 10 what is it equal to 10 people agree that that one is equal to 10
yes okay so yes it the one comes from the 11 in 5 +6 yes what does it really equal to we see one here but does that mean it is just one
what does it equal to top why do we put a 10 here reason why are we calling this one a 10
back why are we calling this one a 10 10 we put it up here and it is just a one t because there is only one 10
a i was thinking that because it does not belong with the one because it is a 10 and the algorithm way you can not put 2 numbers under one column okay says when you are doing u s rule you cannot put 2 numbers under one column
so 2 numbers can not go right there but she says there is one 10 in the number 11 say because the one is in the 10s place and the 10s place is in the middle for right now but not for all of them you have to put the 10 where the other 10s are and add it into the equation okay
we can not just place that one that is really a 10 under the ones column that there are specific rules that go with the u s some what i want us to do is are there any questions about this before we move on about these 2 solutions
what i would like us to do is get with one other partner lay here on the carpet and what i want you to do is start to solve this problem with your partner right here on the carpet
i am going to give you 2 minutes and then have somebody come up and share your thinking
fine right here on the carpet if you have a pencil you can write it right here on your board you do not have to get up and get a piece of paper
that is fine you can solve it wherever you need to solve it
fine you want to go up and write your thinking
you are going to do it all right bring it back here you go you we would love your attention 186 +258
what i thought was that the 6 +8 equals 14 you carry the 10 to the 10s place and put the 4 down in the ones place one +8 +5 is 14
carry the one to the 100s place but the 4 in the 10s place one +one +2 equals 4
comments is this different u s algorithm way different from when you use place value that is solving the problem using u s
algorithm different from solving the problem using place value
is okay
bring it back is solving this problem using the u s algorithm way different than solving using place value what did you think and what did your partner say
f i said it is not different because the problem they added the 6 +8 and it equals 14 but then they put the 10 where the 10 is and they add 80 +50 and that is 130
they put the 100s in the 100s place so you feel like it is the same u s algorithm is the same as adding by place value
m i think it is the same as well because when you use place value you usually add the ones 10s and 100s and when you are using the u s algorithm you are usually doing the same thing but it is just up and down some great thinking happening
t i did not know because the u s algorithm way is hard for me because it is confusing to carry the numbers to the spots okay
you it is a little confusing to see the numbers that you have to carry over into the next column yeah because sometimes i do not understand where to carry them or go
it is like columns so you put it in the 10s column 10 +8 equals 18 and that equals 240 so then there is a 4 and it is the 10s and you carry the one it is 100 over to the 100s column then they say 100 +200 +100 equals 400
you put them all together and it gives you the answer thank you a i agree with that it is the same way
you stay in one column like this like in place value you stay with the same like you are like doing the 100s then the 10s then the ones and doing it the opposite way it is the same where it has place value but just like people did the 100s 1st or the ones place
okay place value you do one column then the next column then the final column yes
i noticed something 11 +100 +258
no it looks that way but because we can see each of those numbers in each column we know the numbers are different what yes that would not be there thank you girls
it here is what we are going to practice today because the u s algorithm way is a way you will see other people mainly adults adding larger numbers okay it is a super efficient way for adding larger numbers and it is very important for you all to have more than one way of solving problems right
yes so now we are going to practice using the u s numbers you are going to be with the math groups you were with yesterday around before we get started we will go over the directions
you pass one back to please thank you okay all right do me a favor desk thank you
seat hi happy take your stuff and go back to your desk take the millipede back to ms room you came the long way to get here
directions he is just a millipede hi there do not use your math paper
you i just need you to go to your seat right okay so that is enough thank you
math we only have a few minutes left so if you look on page 11 turn to page 11 11 adding larger numbers what i need you to do is let us see
m when adding 23 and 4 digit numbers add the ones 1st then 10s 100s 1000s and so on
examples the examples are 54 +25 and they showed you which digits are in the tenths place and which digits are in the ones place the other example of 54 +25 again shows you which digit is in the 10s place and in the ones place but it is showing you a little bit differently
noticing that the 1st example has you adding the ones place 1st the 2nd example has you adding the ones place and the 10s place numbers what are you noticing about these numbers in the box
j i noticed in the box there is one digit 2 digit and 4 digit numbers right anybody notice anything else and then
i noticed at the last one on page 11 it is 100s it is 727 and 51 and then there is not like the same type of place value so you are noticing that 727 and 51 do not have the same amount of digits
so you will not have both numbers being in the same place for place value
a the pattern that i see is that there are 2 digits 3 digits and 4 digits and it is 3 digits +2 digits and 3 digits +4 digits and then it equals wonderful
patterns has noticed that the digits we are moving up in digits we start with 2 digits then we move to 3 digits then we move to 4 digits these are definitely larger numbers what you are going to do what you are going to do i want you to take that home for homework okay
what you are going to do is you will with your group complete page 11 and page 12 and when you finish i am going to give you maybe 15 minutes these so get with your group from yesterday i will place you with a group
who let me check and see what your group numbers are
who is your group reading tonight independent reading minutes 45 and complete that math sheet okay
what i suggest that you do is you start for maybe the 1st 5 minutes or so independently solving the problems then go back and compare your answers that way if someone is having a hard time they can say hey me i have a question about this then you all can discuss it okay
solve independently for about 5 minutes and then compare answers
discussions some people have finished and i can see that
start to open up with discussions about your answers and how you received your answers
difficult which one the ones with the thousandths are tricky then why don t you all discuss one of those choose one to discuss 1st this one 1803 +1104
okay so what did you get for an answer 2907 did everybody have that t because the way i looked at the number it looked like there was a 10 right there but then i had to look at the whole number
104 okay
it was tricky because i had to add all of them and i could not understand because sometimes i thought it was 800 +400 okay it really tricked me
so what caused you to come up with because you guys have the correct answer her what helped you to come up with the right answer and you all did not have any issues or concerns with that
numbers what we are talking about on page 11 because i think and may want to go over it one the only one you thought was tricky was the 1803
on did anybody have any difficulty with any of these then he got the answer at the end what was difficult for you
because you thought it would be what 500 so you were rounding this 545 number it okay how did you end up figuring it out
adding the 100s 1st then add the 1000s so by adding the ones 10s 100s then 1000s last
you if you want you can move on to the next page how is it going over here
good how is it going over here good we are on the 2nd page
it the 3 numbers are all in the 1000s place now that you are adding 1000s it is becoming more difficult
yeah my dad showed me how taught me it okay and how was that
attention yes thank you you and your partners will agree on one problem that you want to represent on the board one person gets to go up to write
you all want to make sure that the problem is solved the way that the problem is solved correctly and then the person can go up and write it on the board everyone will go up to represent it but just one person will go up to write it clear yes any questions okay i have a question yes
does it have to be one of the problems that we have already solved or any one you have already had does it have to be the most difficult one we have had do you want to chose the most difficult one maybe m why would you want to chose the most difficult one to represent
challenge because some people might think it is difficult and we can help them right can we choose which number we want on page 12 choose which one you want chose okay
yes so that is why we are doing that one
i think i went wrong somewhere did you start from the ones place the part i do not get is when we get over 10 do we put down the 10s place
good question we always have to put the 0 at the end so we have to put the 6 down that is where i went wrong got it
so now that you have written a 6 right there where is the 2 13 how much is 8 +3 16 okay and you put your one right there
1400 i got it wrong and had to go back
14651st i got them confused and then i did 9 +one equals 10 +5 is 15 then carried the one
160 freeze before you start erasing i need you to finish hearing what he is saying and then you need to figure out where you may have went if you made a mistake you have not finished showing the evidence
13 +3 equals 16 and then you have to put the 0 at the end and put the 6 down and carry the one
4 5 +9 equals 14 and then you have to put the 2 zeros everyone should be writing now
board you have 2 minutes 1465 now your team needs to help you figure out what you did
right i am hoping people are making appropriate choices are you making appropriate choices right now
task okay yes you have not discussed every single problem have not so what did you just say
i placed the 21s that i forgot to place on top of the numbers i have got another one on top of 200
j that is something i noticed when you did your other work when solving addition that your forgot to carry over numbers and you have to do that it is very important because if you forget it you can make a calculation error
problem one minute
okay all right let us make this fast we are going to share our thinking
it please go to your desks
expression the expression was 3245 +1239 +981 equals we did not have time to write the rest what did you get for an answer 5465
the number that is not the equation it is just the which box is it in
7 it is in your 8th box right box sorry these are not numbered in your book any questions about what they did how they solved it
5465 good
we put the 5 down and carried the one we put the 6 down and carried the one and i knew that it was 1400 and then i put down the 4 and carried the one
mind i am actually going to stop us right there for questions
i want to be able to before time runs out to allow the other people to share their thinking and present their work a thank you coaster very good
you ladies let us be efficient please
our expression was 5268 +4910 +1683 and our answer was 11869 and the answer is 11869 how did you show your work we did not have time 1st you guys erased it
yeah we were getting confused with that
i have a question in regards to the work that you have shown now and something a comment that said earlier about her thinking
she said she could not place 2 numbers in one column but it looks like in the thousandths place you guys had to place an 11
so does that make is statement true or false
homework if you did finish them put them in your math folder monday take out your math notebook inside of your math notebook you do not have to write the question but i need you to start to answer question number 2 describe strategies you are learning to add 3 digit numbers efficiently
you do not have to copy down the question i just need you to answer the question yes mister c told me to bring back that hat before dismissal you need to answer number 2 complete that task
describe strategies you are learning to add 3 digit numbers efficiently thank you
task i am going to give you about 5 minutes and then we are going to share out our thinking
words describe strategies you are learning to add 3 digit numbers efficiently here are some of the strategies that we said
this is a list of some of the strategies we talked about earlier i want you to describe the strategies you are learning yes
does it have to be all no just some i do not get it you are learning different strategies for learning addition 3 digit number addition we made a list of the strategies we are solving
about when we give a description of something we are talking about what it is like right so give a description of the strategies you are learning to solve 3 digit addition problems
question complete the task
you no
you yes
minute okay anybody care to share out
minute why are you worried about what he is doing
writing reading and complete this page
combinations actually here directions okay
out one 2 3 people brave people starting right here m i said all of the same places we also add numbers to get to landmark numbers we have also been adding 100s 10s and ones to get like numbers thank you
a the strategy i want to discuss is place value it is addition because all you have to do is add ones 10s and 100s thank you weekend i have been learning how to use the u s
algorithm it has made it easy for me it is efficient it is organized using landmark numbers helped me too how it helped me is thank you
books good job thinking very good job
rotation you are going to come to small group with me and you are going to bring your reading journal you are going to bring a pencil reading journal sorry math journal
pencil bring your book book the practice book no practice book just your book we may look up some vocabulary terms when you are in group work everybody has their group color labeled on their independent work
games remember if you have a problem with the computer find something else independently to do you need to be working on area of circles on the computer skill we have worked on it a little bit but it is practice what is you are doing in your independent work will be for a grade but it is not a quiz like it says
k are we bringing our computers to our desk or you can sit in the back of the floor if you want to that let me go back here and make sure our switch is turned on for the computer and that the wireless is on
teacher yes madam what do we do once we are done with our work independent independent once we are done with our work and remember you have to show all of your work the whole formula all the way through
part you all can not have the answer key board that is fine there shhh do not talk about it sir i did not that chair right there
okay and you may want to change and move someplace you have a seat circles open up your math journals i am right here you are fine i am going to stand up here and do think anyway
head it is all right same color of hair you know and see that chair right there that nobody is using just drag that over there over circles
circle no corners no side no sides they are an irregular polygon i like i like
what does circumference what does that even sound like when you look at that what does that word sound like circ and you see that so you are thinking circle
right fence goes around around so circumference measures the distance around a circle circle teacher our computers are not working none of them
well no me and is it says the domain there are other laptops else use the desktop over there or play another game independently so circumference is the measurement of the distance around a circle
journals make sure your journals say today is date january 30 30th 2012
circles label it neatly so that you know
you have it written down already now we know enough from having worked on circles throughout the year on our spiral homework to know the parts of the formula but we do not necessarily know it very well right
i am going to give you a cheating trick and it is okay to use cheating tricks right formula c equals pi times diameter
work if not i am thinking it may be your alls login is something wrong together now we always remember food cause we are always hungry when we get here in math
formula cherry c pie is delicious cherry pie is delicious and that is a pneumonic device
it is a word trick like we have used before in math to help us remember and i use it even as an adult i am like 0 what was that one remember now pie when i bake something in the oven this is how i remember this
i bake usually when i bake i bake 325 but pies are special 3.14 write that down what do you know about pi is that really all there is to pi 3.14
no no that is not all there is to pi but that is all we use is 3.14 now what up there we know what circumference is right
mean here is my circle measure it measures how wide the circle who can give me a better definition of what diameter is
you are saying it right but i would like to use some math language out well what can i do to show it up here at the board line i could draw a line through the middle of the circle
that from what to what from one side of the circle to the other other going through the middle circle does anybody know it is called the midpoint
it is called the midpoint and if the midpoint has the letter b guess what the name of that circle is b whatever the midpoint letter is that is you name the circles and angles and rays and all of that with letters and combinations of letters
yes i think i figured out a way to how to remember what diameter is because the circle is like a clock and the diameter if you add the midpoint in the middle it kinda looks like those are its hands kind of
diameter if this was my pie if this is an apple pie if i ate from this side of the pie to this side of the pie plate i would feel like i am going to die too so write this down
remember if you ate from one side of another to a pie plate that means you eat how much of the pie thing if i made you an entire pie and brought it in tomorrow because i thought you were just going to eat the real well you mean just like a little it was tracked down the middle
it if i ate from one side of that pie all the way to the other would not you feel kinda icky afterwards is that way when you see it and it says diameter and you are like what does it mean what does it mean i remember
brain and think about all the times you use music and you can remember where you were when you heard that song trick have you finished your independent work yeah go ahead and go to the section on circles and see if there is anything in there that is neat and interesting or any questions you have for when you get to me cause we are going to switch in a minute
so we are going to look here now and i am going to pass this out this and we are only going to do one of these circumference questions and then i am going to send you all to go do some other work
and let us look at one it says the diameter is one and 8 tenths millimeters calculate the circumference oops i do not have an eraser eraser throw it well let us not and say we did cause you might get the back of is head or that cup of coffee and as much as likes coffee he does not want to wear it
thank you sweetie so let us look at number one all cherry pie is delicious
know do i know what the circumference is is what is pi 3.14 let us say it correctly times diameter
circle one and 8 tenths one and 8 tenths millimeters now what am i going to do do you multiply those 2 numbers to get the circumference i multiply these 2 numbers to get the circumference now i am multiplying what kinds of numbers are these multiple students decimals decimals what do i do to multiply decimals do i line up my decimals what do i do
up you just multiply right do i fool with those decimals at all initially
normal it is just when you add once we get to the end
finished so i am going to get my hug here and i am going to get my kiss here my placeholder q start making kissy faces
they cause nobody wants me to run around going see even backs away all i just make crazy noises right fun that is you
not that i am boring you got to have fun now i am multiplying 3 and 14 hundredths by one 5 now this is the interesting part
here well since for a decimal is like at the top and then at the top you go over like how ever many spaces there is or a decimal is so since this is right there you go over 2 and put your decimal there but now down here in this factor i also have another decimal there so instead of going over 2 i go over 01 more
so i go one 2 3 to the left remember left there is a number that is on you just got to remember it so that is how you calculate circumference tomorrow in group we are going to work on calculating the area of a circle switch make sure you have this in your notes what should you do with this sheet
no no keep it in your keep it in your folder bring it back to meeting tomorrow see you all tomorrow good job
m what is that like last year in 4th i got i can not wait to talk to him and get to know him really well
it is exciting we are going to rotate our centers do you may want to go find another seat
distracting and that we do not need just make sure that you are in a place where you can work you may want your journal there in case you need to look at it okay yeah did you go over that test over the weekend yeah
say sit down at your chair one well you may want to move so that you are not being distracted do we have any clipboards it is back by the laptop cart so you all went over your test with your parents this weekend my mom was not very happy your mom was not very happy
neither was my mom my mom grounded me for a week do you think that was a smart decision as a parent yeah my dad yelled at me cs now cs are considered to be average but when you consider this class and your ability is that okay
somebody mark that out x thank you my dad just yelled at me and my mom was so what are you going to do to instead of going and getting yelled at about math because math is not i do not want you all to go home and get yelled and then think math is bad bad what can you do to prevent that from happening next time
getting better grades but how are you going to get a better grade not coloring on my shoe not coloring on your shoe when we are having class start do what now putting effort into your work putting more effort into your work on going back and checking and doing it the way teacher says like go back and check it and do it a 2nd time and compare your answers
what about making sure you really have your facts memorized i think that is getting a couple of you yeah that is getting we are going to have a timed test again this week and for some of you all the timed test is like this but then when we go for the application part you forget and you make mistakes in your multiplication
part some of you all are struggling with it and should not be and remember i am here during recess half the week me and i did not bite did i
circles it is the same stuff we talked about with polygons and quadrilaterals but we are looking at circles so we are looking at circumference and we are looking at area figure circumference is not a term we are familiar with from what we did before
so if we look at circumference get out your journals
write that word in your journal and then i want you to tell me what you think or what you have seen when you look at that what 0 down here
work do you have a laptop babe 0 no i am showing what do you see
hear what do you think circle circle that is circ right circle like around the circle the ference reminded me of a fence right circle and that is right
down distance around a circle down and if you are doing independent work and you are seated next to somebody on a laptop please make sure you are more involved in your independent work than their laptop or you can cut down which i do not think you want to do
now we have little tricks for everything we learn in here just about formula c equals pi times d well c stands for circumference there is your trick for circumference pi is p i and what is pi
3.14 and we know that it is really more than 3.14 but that is what we use in our formula is 3.14 and d is the diameter diameter now diameter if i find the diameter of that circle what am i measuring the middle the whole the distance across tell me more
or the thing that divides the circle in half the distance across the circle at the middle center mid here it is cutting through that circle right at the midpoint now know that when they name a circle whatever the midpoint letter is that is the name of the circle so if this was a x that is circle x
now i remember this because if this was a real pie and i ate from one side of that pie all the way to the other i would feel like i was going to die die so you can write that down down diameter distance from one side of the circle to the other through the midpoint and then put in parenthesis if i ate from one side of the pie to the other i would feel like i was going to die
i would not you would just eat more that is an idiom it is a hyperbole it is not necessarily fact thought you were going to call me an idiot i was confused for a minute no no right
good use the desktop if it is not working
in do not just put them back on the shelves now evidently had heard my trick before and remembers it but the pneumonic device for circumference equals pi times diameter is cherry pie is delicious
down c pi delicious take this like seriously really really i have a comment what is your comment cherry pie is delicious we will talk about apple pie later pie all area do we have math stars this week i do not have math stars this week
so what do we do when we are done with that look through your math book and get yourself prepped for group kinda look and see if you can not come and no more than i am going to teach you anyway come with questions that are like wow where did he come up with that
i would prefer if we did not but we can there is one right there you are working on circumference right yes sit i am more worried about you all learning and remembering the formula than the computation so how many of you all think my trick is cool
like i am going to use that good but we have not really studied this yet we have used the trick for homework but we have not really looked at it right no now we are going to use we are going to put this into application and we are going to do one a
out she is laughing at me me she thinks it is funny that her teacher has broken bones that well we are looking at using a formula we always write down the entire formula 1st right
so i need to write down c equals pi times diameter now read to me what it tells me about one a what does it say calculate the circumference of the circle read to me the given diameter equals one.8 millimeters one.8
one and 8 tenths thank you one and 8 tenths millimeters so do i know what c is yes what is pi
r one and 8 tenths one and 8 tenths millimeters right now what am i going to do here multiply 3.14 times now i am going to ask you the same thing i asked you all before you took your last test and some of us did not do so well do you know how to add yes do you know how to subtract yeah multiply yes
problem multiply so if you have to multiply a 3 digit by 2 digit number you have to be able multiply and you have to be able to add add right so if you know how to do those things how do i do this 3.14 times one and 8 tenths so i am just going to multiply go ahead and do that and let us see what we get
i want to get you all in group before i give you anything to send you off on it 12s what was the product
e 5 and 652 hundredths 5 and 652 thousandths thousandths remember if you look here if you thought how many zeros is that
3 if there were 3 zeros in a number it would be a 1000 right so it will be thousandths 6 and 562 thousandths millimeters now remember it is the distance around something
alone these are going to come back to group tomorrow we are going to look at area tomorrow we will practice some circumference tomorrow and then we will look at the area yes apple pie circumference is the one i missed on the test this is the one i that is one of the ones that you missed
bonus so those on the test were bonus go question no no no
we are going to work on it tomorrow go to the 3rd rotation
is going to be in class i am not sure places he seemed to understand what we were doing which is a very good sign
understood i like cause then the class will finally be full i would be rather disappointed if you came over here and said i do not like him that would be kind of weird but if i did i would not have said it well yeah am i missing anybody
group green group going once did not bring my paper over here going twice teacher do you have a band aid i am out of band aids here go see miss p or if she or another 5th grade teacher does not have one go to the clinic miss p has a ton there you go out we are looking at circles
and you have all background with circles
know they are round the outside of the circle is called a circumference there is no side radius is half the diameter of a circle
she stole mine you just realized she said what you wanted to say diameter the diameter is the line of the circle from one side to the other here is a circle and here is a line
that splits it equally in half kind of a line of symmetry that is a chord you are right that is a chord so the diameter splits it equally in half equally in half and forms a line of symmetry sweet
circle so if this was z this would be circle z
pi now i know what you are talking about 2 so is saying that if you have the diameter of a circle if you divide the diameter by 2 you get the radius radius
so r equals d divided by 2 diameter equals radius times 2 so say my diameter is 10 real easy numbers here
10 that means radius would be 5 times 2 so if i know my radius is 5 10 divided by 2 is 5 works you need to know what radius and diameter measure radius radius is midpoint to the outer edge of the circle
and if i ate from the outer edge to the midpoint of the circle that would be rad rad see radius r a d i u s that is rad diameter goes all the way across the circle through the midpoint creating a beautiful line of symmetry thank you
and if ate from one side of that pie pan to this pie pan i would feel like i was going to die diameter i have a question about radius could you do a panel line through this too like could you do it like this yeah your radius can go this way
way it could go so it does not just have to go up and down or side to side radius is anywhere same student exactly so it is always in the same spot now get out your journals and write down this information
i do not want you you all get it and i know you all get it but i want you to have it so that if you get home and your parents go i do not know what to do you can say well here it is and if you have the tricks you can teach your parents the tricks cause guess what they probably never learned the tricks tricks my parents grew up in columbia they probably had math tricks in columbia too
yeah but they would not be the same maybe you never know do you need me to move my big head no do you need me to move my big head
i am writing these are easy probably not
there you all like racing doing math lessons it is fun that is why i was kinda hoping that we did not get to go so maybe tomorrow you would find a racing one a different mimeo which that one is cool
i like it when it is more one on one competition than it is like that where everybody does their own time so we are going to learn the formula for circumference and area today groups now if you all get to where you are like slow down just let me know circumference circle distance around
that cherry pie is delicious delicious c pi this is the formula
in and just like you said if you do not know the diameter but you know the radius all you have to do is multiply it by 2 to get the diameter had not gotten there with my other groups you all are impressive now i always plug anything that i know and i keep my variables on one side and my numbers on the other
work now if you look at our worksheet yes dear it is cool because the sign for pi is like it looks like a pie how do you see a pie in it yeah you can how i can see one whatever like you know when they have the little crust like all over
gotcha like the outer edge of the crust and where is there is the lattice going over the pie saying no i do see what you are saying but not everybody is going to see that thing looking at number one it tells me the diameter so i do not have to fool with multiplying by 2 to get the diameter from the radius
all i have to do is one a all i have to do is plug in is yes no cause it says to calculate the circumference is i know what pi is 3.14 see and i always just tell myself i bake all pies at 3.14 degrees even though i know that is not really right
i know that it just helps me remember pi and we bake at 3.14 cause i am thinking cooking so then i know that my diameter is one.81 one and 8 tenths one and 8 tenths cause it is really not
sorry to interrupt what is of using our password you are going to need somebody else to log you in because you do not have one yet i will get you one though if you will ask one of these people to help you they will definitely do that kids so now we are multiplying decimals by decimals
product it is going to get smaller decimals time decimals no i think let us put it into practice and do it and see what happens 8 times 4
32 2 carry my 3 25 hug and a kiss right yeah 4 one one and 3
35 and 652 thousandths millimeter oops not squaring anything larger what do we do when we are done i am getting ready to switch right now
ahead fill it out the whole formula and then you all go back to your seats 4 if you have a laptop go ahead and log it off in if you have independent work you are going to make sure you have it at your seat
if you are at the mimeo you are going to finish up whoever is going right now and then you all will go back to your seats and my last group i will get you all 1st thing tomorrow
seats i am impressed with yes right behind you i believe seats just put it back on the sign
review and my last group i think you all will be able to chime in anyway circles looking at circles we are finding area and circumference what is the circumference what is circumference
the space around a circle space around because if i had the space around the circle it could be like the space around the circle but in that box circumference that would be the area of the box minus the area of the circle around the circle the what around a circle the circumference that tells me you are not real sure what it means
what does it mean around so you are using your words to help you what we talked about give me the math word that i am wanting though perimeter circumference is directly related to perimeter you are correct l the distance the distance around the circle
well then that is your fault not hers out now the formula to find circumference you either know it or you know a trick or you do not know it
right and if you know the trick by the time you use the trick 5 times you know the formula d pi times diameter is that the whole formula no i am thinking about circumference you are missing something what am i missing
circumference equals a pi times diameter you need the whole thing diameter who is still at this point relying on the word trick you are like i need the word trick to remember it because i do not have that memorized yet
trick cherry pie is delicious cherry pie is delicious you can use it once twice or forever matter no because as long as you get the right answer that is all that is needed needed nobody knows whether or not you are using a pneumonic device or if you have the formula memorized and do they really care
no there is more than one way to skin a cat and there is more than one way to do math and we take them all in here now my last group got into some really important cool information about diameter and radius
relationship i am going to draw you a nice circle cause i know that drawing a circle sometimes for you all is hard
it that is the radius and diameter is twice the radius so write d equals twice the radius so how would i write that 2 times r
good now if instead of knowing like you said that you know the radius diameter what if i know the diameter and not the radius what do i do then that so i am looking to find the radius
so r equals it is that is okay here just rewrite it because it is not wanting to cooperate
you know r equals now i have the eraser work seriously there you go
attention very good baby if i do not know the diameter but i know the radius i multiply radius times 2 and i get the diameter diameter if i know the diameter but i do not know the radius i divide it by 2 to get the radius
formula yes now what i really want you to do tonight for homework beside your spiral is to go home and explain this formula and how it all works to your parent
my mom your mom needs help i will not tell her that when i see her at basketball i will not tell her that but explain it to em tell them the trick for cherry pie is delicious trick how many of you think your parents are going to need a trick to remember it cause they do not know it
so that is what i would like for you all to do tonight is teach your parents what you learned today i know some of your parents know it but show them how you are learning it different that and i can guarantee nobody is parents learned this in 5th grade spiral we have already looked at your spiral so there should not be any questions about it
back i apologize it was not copied correctly but when it was in at the printer it just did not want to work work no cause you are going to staple the other one in the back
right today we are going to start with our hands on equation lesson 6 and we are going to need to get our materials boards if you will get 6 bags of manipulatives for your table
if you will get 6 bags for your table 5 bags rather and if you can get 5 bags for your table we will begin
as usual go ahead and get out your blue pawns and your red dye leaving the white pawns and the green dye in your bags
still yes sir you do not have enough pawns there should be 6 per bag
i have 8 is it 8 yes give one from yours and one from yours 7 we will take one from this bag for now
right we are going to solve equations today
what numbers equal signs and algebraic equations have mixed numbers and it has been a while
variable the number of how many what does it mean if it is a variable it went replaces the actual letter the actual number will replace the letter
it is easier to hear you if you take your hand off your mouth now if it is an equation it is going to be constant but if it is an expression variables can change right correct it has been a while since we had math
tell i am going to put an equation on the board and i want you to tell me what is special about this equation
what is special about this equation it is new and different from last time we did hands on equations what is different you have your those little things parenthesis those are new are not they
t you do what is inside them 1st you do what is inside them 1st okay what is that when you think about parenthesis doing that 1st
huh order of operations right now if you are thinking of order of operations who knows what you do 1st
parenthesis parenthesis and then what figure out exponents is my book gone it it is a blue book with an owl on the front morning a blue book yes
ahead just ask for a blue book just tell her i need my pneumonic device book right there is a great pneumonic device to help with order of operations and we will talk about that in a minute
while he has gone getting that what do you think this means you are supposed to do try doing it with your pawns on your board
means you may not be able to explain it yet but see if you can show me what it means mister c says she is in the computer lab on her shelf there is a book and it is a blue baby blue book and it has owls on the front
ledge remember whatever it is that you were trying to show me should be facing the ceiling if you are trying to show a 3 it should be facing the ceiling
right we are not right but that is okay sir i know what x equals okay you know what x equals but we have got to be able to show it on our boards correctly because that is not right
what it means is let us see if i can show you if you will see it yes that is how you should show this on your board
favor fix your board so that yours looks like mine can you see it
it it is still just really just
book i know it was in my other book that walked away at one point
what did it mean have i have x +3 so it means i am multiplying x +3 how many times
2 twice okay equals x +8 means now pemdas this is where we were leading and i was looking for the pneumonic device that went with it in one of my books but i just do not see it
so p is parenthesis e is exponents m multiplication d divide a add subtract okay that is the order of operations and those of you that are in here know what exponents are from our previous from last week
so you will do what is in here 1st but in order to do that you have to know what it means it means x +32 times i put x +32 times because i do not know what the x is yet i am still going to do the same thing i need to do before
board what should i do do i want xs on one side and numbers on the other do
take an x off that side take an x from the side okay so that is a balanced move correct do take so i will take this 3 and 8 -3 is 5
t take 3 away from 5 take 3 away from 5 and i get 2 2 now i could have simply taken 6 from 8 instead of 3 and then 3
well now you are telling me that x equals 2 that when i go back to check it i actually plug in 2 for the x thank you wake up
now using order of operations what do i do 1st too i do parenthesis 1st correct so 2 +3 is 5 10 2 times 5 is 10 equals 10
does okay yes madam so in the parenthesis when you have a 3 is it sort of like 3 to the 2nd power no if it was 3 to the 2nd power 3 to the 2nd power would be as an exponent so no 9 exponents you see no exponents up here none correct
okay let me give you another example
please i am really disappointed this book did not have it
september it has an entire section devoted to math and it tells you tricks in remembering your times tables how to remember roman numerals long division fractions decimals percents
you know all the word tricks i give you like cherry pie is delicious and all those kinds of things
devices anyways it is a good book
okay stop for a minute if i were just writing this 2 x +one what would you put on your board 2 pawns and the number one okay that would be correct
now if i said you are going to multiply that by 2 that means you are going to put 2 pawns and the number one how many times 2 twice that is all it means so it is 2 pawns +12 pawns +one equals 18
now i can condense these 21s here correct one +one is 2 so i can go ahead and slide these together and do that and make that change like that
18 what do i do here is can i figure it out yet
i have to do something before i can decide what each x is going to equal down what do i do i what is my goal to get what okay i need to find out what my x equals but i have got to make some moves
moving if i take a pawn from this side is there a pawn on this side to take it and make it a balanced move
do where do i have a balanced move where if i move it from one side i can move it from the other out you have to take 2 away from 18 take 2 from this side right then take 2 from 18
16 now i have 4 xs equals 16 4 so x equals 4 that is what our manipulatives are telling us that x equals 4 now if i go back in and plug it in it is going to work but i want to show you the math here
if i say 2 times 2 x what do i get 2 times 2 4 2 times one
2 is not that what i had when i was here
then i did this correct are you seeing it then i said 4 times some number equals 16 so i know i can divide 4 by 4 and get one so it cancels
16 divided by 4 is x equals 4 so there is the math that explains this math how many of you were saying i am going to need these manipulatives to do it though
okay one more example and then i am going to pass out our daily work and our review from our previous
yay okay up do me a favor
set up just what is in the parenthesis how many times should you do that again you put your 2nd x but you also have to put a 2nd no
you have got x +4 so you have got to put x +4 again okay then at the end of that side of the equation is a plus x so you need another okay do you have it
is i prefer you wait until you show me because this is tricky still you have your x +4 times 2 yes you have got it
it you have got it here put x +4 on your board
again x +4 again you did x +4 now do it again 4 do another 4
no no you were picking up your pawns now this look it is x +4 the 1st time x +4 the 2nd time plus x that no
watch okay x +4 everybody at this table put x +4 on your board solve get out a piece of paper and do the math
4 okay then at the x +4
x okay 4 it says plus x so now you have to have a plus x at the end
that now you can put it all together so you have got 3 xs +8 but we do not have an 8 cube moves setting it up is the tricky part
with what do you have you can move
you want to get all of your xs on one side and all of your pawns on the other so you can move right so if i take this pawn from here i am going to take that pawn from there right
8 so 2 x equals 8 4 okay up you have got x +4 x +4 plus x
you have 18 right x sorry x +16 okay you want to get your xs on one side and pawns on the other you take one pawn from here and one pawn from there
now here i have my pawns and i have my die over here so i want to get rid of these guys 8 so 2 xs equals 8
4 okay
either show me how you got your answer and i have got to see you getting an answer
work am i supposed to do this did i see your work yet though you did okay you can not go on to your hands on equations worksheet until i see your work from the last one okay all right everybody really quick
i know some of you have moved on to the hands on equations sheet but you need to wait
you have to go back to this one that is on the board because lots of you solved it correctly but i want to make sure you solved the math side of it because you solved it a little differently which as long as it is the correct answer we are cool x +4 x +4 plus x equals x +16 okay
means x +4 x +4 plus x now if i write this out mathematically 2 x +8 plus x equals x +16
side so 2 x plus x is how many xs is that guys 3 x +8 equals x +16
is 3 x +8 equals x +16 is so then i took the pawn from this side and i took it from this side with a balanced move
now i have pawns on one side and xs on the other but still numbers on the other these so if i take 8 from here i have to take 8 from here 8 so 2 x equals 8
so i subtract x subtract x 2 x +8 equals 16 4 4 because 2 divided by 2 is one
4 x equals 4 right some of you all went back and showed me all these random boards to check but you did not show me this wanting when i say show me the math this is what i am wanting to see i am not wanting to see the check i am wanting to see the math
okay now if i go back in how many of you this is what you showed me for your math check that is not what i am wanting to see
too yes i do but this would be parenthesis 1st 2 times 8 is 16 and that checks so really you have got to be able to do both parts the math and the check
now is it okay that some of us are still relying on our hands on equations and our manipulatives right everyone has lesson 6 worksheet in front of you
go ahead and set up number one everyone set up number one yes solve
solve i want to see your boards before you solve problem remember this should be facing the ceiling not you careful solve
confused solve
one you can not go ahead and not do the work and the check
ahead all right
the math here how do you do it
these move them okay so you are going to take 6 from there 6 from here is 4 right so each one equals 2
reason when you move them here you will start remembering to move them on paper okay otherwise that inverse operation i am wanting you to do you will not do it there either you will just look at the problem and see the answer and while you can see it here up there could you see that no so you see why i want you to work it all the way out
one if i look at my board okay i have x +3 x +3 because x +3 times 2 is 2 x +6 equals 10
now if i do this 2 xs 3 +3 is 6 right here i have combined together i need numbers on one side other i have 2 pawns over here 2 pawns over here so i leave my pawns alone
i need to take this 6 and subtract right 4 that means that 2 xs equals 4
here cancels 2 x equals 0 that was subtract 4 so each x equals no 4 so how much does one x equal 2 2 x equals 2 math okay
now i needed the check and the check is when i go back in and plug it in correct so 2 +3 is 5 2 times 5 is 10 equals 10
yes how many of you all got this no problem
it after number 2 i am going to send you on your way if you have got it to work and if you do not we are going to do small group good let me see that you are good what you got
it when your board is set up for number 2 raise your hand good solve i told you all you all could go that whole table
solve what do you mean this is the check because you have plugged in for x when you have plugged in a number for x that is the check
you are you not positive be +positive you subtracted wrong what is 3 and 3 it no 6 9 -6 is 3
it is okay go solve come on t does not it feel good to be +positive is way better than i think show me
good you had it the check remember the check is where you go in and you plug in wherever x is
2 so wherever you see x in this problem you plug in the 3 so you rewrite the problem but wherever there is an x you put a 3 there and then you solve it
doing you know how to do it it is not a race no we are not sure about number 3 i think it is 4 2 i thought it would be one because show me what you have
be 4 x +2 times 3 is 2 times 3 is 6 6 is not that easier if you do that ahead of time instead of thinking 2 x +one or 2 x +one it that is for 4 right as long as it checks
it it checks show me your check on you got your check go on
on you got your check go on problem somehow you have got the right answer but you do not have it written correctly
k all right i am stealing this pen right 2 times x +3 equals 9 plus x so then where did you decide it equaled 3 do you have to set up your board all over again for me
me okay move these out of the way because these now go ahead then i added okay and i subtracted 9 by 6 whoa whoa whoa put that back what did you do
i subtracted 9 by 6 so if you took 9 from here where are you going to take 9 from other if i take 9 from here can i take 9 from here
here so if i take 6 from here i need to take 6 from here 3 so 9 -6 is 3 now i have 2 x equals 3 plus x
so i still have an x and numbers together yeah huh and that
3 now what that looks like now 2 times x is 2 x +2 times 3 is 6 equals 9 plus x right so 6 -6 is 0
side 9 -6 is 3 3 we were left with 2 x equals 3 plus x right it so x minus x is cancel minus x 2 x minus x is 0
no if i have 2 xs and i take one of them away i have one 3 that is the math okay now if i do my check all i am doing you see where this x is
3 since there is an x there i am going to put a 3 it says order of operations i do whatever is in the parenthesis so 3 +3 is 6
and 9 +3 is 12 works okay that is how that works back this check is not correct because how did you get 5 inside the parenthesis you have to show
this you have to show me where this x equals 2 2 you have to start from the very beginning which is here in set up your board for this one for number 3 and i will come back
right keep on trucking it is all right as long as you figure it out 20 minutes is fine 2nd hang on a 2nd 2 x
no one like this ah one okay
that that is it this if i go ahead and i say 2 times 2 is 4 here one 2 3 4 xs 2 is not that a lot easier yes it is
a lot easier you got the check and that is the important part it as long as you are getting the check i am good for now okay now all right 5 4 3 2 one
one through 4 is all new work and i know not everyone got through one through 4 5 through 10 is what we have done before homework if you do not have one through 4 finished not a huge deal now you need to put your manipulatives back in the bags pass them to the person that gave them to you and pass your boards down to the end of the row
those if you know you are going to need manipulatives for homework you need to come check them out from me at the end of the day okay that means you will be responsible for returning them or paying for them all right it number 4 i do not get it
number 4 let me see your pencil i am stealing it 4 x +2 times 3 is 2 times 6 6 equals x +9
okay so now i take one from this side and one from this side 3 there was a one and then a 3 last time did i do not know you showed me show me how you did it
2 and then 4 then there is a one 2 then x then 9
3 yeah 0 sorry it is supposed to be a 6 6 it should be a 3 and that one should be a 3
you could but see 2 xs +3 twice it is 2 x +3 2 x +3 2 x +3 wrong what would have been a not smart thing would be to keep going knowing it was wrong right
c an improper fraction it s an improper fraction and what we want to do is we want to turn it into what type of number number we want to turn it into a mixed number why is this called an improper fraction m because the numerator is bigger than the denominator because what
the numerator is bigger than the numerator is larger than the denominator so we want to turn them into a mixed number do what do we need to do to turn this into a mixed number we need to figure out how many can you get how many what fourths can you get out of that how many fourths can we get out of 9 in other words how many sets of 4s can we get out of the number 9 and based on us knowing our multiplication facts how many sets of 4s can we get out of the number 9
2 so we can get 2 whole 4s out of the number 9 how many do we have left over after we get our 2 whole 4s out of there how many are left over that s not the right one yeah it is this one says one thing sorry he gave me the wrong 11 i thought it looked familiar from yesterday but let s move on
so now the same concept but this is 13 halves we want to ask ourselves how many 2s can we get out of what 13 in other words how many sets of 2s can we get out of 13 k we can get how many
it we want to try to get as close as possible it yes i said before you holler out think about it time okay do we have anything left over
many how many do we have here how many do we have left over after that we have 21s left over over somebody help her out
one
t she said we get 6 wholes we already know that told us that so how many do we have left over from that think about what you re looking at
how many go over there cause she s doing the same thing go so we get 6 wholes and what do we have left so really we have one left and then you just bring your denominator here and you get 6 and one half
now how do we figure out how to bring that back into an improper fraction how do we change that back into an improper fraction what do we need to do do 6 times 2 and then so i m going to put 6 times 2 thing so i put that and took the 13 halves which is an improper fraction does everybody get that it s not hard at all
simplification this is simplifying this boys and girls changing an improper fraction into a mixed number okay one the next one says $10 subtract $3.75
$3.75 boys and girls you have to line up your decimals so if you line up your decimals when you bring it down it will look similar to this so when you subtract what do i need to do
3 okay he said i m doing exactly what he said 7 okay so now take the 7 and turn it into 6 because 750 so i m going to 7 and turn it into 6
now what that s hundredths so 100 -75 will give you he did it like this right yes how can we check that to make sure that s correct okay so we re going to add these back together i know 5 +5 is how much
2 +2 okay here that s 4 +6 minus very good yes and i know other people have different ways but we need to move on cause there s other ways you can do it it the next one says find the quotient this is the next one
we re doing this one find the quotient we want to know what the quotient is that what do we call this number
number dividend dividend very good so what will we call the number that we re looking for once again top so we need to find the quotient so there s a couple ways we can do it but we want to do it the way that we ve been talking about
side we know we re trying to get this as close to 193 as possible without going over so already i m going to start multiplying 7 times 20 140 that s 14th so i have 14th so now say okay that s close but that s not close enough 7 times 30 210 so 210 seems to be over
no so which one would i want to use again quotient i put the quotient up top and then when i multiply the quotient by the divisor divisor the dividend is underneath here the divisor how much would that be again so i need to subtract boys and girls i m subtracting a whole 140 from 193 the whole number
and once i subtract that i know that s going to give me 3 and that s going to be 5 again we learned we take the new dividend and we re going to put the new dividend up top 53 and we re going to divide the 7 into the new dividend so if i divide 7 into 53 how many 7s or sets of 7s can i get out of 53 7 he said i can get 7
and i know based on my multiplication facts i know that 7 times 7 is 49 right yes and when i subtract that all again i need to subtract that whole 49 from 53 what would that be 49 from 53 4 now do i have to continue no
d you can stop because your answer is smaller than your because now my answer is called my what remainder but because my remainder is smaller than my divisor i can stop together when i add 20 and 7 that will be what
27 so the answer is 27 remainder 3 that i can stop because my remainder is smaller model it says use the rectangle model to find the product the product is 45 times 17
we re trying to find we re multiplying 45 times 17 to get our answer so we re going to do a rectangular model up how would i break that up up you put 40 +5
5 tell me the other number how would i break that up 7 10 +7 and boys and girls i know my facts and because i know my facts i know that if i multiply 40 times 10 that s going to give me 400 then i know if i multiply 10 times 5 that s 50 then i m going to do the same thing up here
so i m going to put my 40 here and my 5 here and my 10 here and my 7 here and that s just to remind me what i need to multiply next if i multiply 7 times 40 that will be 280 right and if i multiply 5 times 7 because i know my facts it s 35
inside so if i add 400 +280 +50 +35 what would that total be k okay let s see we ve got all the way 000 +5 is 5
13 8 and 5 is 13 right yes +3 is how much 16 so i put the 6 down here this is in my 10s column and i m going to carry this whole one over here and when i add 4 +2 that will be how much
square you should have did it in a 4 square form square it says connie put 4 apples in a basket let s re read it basket how many apples did she use all together the top part says so what am i trying to find out
out somebody tell me what i m trying to find out d how many apples did she use all together we want to know how many she used all together it says how many apples did she use all together so how many
and i m going to say these are apples okay apples then there s something else i want to find out because i want to figure out how you do this so something else i want to find out is what what else do i want to find out
but i want to find out what i want to find out the what how many apples she used yes but i need to find out what am i going to have to add multiply subtract or divide that s what i need to find out whether i have to add let s go back to it again together it says once again connie put 4 apples in each basket
how many apples did she have to use all together all together all together so we re talking about all together 1st of all you see the basket model is here so if we re talking about all together what are we talking about are we talking about adding multiplying are we talking about subtracting or are we talking about dividing what are we talking about multiplication and you can do addition addition
but what s quicker multiplication multiplication that s why we multiply because multiplication is easier so if she put 4 apples in each one of these in each basket so now i have how many baskets do i have
12 i have 12 baskets
4 so that s truly probably a multiplication problem so i said well i think i ve got to multiply so just so i can remember i m going to say 12 baskets times 4 and i m going to go up here and make me a model and my model s going to look like this because it s easy for me to figure that out that i can do 10 and then i can do 2 and then i can do 4
so that s what i want to do cause i don t have anything else there cause i want to figure out what the answer is based on this so now i did it all you did it another way and there s nothing wrong with that as long as you get the right answer right yes okay
out we re solving there right so how can i solve it how can i get the answer how do i come up with the answer okay
okay then you multiply 4 times one asking 4 times 10 how much is that
4 and you know what one we just need the so we don t need this then what s 2 times 4 8 and then if i add the 2 together what would that be 48 so how many does she have all together 48 48 is your answer then over there you re just justifying how would i justify this
it goes like a rectangle and then you put a so it looks like a long square okay but we just said we ve got to use this part
we re only going to do it like this you know what i m talking about you re talking about like this yeah we re going to do it like that so that means this part is you got that very good excellent okay one through 10 put them up
11 through 21 you all just keep yours right there you don t move not for this
can okay remember yesterday we were talking about we re still talking about fractions but we want to do something a little different today
we re learning about fractions but we want to use it on a number line remember yesterday we was finding the least common denominator and the least common multiple
yesterday we was doing some least common multiples and least common denominators
24 what s after that 32 48 and we said we wanted to go at least to 5 places to see where we are
okay based on that if we were looking for the least common multiple for these numbers what number would it be be what number would it be it the least common multiple for both of them there you go 8 so we can say that the least common multiple for 4 and 8 is what 8
everybody got that cause i put the extra one there for the 8 cause i forgot the 8 needs to be picked up too too the next one let s find the least common multiple
me let s do the 5s 1st next we re going to do 5s and 10s like this so we can have it 25 right here 30 40 50
okay so what would be the least common multiple for the 5 and 10 the least common multiple that means that both of them can go into it an equal number of times
20 but we want to find the least common is 10 larger than 20
conversation ready it let s go ahead and do 6 and 12 right now cause we know they re going to be one cause 6 times one is 6 and 12 times one is 12
24 next 60 huh 60 what s the least common what s the least common multiple over here 12
12 is your least common multiple does everybody see that now let s look at the least common denominator say we wanted to do we re solving unlike fractions right 4 i want to add them based on this in order for me to do it i want to find the least common denominator or least common multiple multiples when we count by a certain number
so based on this looking at this what do i need to do based on how we did it yesterday this so what do i need to do you have to figure out how many times can 5 go into 2
okay can i do this can i say well based on this i m going to up here and do my least common multiple 25 25 we re going to stop there then what s this one 50 okay
so based on this what is the least common multiple for this thing numbers so i already know but in order for me to get 10 here i need to take and multiply this by what 10 if i multiply this by 10 and that by 10 so what do i need to multiply by one who said it
one so if i multiply by one here i need to multiply by one here cause i want this denominator to be 10 10 now i need to do the same thing i need the denominator to be 10 what do i need to multiply by both of these by in order to get the denominator to be 10
c okay i m listening to you one and one half what did i say about that what did we end up saying about that yesterday that the denominator exactly so when you are multiplying them together they have to be the same
so in other words in order for me to make them the same what do i need to multiply both by 2 so that means i need to multiply my numerator by 2 and my denominator be 6 tenths 6 tenths and i think on your quiz on friday i asked you to make that smaller how can i make that smaller cause that s what you have to do
in order to make it smaller cause you can make it you ve got to look at the factors of 6 the factors of 10 in other words what numbers can i multiply together to get 10 6 so let s look at the factors so we have 6 and we have 10 with factors of 10
2 so i can go 2 and 3 are factors anything else anything else i can multiply by and get 6 thing i don t need to be writing that anything else can i multiply that and get 6 6 it s already there anything else 3 times 2 it s already there 2.5 we re not going to go there
now so we ve got all our factors for 6 right now let s look at our factors for 10 10 all the numbers that i can multiply together to get 10 i can do 2 and i can do 5 10 i can do one and 10 one and 10
now boys and girls other than one because when i multiply one by anything when i multiply one by anything it s going to always come out to that number further what s the next number that s there that are alike other than one in the small
here once again i finished doing my factoring i m asking you what numbers other than one are in both of them that s the next smallest number that will be common to both 5 and 10 20 do you see that up there do you see that up there re think it
do you see that up there where i m over here what numbers other than one are common to both of those factors that s small the next smallest number other than one 2 so boys and girls now i know okay i ve got a 2 here
know now all i ve got to do is divide my 6 by 2 and my 10 by 2 cause i m making it small now be in other words what number can i multiply by 2 to get 6
thing what number can i multiply by 10 i mean by 2 and get 10 5 so boys and girls based on this i know that that is in the simplest form
so that s why i know 6 tenths and i know 3 fifths are equivalent or they re the same does everybody got that we understand equivalent means the same we do
that teacher c s room bye we understand that they are the same right
today that was just a review of finding common or least common denominator you know this was the way that we found the least common denominator the other way we did the least common what multiple we counted by multiples of 5 and multiples of 10 we do it all the time on the calendar what are we counting by on this one multiples of what
not what are we counting by on the calendar this time 7s that means every time you see 7 we count by multiples of 7 what s up there that s multiples of 70 there s 7 days in a week
he probably don t have them all up there but do you see them up there okay now what i want you to do we want to talk about fractions on number lines today just tell me a little bit about what you know about number lines
m i can t hear you we have one on our okay we have one somebody else somebody different
a it s a line of numbers it s a line of numbers a they what they count by certain ways they count by certain ways
anything else about a number line that they re counting in the least common denominator they count by is that kind of sort of what she just said
j the one that we re doing in the room is based on that anything else that you know about a number line m just number lines in general not necessarily the one in the room but any number line right okay so what else sometimes there are patterns in number lines okay
lines so i just wanted to see that you know some patterns in number lines here now what i want you to do is i want you to open up your book to page 401 401 page 401
then once you get to 401 i want you to look at the number line
line it s at the top of the page of your paper of your textbooks now what i want you to do is we re going to work together and we re going to compare and contrast the fraction bar along with the number line and tell me what i mean and i want you to talk to your shoulder partner about it
tell me what i m talking about when i say compare and contrast talk to your shoulder partner and then i ll just call on you you re a b c a b c a b a b c a b a b b is 1st talk to your shoulder partner about what do i mean when i say compare and contrast
contrast talk to your shoulder partner bs go 1st
that s right a b c go 1st okay
go ahead you can do it like in an example okay how would you compare yourself with your classmates are you all around the same age
okay think about that another compare would be what what class same classroom same grade what would be a contrast with you and your classmate do you all have the same birthday okay what else what else could be a contrast a big contrast
yeah you have different cultures okay some what some are boys and some are girls that s right some are boys some are girls
okay what else that s contrasting that would be different right anything else you all use different words okay that would be contrasting they use different language some of you are bilingual that means you speak 2 languages bi means 2 not that way
bi means 2 that means you speak spanish and you speak english okay got that some people speak more than that i don t know what they call that trilingual i guess you speak more english but you can speak spanish a little or a lot
it a little a little okay now the next thing she says she doesn t feel good she s going to throw up
okay now i want the as you share bs listen and if you have a c partner we re going to allow for about one more minute for the c partner to share it with share
sharing bs and cs are listening then we re going to allow one more minute for the c to share as well
okay stop
now we re going to actually compare the fraction bar and the number line
with your face partner compare okay i want you to look at your number line and i want you to look at that fraction bar and compare them different we re looking at this and we re looking at that what makes them alike
what makes them different is because this is a number line and this is a fraction bar okay another thing i realized is this goes through 0 one 2 3 4 and this one stays one one one one
the denominator on this is 4 4 4 4 and this is 4 4 4 4 and if you look at this right here it s the same so which one is the number line this one the one that okay and this is your fraction bar but it s still the same amount broken
what on a number line all of them are so this will start at 0 fourths and then this will be 14th so that will be what and if you do the number line if you do your fraction bar that s 14th still and then when you put these together it s going to be what these 22 fourths that s right and then when you put 3 of them together it s going to be what 3 fourths is that the same thing
yep and then you put them all together it s going to be what 4 fourths or what one whole one whole does everybody see that this equals 14th 2 fourths 3 fourths 4 fourths it is the same they are now look at these number lines as you go down to the bottom these number lines are divided to show different fractions
do you see that yes so this right here is showing a number line and what you re going to have to do is okay boys and girls listen up stop we have already looked at our fraction bar and our number line and we have compared right yes okay
yes both of them are broken up into what person if you know raise your hand one person s fractions i want something a little bit more than fractions yes they re broken up into fractions but it s a type of fraction m fourths they are broken up into fourths very important
do you see other number lines that are underneath yes what i m going to do is i m going to listen paper we are going to make these other 3 number lines you will do them separately okay
cut are we listening yes ma am and then you re going to work together in your group and create the other number lines and fill in the missing letter that means which fraction is missing from that number line
doing and i ll be circling the room we re not looking for perfectness but we want to at least be neat
making how many number lines are we making how many number lines are we making 3 we are making how many one 2 3 that i m going to start you off with that okay i got that
right now i need you to create your own number line go ahead you need to go
you didn t listen okay now i need you to be quiet because i m still teaching and that s not serious because i can get somebody to be your partner
you need to calm down yes you do have math homework why are you up where were you when i said to get scissors where were you some where were you when i said everybody get scissors sit down here
you re only doing 3
homework okay go
go get them i should see 3 strips for a number line
evenly cut as evenly as you can make them okay as evenly as you can get it
you re having a lot of side barring that means conversation that you should not be having
and then once you ve cut your strips off you will do this ones yes you do
help it s in your book
your job is once you have finished doing that you are making these separate number lines yep okay you have 3 strips to make 3 separate number lines that s what you re doing you re making that one that one and that one just copy it
okay i can t see it
yes right now we write it
yes please make sure you re writing my metric length book on the front
did you grab one of those we started already yeah i just wanted to staple it
this is supposed to open like a book a book doesn t open like that it opens like this put this inside 0 you already put one inside
inside all right all this needs to be out of the way
floor this i m tired of seeing on here so put it in your binder or in your book bag what is this did you grab papers from here
missing did you grab one and not the rest put that inside put that inside did you all put your papers inside can you close that and put it on the floor we re starting and your name s supposed to be on that as well and you could be sitting there and drawing stuff on it if you want
please put your papers inside it while we re waiting while i come around and staple it if you want to add some pictures to it but your name needs to be on it as well
how do you spell belong b e g belong belongs s
of course i run out of staples hold on
okay please be ready for me to be ready to come around and staple so i can staple it real fast
all right while i m stapling you need to in the bucket on your table there s some string which i will tell you what to do with in a 2nd so you re not going to touch the string and there are some unit cubes and there are some rods in there
each person needs one cube and one rod so if you want to take those out of the bucket so you have that in front of you one cube and one rod
come move up and join table 4 with your book and those papers that i told you to erase from because you weren t supposed to start
and the pencil you have your pencil okay all right we also need a piece of string but in a 2nd i m going to show you how the string needs to be cut
all right we need to cut the string to a certain length and we are going to use the rod to tell us how much we want to cut okay
no we are going to cut it the length of 10 of those so what you re going to do is everybody s watching we need to make our string as long as 10 of these
no so what you re going to do is this is going to set on your table and you re going to hold the string from the end to here that s one here i start that at the other end that s 23 four . does that make sense
yeah 5678910 after 10 cut right there okay so this is where did i get this from mine so here is a string that is about 10 of these okay
so you re going to make one of these for yourself pass the string and a pair of scissors to somebody else at your table so they can make one okay ahead no can help somebody
on all right keep get it and then pass it t it doesn t have to be perfect it is easier if you set this down and do it like that okay
while you re waiting if you want to continue to decorate your front of your book is . that s not 3
0 he bit the off why would you do that
it didn t come that . cut cut right here yes are you done hm i just started she just got it
one no you did it right okay here now put your other finger . don t go too long
here what stop this is 3 okay okay again 4 no that was still 3 now that s 4
start thinking about what we can measure with these different pieces these different lengths in your head you can measure the tv with this you can measure the computer screen you can measure the sides of missus h yes it s actually a baby shower game
what they do is they take string and they pass the string around i get to hold on her belly s small well put it down on the biggest part put it right there okay hold tight your belly got big over night it did get big over night
okay think about what you could measure with each one of these sizes brainstorm because you ll be writing some stuff down in a 2nd
can you people feel your belly kick yet
the baby kick it s not strong enough yet
i ll do it so it gets done quickly 3 shh 5 with the scissors right here look at it you guys give the scissors so he can cut
in the middle cut thank you cut this let me see your string okay count give me your scissors all right
minute let me get string for this table all the other tables should be pretty much done put it in the so
missus
okay this string the leftover string and the scissors need to go back in the basket put the ruler back we re not touching it right now are we all done yes okay
make sure the leftover string and the scissors are back in the basket now we are going to open we re not thinking about the string right now put the string in front of you and pick up your little unit piece okay
and you re going to open to the 1st page and you re going to think about just yourself without talking for just a few seconds it says these things are about as long as a blank rod write green in there because you have a green piece of a rod so write green right here yeah i was going to write it in for you but originally we were using something else and they were all different colors and now we re using these and everybody has green
so write green and green on the blank spot and then i want you to brainstorm right here please 05 things and you list them out on your paper that are about the size of that green unit
anywhere on your body in the room in your house in the world think this size not things that are square things that are that size now you can use something that is 3 d we re not touching the rulers
me 0 i ve got one okay it does it could be something 3 d 3 dimensional like this or it could be something the size of one of the sides like a square no you can t say a square because a square can be all different sizes what i m saying is my pinky nail is about the size of this side
shh so to yourself brainstorm and write down 5 things d that are about the size of the small piece one okay put the long one down and only have the small one in your hand
let s not relate it to that yet just only that size at i don t know some people are moving along and some people have nothing just think to yourself without speaking
we re going to talk about it in just a 2nd but right now i want you to not talk about it don t put your pencil on it don t poke your pencil in it don t put your nail in it you will make permanent dents in these things
hand close your eyes think about what is something that size or close to it it doesn t have to be exact
it can you what yeah how do you spell mosquito m 0 s q u i t 0 like if you have a corn
that same as . any kind of corn yeah okay about when i asked you not to talk and i see you talking i know you re not following directions
shh if you so happen to have some of the same things and we discuss it fine but right now you re thinking on your own
it doesn t have to be square thinking i m thinking of a kind of what you were thinking of a what
size shh desk because you re the only one who s playing with it like they shouldn t be
a diamond and a ring yeah could this be a the side and the front right here it could be everybody s different sized teeth i don t know mine s little all right
have look within your table i m talking now so you re done look within your table and whisper within your table so we don t get too loud of what you each have at your table and see maybe you could put a star or a circle circle the number by the ones that you have that are the same as somebody else at your table okay
talk within your table and if you all have any that are the same you can circle them or put a star by the number or circle the number
i don t understand why that looks like that when i said you should have one of each and that is it
group what do you all have i got s finger s finger like where s finger so the top part of his finger
a centimeter and a this shouldn t be here because i told you not to use the ruler those are the size of the square right there that little square down huh let s see . do you all have any that are the same
then you should be putting a circle by it or a star by it to show which ones you have the same do you have any that are the same is it star that are far away and a capital star is big right what
map yeah that ll fit but it s got to be real little don t it 0 that s just on the map to locate it for you say 0 the face on the poster
okay what about some other different things that you don t see right here fingernail okay but you should be circling or putting stars by the ones that you all have that are the same and if you see some other good ones on others you can fill in the rest of yours okay let s come back and be quiet shh come back and be quiet sit up
raise your hand if you want to tell me from your table what are some things you had similar with other people at your table dime maybe close small a blueberry a blueberry
maybe is it the side of the piece eraser 0 yeah that is one e a ring a ring you think you have a ring the size of that okay a chocolate chip
chip the top of s finger the top part of s finger up here my finger too though and many people s fingers j a diamond a diamond could be that size shh listen a pinky toe okay
part you already did on one okay some people their front teeth their front tooth is the same okay what about i know has one that says psp button
he was thinking about stuff at home the psp button i put ps one too now i really like the one that s the pinky nail it this is something that you can remember and you can kind of if you didn t have a cube to figure out a measurement
down put it down out of your hands hands you can use your pinky to measure something if you don t have a ruler handy right page now we re not going to do the back of that page 1st it copied wrong
we re going to do the page that has this the picture of the rod 1st green so it says these things are about as long as a green rod so hold the rod in your hand this time not the unit and brainstorm a few things that are about that size by yourself
do not talk to anyone about what you are writing keep it secret and then when i let you know you can share it with your group shh keep it secret do your best on the spelling
hear i m not going to give you that long on this one because your brain s already working so you should be able to think of some things
missus h what what do you call that thing when that s way longer than the rod
rod that thing for the blinds is that what you re talking about long what do you call the little sticky things to help put stuff like that magnet yeah that you cut it in
okay i was comparing to this 0 you mean that green roll of it that i have i hear some people talking and they shouldn t be
0 okay don t compare it to just one person and you ll find out why later things that you see 4 something that you have at home
c a m a r a a r a right here hm i brushed my teeth last night for about an hour doing it should be e r a with an e
up like that end like a k yeah that s right i can t look upside down it s messing me up
table shh brainstorm what you have with your table and put a circle or star
if you didn t get all 5 things and you like an idea that somebody has you can add that in
really hey that s mine maybe you can use something about okay let s not use anymore okay and you ll know why in a minute okay
because what we re coming up with now is going to help us for later for when we don t have things to measure and are we going to have s face to lay down and measure against something for the rest of our lives
no no okay you could even do things like this is like almost half of a nametag or something like that or almost half it would be half of this white part right
i m done i have 3 things of of a what cd maybe that d be a good guess can t get that down why it s tied up there and i m not climbing up
have shh do you have anything on this one that matched a your face where right here how about your nose what about your forehead forehead you re just counting from this part of her face
sideburn the face a clinic pass a what yes but i chose okay a pencil
no so your current pencil may be that length right a marker a marker a computer mouse a computer mouse k how about a smart board eraser cane a candy cane a letter okay
yes a worm a worm maybe yes leaf worm too you both did worms m the word presidents if you wrote it out
z magnet tape magnet tape okay now we re moving onto this page right before it the one we skipped over and now everybody each table is going to have a different color written down because we re talking about your string
so it says these things are about as long as 10 rods and you write green rods and then underneath you write the color of your string no write green there because that says 10 green rods because how many rods did it take to make our string
1010 underneath that in parenthesis you can write red string or blue string or green string or black string right here no on the back of the 1st one you did did shh there shouldn t be any talking
yeah and then write black string and list 5 things that are about the length of your string p 3 it s a what s it called again the thing that you p 3 yeah playstation 3 it s a you re playstation 3 is as long as that string yeah no
no it s shorter i think i m a little bit short you re what i think this is a little bit too short it s about put down and think no s not always going to be the same size
size i would put a pregnant man or lady but a l l e s 2 l s and it s a misses in front of that
how do you spell pregnant p r e g n a n t n t
up i want to see if you re tall i m not going to be the same size as she s not always going to be the same size okay what was i writing you should be at your table brainstorming
moment you re brainstorming shh okay let s not use people
no he is not always going to be that size your hair s not as long as long as the string okay i i need you all to be focusing more on what i m asking you to do because some of you are getting off track you re walking around the room getting out of your seat talking to other tables
you should be thinking of things you see in your world at home in school that could be as long or about as close to the length of your string
do you think a playstation cord could be that long do you think a playstation cord could be that long 0 v e n shh like justin bieber do you have anything written down
2 all right we re going over this now because i see people who are playing and their talking about things that aren t supposed to be
all right brainstorm with your table see if you have any of the same . around my head once around your head really
your head s the same size as this okay a pregnant lady s belly is an example an or a big book i don t think a book could be that big
those big books you use when you re in 1st grade 2nd grade 0 yeah a bookshelf a white board cabinets chair and refrigerator your refrigerator is that size yeah the small refrigerator 0 the small one sit down with your chair please put your chair down so you don t fall
not including the freezer put your chair down are you erasing the table talk and then my arm no honey look
0 it s all this space that is not the strong leg your leg would be a better option me that s 1st grade stuff well then pay attention like 4th graders and i won t have to do it
d we used to do that in 3rd grade sit down please stop standing up chair all right focus back with me because after this we re about to talk about something and i need your full attention so raise your hand if you have something that you guys come up with that more than one of you at your table had that you would like to share
d okay nobody has what i do s the table leg of table 5 okay the side of the table the short side of the table leg nuh it can t be that because it s not finished growing yeah see i told you what do you have
home yeah yeah but is your tv as long as the string tv white board i ve got a video the white shh stop shouting out about your tv was saying the white board screen might be as long as his string yeah what i saw the world s biggest gummy worm the world s biggest gummy worm
j a poster board a poster board that would be probably really close across the middle of the table guys you re having your own conversations we should be listening because you might get ideas from other people t the bookshelf maybe the bookshelf okay i mean i think the bookshelf s a little bigger than your string
a snake a snake could be that size a a pregnant lady s belly a pregnant lady s belly okay now i want to flip back to the very 1st page with did with the unit piece
square it should be on the back of what you just did okay hands down are you listening i m going to tell you something that you need to write at the bottom of your paper neatly so and if you don t have any room at the bottom write it down the side or something okay what we just did was we measured things with non standard units
we estimated how much we thing something would be about this size right and i call them non standard because did we use a ruler no we used other things to say 0 i think it s about the size of my string remember that i said your pinky nail is about the size of the unit
you could measure across something and measure your pinkies down and say this is about 5 pinkies long or 10 pinkies long okay non standard well it just so happens that your non standard pieces actually are a certain length that we want to talk about today so we re going to write with that like this
so at the bottom of this page you re going to write and this is for this piece you don t have to draw it because it s already drawn on there for you
right i told you not to draw it you i m drawing it up here so you can see which one it matches with okay your next one turn to the 2nd one we did not the string but the one with the rod okay
if this one centimeter one square is one centimeter how many squares are in this rod be 10 centimeters 10 centimeters does anybody know or heard the name of what we call 10 centimeters besides calling it 10 centimeters it has its own name
or we would call one decimeter a decimeter is what you call 10 centimeters do you want us to write that yeah and i want you to make sure you have this parenthesis part 10 cm means the same thing as one dm
dm can i just write down you can write down what i have up here 10 cm equals one dm
string we measured this 10 times we measured that 10 times is if one of these is called one decimeter and we used that 10 times to measure our string our string is . all right let s back up
our string is 10 decimeters and i ll just abbreviate this one because we know what decimeters is now and said 100 centimeters how does he know that 100 centimeters is what this is
because you count to 1010 times equals a 100 because 10 centimeters in each decimeter so 1010 different times also equals a 100 centimeters but these 2 things equal one more thing
be one meter one meter good and one m stands for meters so we ll put that 0 okay the one we wrote all our stuff about the string on
10 decimeters equals a 100 centimeters that equals one meter so your string is about one meter long do you remember yesterday when we started talking about length and i said a meter a meter is kind of like the size of a baseball bat almost maybe not baseball bats that kids use but if we were like major leaguers
it s kind of hard to see because the string is it won t stick out straight do you have that written down
yes now how could you use all 3 of these things to measure some parts on your body yeah but how would you do it
i want to use what was just doing it do what you just did with your arm and your string with your arm and your string
half watch what did he folded his string in half and stand more this way so if i were to hold this at the very tip for this goes from about the tip of his finger to his ..
right yeah so this whole string is is the whole string the length of his arm it folded it in half but are we would that be a good measurement if i said if we were going to get a shirt made could he go say okay so half a string is the length of my arm could he figure out what half the string is now that we know what each of these means
yes so how could we figure out what s half a string string 101 meter a 100 centimeters or one meter or 10 so could we break any of these in half what decimeters so s arm could be 5 decimeters
be . 50 centimeters 50 centimeters or a whole meter we could say is . right so if you turn the page from where you re on just have a seat unpack have a seat there are different parts of your body the one on the bottom is the one just did drawings you did that yes
so now what you can t see because i stapled it at the top the 1st column says estimate the 2nd column says measurement and the last column says how much off so you re going to figure the difference between your estimate and your measurement
is yeah so we re only going to do one today but i want you to pick one on there 1st estimate don t measure it yet down 1st estimate which one pick which one you want to do and estimate it
string if it s a smaller part of the body like your hands and you want to use your rod or a finger or something and you want to use your cube that s fine estimate then use what you re using either string rod or unit and measure that actual part
have those both those numbers and then what are you going to do to find the difference between the 2
okay so what you need to do is if you re using this are we going to say i think the length of my hand is about one.5 rods no . one decimeter one decimeter so we pick which one we want to use we can say i think the length of my hand is about not 10 centimeters maybe 15 okay
so i would estimate that then i actually measure it and see how far off i am those go ahead so write it as your estimate and then measure it you never did staple mine okay well just work on it and i ll staple it afterwards
estimate do i different one since we already know what your answer is wait wait wait take it off you have to estimate 1st 0 i don t know what to estimate well that whole hold the whole string out and look at the whole string it s not that s a whole meter so how much of it do you think would fit would just be your head do you think like half of it or 3 quarters of it
think half okay so how much what could you call half of your string we just talked about what do you want to say decimeters centimeters or . do you want to use centimeters yeah or decimeters centimeters so what s half if the whole thing is a 100 centimeters what would be half 50 so you can estimate that the around your head would be 50 centimeters
you so just work with and help do what he s doing and then we ll catch up later
0 measuring yes okay now if you get if you re using your string if you re using your string are you listening yes if you re using your string and let s say you measure something and you only come up with and you only use this much of your string
no could we lay it next to the rod or next to the units and try to measure out how much that is that if you re not using all of your string we re not using rulers either we re using our pieces and you can use that
this is right i think okay but open open that up and that is half of your string estimated and it was true so what is your difference going to be if you have the same amount
5 decimeters -5 decimeters should i put that right here yes and what is 5 -50 so if you have the same your difference is 0 up we could be done they re just finishing up their thing it s a half okay just give me a 2nd sit down i mean i thought you measured your foot
749 all right boys and girls i want you to have your homework out so we can check that it thank you
we did pw 80 yesterday i know some of you we did not finish one of my groups didn t finish yesterday and i told you that group to try the homework and so if we get an answer and you are confused i ll clear it up today when we get to group okay and you can come with that same last group make sure you understand what s going on
right maybe at the reducing fraction part there s a reducing fraction part well you had to from your answers group i m going to quick tell you the answers take your papers please number one when you add it equals 4 6 ths and you are able to reduce it to 4 3 rds 0 we were supposed to reduce it
number 2 7 8 ths number 3 gave you an answer of 7 5 ths which is an improper fraction and you needed to turn it into a mixed number which would be one and 2 5 ths 9 5 ths let me finish and i ll did you put one and 2 5 ths
7 i thought it was 2 +4 i mean i did 4 +5 d sorry like can you just put the whole number 1st do you have to write the improper fraction i would rather you write the improper fraction and then make it to the mixed number
now were you trying to explain to what he did wrong okay you added the denominator instead of the 2 numerators okay well we ll look at it when you come to my group number 4 is 7 12 ths number 5 is 13 10 ths which is improper and so you need to make it mixed one and 3 10 ths
number 6 is 5 4 ths which is one and one 4th it s an improper fraction and so you make it to a mixed number number 7 is 3 5 ths number 8 was 9 9 ths and you should have put equals one whole number 9 is 6 11 ths number 10 is 5 9 ths
one 2 number 12 is 13 9 ths which is a mixed improper fraction and you turned it into a one and 4 9 ths and what s that called one and 4 9 ths improper fraction well 13 9 ths is improper number it has a whole number and a fraction right number 13 you had to find the value of the square which was 7
6 number 15 was 9 addition did anybody do a multiplication problem for number 17 even though it was addition good anybody do a multiplication problem and rally for 18
50 21 was 27 those 24 is 2 one 6th
2 3 rds 28 is 3 and 7 8 ths one 5th and 11
2 3 rds if you have any questions about your homework i want you to bring it back to the group when we come today and we ll go over any questions that you may have had now i showed you yesterday actually yeah we ll stay there
yesterday i showed you how to add a fraction just like denominators and showed you when i was a little girl the problem that i had so i said that would be 2 3 rds if i had this problem 2 3 rds +one 3rd no that s not thirds
2 4 ths i ll put on there 2 4 ths +one 4th do you remember the mistake that i used to make was you said the answer was 3 8 ths i said that my answer would have been 3 8 ths
j you have stay the numerator the same the denominator good the denominator stays the same you don t add the denominator you add just the numerator and we modeled it we showed the 2 3 rds the 2 4 ths here and the one 4th here and we add them together and we end up with 3 4 ths do you think the same thing is going to be true when we do subtraction
no say that i have 2 fourths and i am going to take away one 4th look here is 2 4 ths right here
away so am i left with something over there one over there negative no because there is still a piece so my denominator doesn t change when i subtract either words do you remember what they were no i mean no
what were some big words that we talked about yesterday well one that started with an s but i don t remember what j reduce and another one that we talked about
lowest teacher seems like there was one more simplest form simplest form what does that mean
c it s got to be reduced and more well i mean it can t be reduced if it you know okay let me give you an example here is 2 4 ths it can t be reduced unless you reduce it and it has a remainder you can t reduce it without the remainder right right exactly
i know what you are saying 2 4 ths is that in simplest form do reduce makes it smaller so we were going to make it smaller
2 and remember i m a so i like to write it where i can see it 2 and so what are these 2 fractions equivalent and so is 2 4 ths really the same as one 2
is it s the same amount of space and i don t have my one 2 piece up here but you can see here is 2 4 ths and if we line it up it is the same thing as one half you are finding an equivalent fraction that can t be divided any more tips so let s go ahead and get ready for our centers
yes it s called like 3 is a what s it called prime number yeah prime numbers you can t do it unless it can be divided by yes and we ll talk about that in group you are exactly right
today you guys are going to go to problem solving so why don t you come get problem solving and why don t you go ahead to your area go ahead to your money center and i think you might be closest so come get your bucket
bucket tomorrow 0 them 0 okay and come you all go into mimeo game board game computer and i ll get the mimo up in just a minute you guys mac activity
closest in that group yes and my last group get journal for your group please
ms v in the group we finished the one sheet that is in there that orange sheet there should be another problem solving sheet in there there is the orange ones do we go in the folders and get one me yeah go ahead and erase it and i ll get the mimo turned on for you
plan yeah okay and you are going to come back 1st though with my 1st group so make sure you understand what you did yesterday you bumped the camera okay be careful what center are you
okay do you know what you just did to that yes because there are some things that are a little different it yes mall did you say you are going to the mall
today okay i think i know i showed j this yesterday girls i don t know that if you knew this i am going to just let you pick which fraction game you want to play off this website that i think there is 40 something different ones you may have heard this whole thing so make good choices and pick wait on the computer yeah you ll do it through the mimo but there is 40 different games about fractions and so you get to pick so you need to calibrate it real fast
okay your birthday is in january are you all doing mimo 1st
they also got improper fractions that they had to turn into mixed numbers
today thank you
okay yesterday we got the adding fractions part so write this down and mark the so the camera can see they are having a nice view of your cute hair do down write one 6th +4 6th
i m going to start with that one babe one 6th +4 6 ths
that we are not adding fractions we just heard that yesterday get very good everybody got 5 12 ths that was i added the denominator it will be those little the 12 pieces and that would not be i showed you yesterday that would not be the same amount of space
okay 5 6 ths is there anything that goes into 5 and 6 the same number 2 goes into 5 evenly okay let s do this one
let s do 5 6 ths with one 6th 0 just draw a line through it
down i want to see are you all doing what you should be doing wait what is it 5 6th +one 6th and i should see very nice
good very good i shouldn t see it yet good you all remember that it equals one whole so you need to make sure it equals one whole so i have a question for you is 5 6 ths less than one
no yes yes i m trying to see it is less than a whole because here is the number one here is one 6th 2 6th can you all see
colds i think we are doing better now we can move the kleenex it is it s one 6th less than a whole but it seems like it will be bigger than a whole almost because it has more numbers yeah but it is still you can look at it and see that 5 6 ths is less than one whole so how would you write that with a greater than less than sign
5 6 ths put one and then put 5 6 ths and what would you put with a greater than and less than sign the alligator mouth to the one yes let me see it write it on your paper 5 6 ths and the whole number one
sit up here so i can see what you are doing okay actually you did it backwards it s okay i get confused on those too one did you get greater than or less than 5 6 ths and one whole those numbers
ms v can i get an eraser you know where they are on my desk what you did is correct because one is bigger than 5 6 ths is greater than right good okay let s do this problem let s do 2 6 ths +2 6 ths
over you tell me can you simplify it 2 both those numbers are even so you are going to use start with 2
division i put divided 2 by the 4 6 so when you find equivalent fractions you do it to the top and the bottom and so you are going to divide the top and the bottom by the so 2 let s see what you ve got good what s this did you simplify 2 6 ths +2 6 ths
what does simplify mean what you find the equivalent fraction very good how did you do that with your how did you get that
okay thank you 2 3 rds because i didn t look at i know you didn t i m just teasing because 3 2 times equals 6 2 because 2 can get up to 6 and 4
no okay let s do another one let s do one 6th +2 6th one 6th +2 6th ah there you go nice job
simplify i see your little brain starting very nice brain it don t bother me nice job can it be an improper fraction no
3 how did you do okay is that simplest form or can it reduce again okay what number can go into 3 and into 6 2 2 times what is 3
2 times what is 3 6 yeah okay so divide by 3 good so what are you going to divide by 3 okay so write it down put divide by 3 on both numbers a 3 and a 6
you have it right here i know is this the answer yes how did you get that okay how did you get that answer what did you do
i added that so i got 3 6 ths so then i did divided it by 3 so it was a one and then 2 because that goes into a lot of times you can divide the numerator into the denominator that s a good place to start seeing if those 2 if the numerator will divide into the denominator let s make a list of all the different ways that you can reduce so what s one trick to simplify what s one trick
the numerator can divide into the denominator okay so one of i m going to make a chart for us see if the numerator can divide into the denominator all right that s one trick
do what s another one we talked about today if you can find another number that both of it can go in like 2 even then you can use 2 okay but do they always have to be even to no but if you have like 2 4 yes
if those numbers are even use 2 what s another thing we could do j both numbers are lower you can use 11 is the simplest form so it would be the same number
one i can t remember what you said did you say if those numbers are divisible by 3 yeah what did you say 0 that s right you said 2 if those numbers are divisible by 3 that means divided by
then i ll give you your pencil and let s see if we use one of these rules 2 25 ths +3 25 ths okay add it and see if you can simplify it
hey what 2 25 ths +3 25 ths 0 nice job tricks i am going to tell you it will be one of these good you see what we did yesterday
i got it when you drew it on the board you are going to use one of these strategies so see if the numerator can divide into the denominator are you finished no see no let him think for a 2nd try it
times okay write that down can 5 go into 25 5 5 times and then you circle it
tomorrow okay let s do one more and then i m going to switch it up on you a little bit hard one 10th do you need a chair 4 10 ths one 10th +4 10 ths
hurt one 10th +4 10 ths sure that s your job yeah that s right you will simplify once you get the answer very nice do you understand okay one 10th +4 10 ths it s 5 10 ths right so how many times will 5 go into 10
2 times you are good in math think about it use one of these strategies okay write it down nice job what did you divide by see 0 you have to replace i want to see you are thinking what was it you divided by
for the 1st few times i want to see what you are thinking what number are you dividing by write it down write down the number you are dividing by you are dividing by 2
by divided 2 times what is 5 2 okay okay write it down where did you put very nice okay now what s 5 divided by 5
remember yesterday when we did it right there you have 10 divided by 5 equals what 10 divided by 5 equals write it down this way that way you can see it understand okay i will help you right here and if you still don t know i want to do a little bit different one now
let s make your brains explode we ll see whose does it 1st try this one 7 10 ths plus no 5 10 ths that s easy
that s 7 not a one 12 10 ths that s that called
number write it a little bit larger it when you 1st add it you get 12 10 ths right here like this
now make that into a mixed number do your 12 10 ths you are fine
no where is your mixed number 0 very nice you did this on the test last week you made it into a mixed number it what was the strategy that you used to make it an improper fraction into a mixed number
pictures okay it will simplify it will number did you do a division problem or did you draw a picture
then show me the division problem how did we simplify so what are you going to use even okay use it
2 no did you do it like that or did you draw 12 lines so 10 and you had this so what is the whole number one
one and you were right 2 10 ths now that will simplify one and 2 10 ths yes ma am you remember this from last week how did you do baby
you feeling okay today very nice i want you to just go ahead and put right there also one that was a did you reduce that one tell your mom we did a lot of math
if those numbers are even what are you going to try to divide by
did you find it thank you it make it into a mixed number 0 mixed number nice
i m not done can it reduce yes reduce to what what are you going to divide by no can the both be divided by are they both even 3 it s in simplest form
you may go back to your center how you doin i know when you finish this one simplify even can you divide the numerator into the denominator are both numbers is 5 divisible by 3
3 times what is 5 then you are at simplest form then you are done okay what are you working on one if those numbers are even divide by 2
2 you are going to have to put your strategy because you are forgetting them mentally yeah i mean i can do them mentally but i just forgot how to do the mixed number okay do you want me to show you with pictures or do you want me to show you with division division okay the division is very easy
you are going to divide by i remember how to do the division but i liked mentally better okay but you need something that you can do to remind yourself how to do it mentally you know what i mean 4 okay so with these 2 numbers what does that tell you one okay which one is the numerator 3
0 i get it i remember how i did it now let s do one more yes i want you to write it down where you can see and i can see divided by 2 and you are right but it s not just one 5th
also one and one 5th more what okay try that one yes this way easier for you now
so if you can do this it can remind you the answer and then you can probably figure out mentally from there but i want you to have a backup plan in case you don t remember how you doing let me see actually i want to see group you all come back with journal and pencil
let me see yes i want you to draw a picture and tell me if that is correct are you using a picture or division group should be here in 5 4 3 come on some on
pencil thank you for being quick 2 so what is it part yes
write down 2 6 ths and tell me how would you know that that fraction needs to be reduced or simplified they are both the same what do you mean they are not both the same they are both even so simplify and reduce are synonyms you are right i thought you meant they are the same number
even so if they are both even then that is one of the strategies that my other group came up with and i m not going to show you the other i want you to figure them out yourself but if those numbers are even then you can divide by 2 then go ahead and simplify that fraction 2 6th and tell me what it reduces too or simplifies too i mean it s the same thing write it in simplest form
i like how you wrote everything down so i can see exactly what you are thinking okay what if you had this what if you had 5 25 ths
5 25 ths and 0 you need to get working at your center please now either mimo or board game all right simplify 01st of all we ll just reduce what are you going to simplify with
51 of my strategies the other group came up with was see if the numerator will divide into the denominator what that means is can 5 go into 25 a lot of times you ll be able to use that strategy and that s what you did for this one too one 5th okay and there is one more let s see if you have it
you talked about prime numbers today what did you mean by prime number if there is a prime number you can only what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by itself or by one
a prime number is a number that you can only multiply one and itself like one times 3 number the only way to multiply and get 3 is to multiply one by 35 is a prime number the only way to get 5 is to multiply one by 5
is 6 a prime number no yes what times what is 7 that s not a one or 70 7 is a prime number 9 is a prime number no not 9 is 8 a prime number no
no there is one one but no other even number is prime is 9 prime number 2 is too low low huh no 9 is not because you can divide it by 3 number yeah no it s even it s too low
11 yeah yeah 11 is prime 11 is a prime number okay if you have 2 prime numbers it won t reduce either it won t reduce if you have 2 prime numbers it won t reduce right because 5 is prime 6 is not prime but there is nothing that goes into 5 and 6 that s the same the denominator can be divided by prime numbers are you with me
right 5 25 ths okay and then my group said we can see if those numbers were divisible by 3 we could also see if they are both divisible by 4 so that means will they both divided by
0 there is 2 different ways you can do this 12 different ways good you got the right answer no because 3 divided by 4 isn t one
again okay look at what you did okay i think there is 2 ways you can get the answer you can do it twice like divide it by 2 or divide it by 4
shhh sorry you are thinking your brain is working a little backwards let me show you what you did wrong because you divided it by 3 but what you cause you know that 3 times 4 is 12 right and so but you need to divide it by 4 instead of 3
did you just did it backwards okay i m very proud
3 okay i want you to do this problem 4 10 ths make sure you you don t have to redo it now
look at your answer see if it will simplify
see if your answer will simplify of course we have to do more problems of course give me a break well give us a break dude we get it every saturday and sunday there you go
one 6th i will check if everyone got the right answer of one 5th you went ahead and reduced it 4 6th -one 6th
took your answer it maybe simplified it maybe simplified it may be in simplest form yeah i said that incorrectly are you all finished or what then you all can do something else
use one of these 3 strategies we are going to use one of those 3 good where is yours what strategy did you use see if the numerator can divide into the denominator
0 okay 4 good all right one more last one and then you are going to leave me for a while yeah yeah you are leaving me
you 5 8 ths -2 8 ths am going to email your mom and tell her that
not yeah you were the 1st back here 5 8 ths -2 8 ths will it reduce try your strategies see if can the numerator divide into the denominator you can divide by whatever number you want yeah are they both even 4 is it in simplest form
yes maybe yes it is in simplest form questions i know we need a little bit more practice with reducing just one more yes you can have one more if you want to have one more you can stay if you don t you can head back to your group but i will actually give you one more
9 9 ths -one 9th it is what strategies did you use i can kind of hear you thinking through it
i m thinking you could do 8 so you were seeing if 8 went into 9 and it can t right and then i they are both not even the numerator and denominator are both not even see if both are and they are not and they are not divisible by 4
okay nice job you understand it a little bit better now
yeah okay group come back with journal and pencil journal and pencil they are not even doing their center they are making origami figures okay they are like working on origami doing nothing thank you are you all working on your center what center are you all on
it kind of looks like you all maybe are talking a little bit and that s not part of your journal center go now my other groups came up with some strategies no peeking missy c sick i was going to say you are the only girl over there today
j okay my other group came up with some strategies and i want to see if you can figure out this strategy and these were to help you know when you need to simplify or to reduce so let s 1st do one little practice round before we go let s do one 6th +one 6th find the answer
that is it in simplest form too 0 i love how you wrote everything out for me to see it
and i want you to write division right here so i can see what you are dividing by write the division so i can see what you divided by yes just like that just at the beginning i want to see the division okay what strategy did you use here simplify i know but how did you know what to divide by
2 right i am going to tell you the strategy and you re going to say yeah that s what we did
if both numbers are even both the numerator and the denominator are even you can divide by 2 and that s what you did thing so if you have like 8 10 ths are 8 and 10 both even are 8 and 10 both even numbers yes are 8 and 10 both even numbers
2 okay so are 10 16 ths both even numbers yes divide by 2
more let s try 2 10 ths +2 10 ths
job good good good i can t simplify you are right you are doing it right i m still teaching yes good everybody got it
use now i m going to tell you another strategy that we came up with and that is to see if the numerator can divide into the denominator i m going to give you a problem where you have to do this i don t like that strategy i do try this one
3 25 ths and use the strategy will the numerator go into the denominator
25 okay then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 see better 5 divided by 50 i thought it was 5 divided by 25
no divide them both by 5 it just like you did right there i mean you don t have to write this forever just in the beginning okay
let s do one 9th +2 9 ths
try the strategy of dividing the numerator into the denominator good nice i like how you wrote it try to divide the numerator into the denominator you are doing it right
when we do it do we divide that by that you divide 3 into 3 and 3 into 9 yes okay you are going to divide the numerator and the denominator by the numerator 3 that was my fault
you there you go tomorrow i am going to give you all some homework on the subtracting
us no no no the whole class if you are confused about how to simplify then when we come to group tomorrow did you have any questions about your homework last night no so if you have questions tomorrow i totally understand and i ll help you with those tomorrow and i m going to call you all 1st tomorrow you can go all right you need to tidy up your centers put everything away
seats all my centers need to be back in their spots in 10 back in your spot in 9
8 will you turn the screen off computer back in your spot by 7 what honey you didn t play the computer yesterday okay i ll talk to your group about that back to your spots in 7 whoever had chess and mancala needs to fix that whatever group that was over here in games
one tomorrow i m going to meet 1st with group and 2nd with a group because i didn t meet with you all at all today so i will get with you all tomorrow i am going to put the chart some of my groups come up with a chart on how to simplify my computer it talking hold on
off there we go okay i am going to make a chart tomorrow to give you some clues to know how to know when to simplify but you do have some homework tonight man the next page turn there very good
pw 81 look there at your homework so you know what we are going to do do we have to simplify all right on this page it s just like what we did last night only it s subtraction simplifying if you came to my group today and we talked about 3 or 4 different strategies about how to simplify i want you to try those strategies if those work
10 11 12 and 13 are pictures where you have to write a subtraction problem together what subtraction problem do you think that picture represents 10 wait 0 3 -one 2 2 i said 3 -2
no because these are fractions so i am thinking there is probably going to be a fraction in there somewhere 3 5 ths -2 5 ths so i would agree what you d 3 5 ths because there is 3 5 ths drawn there and then they circled 2 and 3 5 ths so i would agree with you that it was 3 5 ths -2 5 ths equals one 5th
one 5th where is that let s look at number 12 what would that represent it s not one whole i ll give you that clue what do you think it is one i mean yes 3 4 ths well this whole page is subtraction so
3 4 ths -one 4th and then a little arrow like what is left the arrow there page there is some 2 digit by 2 digit 2 digit by 3 digit multiplication on there and then some simple division which you need to keep those skills fresh in your mind okay questions i don t get number 12
loud i know but i still don t okay then i will help you in just a minute okay you i don t but i think it confuses me like yeah 0 it s 3 like taking like 2 5 ths 0
now it s kind of like an optical illusion okay i will see you tomorrow in the back of this class you can line up yes say it again okay tomorrow before my 1st group i will pull you and show you go i think i kind of do
let me see yes because you look in the top that would be your whole and that s probably what you are subtracting out this would be your whole and that s what you are subtracting out you are welcome did i do that right because i kinda don t yes him what did i do those 2 right yes that would be your whole that would be what you are subtracting out
well not you re whole but this would be the whole fraction that you are using and then this would be what you subtract out out yeah 0 that is your spelling list for the entire quarter what s a quarter 9 weeks is it still recording it is
i have to let it record for a little bit longer open the door quietly and see if she s ready for you okay let s real fast that so 3 4 ths and that s what you are subtracting out yes that would be your whole what is that not your whole but 2 4 ths and that s what are you are subtracting out
yeah 4 5 ths -one good good good do you see now baby okay i have a minute i can show you if you want me too no they asked me to let it run a little bit longer my class we are getting ready for read aloud
fast okay babe read aloud
okay this would be what you are subtracting so it would be one 2 3 so i get this 3 5 ths this is what you are subtracting out so what are you subtracting out good so that s your problem 0 okay this one is different
3 4 ths that s what you are subtracting out and then you have the actual answer though got it
go grab a paper towel
now you have 9 minutes left to complete your do now 1st problem says 2 thirds +2 fourths equals what number 25 sixths -13rd equals 3 how do you multiply fractions describe what you think are the steps and 42 thirds times 2 fourths so you are going to ahead and you are answering those problems
great job table 2
excellent table 4 so number 2 is just like number one except what are you doing on number 2 subtract all right while you guys are steadily working can someone tell me it says 2 thirds +2 fourths can i go ahead and add these no
not the denominators are not the same multiple what is my least common multiple of 3 and 4
what is my next step divide divide 12 divided by 3 is
88 same step again 12 divided by 4 is 333 times 2 is
66
14 twelfths 14 twelfths are we in agreement
this improper improper fraction that means my numerator is bigger than my denominator excellent job find the denominator the denominator what is my lcm of 6 and 3 same i have 5 sixths -6 but there is something i got to figure out what that numerator is
so how do i figure out my numerator divide dividing 6 divided by 3 is 225 sixths -2 sixths equals what 3 sixths 3 sixths do i notice anything about 3 sixths
it can be reduced it can be reduced what number goes into both 3 and 662333 okay it has to be even it has to go into the number evenly you can not have anything leftover or need anything so 3 divided by 3 is
is one half one half good job all right number 3 this one is a little bit tricky because if we don t know how to multiply fractions just yet we might not be able to answer that question but i wanted you guys to think about what you might do to multiply fractions so do i have anybody that would like to give it a shot
r i think that you find the lcm and then you get 12 and then you multiply 12 which is 144 and then you find the numerator and then you multiply the numerator good job
okay do you have something you think no i do not i know okay how do you think you find multiply fractions i know across multiply straight across does anyone else want to give it a shot d multiply straight and then you divide by 2
ideas so the correct answer is you are going to multiply straight across you multiply the numerator by the numerator the denominator by the denominator so by the end of today is lesson we are going to know how to multiply fractions so to multiply fractions we know that i am going to end up multiplying my numerators and my denominators
right they do not have to be the same
so when you multiply they do not have to be the same so am i looking this problem right here i know that if i am multiplying straight across i have 2 times 2 over 3 times 4 what is 2 times 244 what is 3 times 412124 twelfths can this be reduced yes yes
1244 so i am dividing by 44 what i do on top i have to do where to the bottome to the bottom 4 divided by 4 is is 3 my final answer is 13rd
you are getting a math textbook for everybody at your table 0 v and e
76 all right we are paying attention because we are reading you don t want to lose any leads for your class all right fractions are rational numbers multiplying fractions when you multiply 2 fractions thinking about area can help example what is 3 fourths of 2 thirds step one think how much is 3 fourths of 2 thirds of this rectangular region
step 2 shade 2 thirds of the region this way step 3 shade 3 fourths of the region this way now 3 fourths of 2 thirds of the region is shaded both ways that is 6 twelfths or one half of the whole region 3 fourths of 2 thirds equals 6 twelfths which then is reduced to one half
when you find a fraction of a number you can use a multiplication symbol for the word of so 3 of 43 fourths of 2 thirds equals 3 fourths times 2 thirds which equals 6 twelfths which equals one half m multiplication of fractions problem the problem above is the example of the problem
to multiply fractions simply simply simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators this pattern is the
cd so equals a times c over b times d all right example 3 fourths times 2 thirds equals 3 times 2 over 4 times 3 which equals 6 twelfths all right so in your math journals we are working out the problem together
13rd times one half so through our reading i know that when i am multiplying fractions i am multiplying straight across so i have one times one over 3 times 2
answer in your math journals go ahead and work out the next 2 problems as well
all right let us take a look at the 2nd one b
so i know again when i am finding how to multiply a fraction i know that i 1st multiply my numerator straight across is 313 times one is what 35 times 4 is
20 my final answer is 3 twentieths the next problem i have 5 sixths times 3 tenths i can multiply straight across as well however trick that we are going to learn once we get to do our promethean board activity our flipchart we are going to learn how we can cross reduce
so when we cross reduce we make our numbers smaller so that that way when we go to multiply straight across we are not getting really big numbers that we then have to go ahead and try to reduce so if i cross reduce i am looking at 5 and 10 and 6 and 3 all right and i am looking to see what is the gcf so think about the gcf
number so what are my factors 1st of 51 that prime prime then if i look at 10 what are my factors of 1010 what is the biggest number they have in common 55 so what i am going to do with this 5 now is divide it by these 2 numbers
so 5 divided by 5 equals one this 5 becomes one these i can look to see if they have factors if i look what is the factor of 3 and 631233 so 3 divided but 3 is is 2 so now i have one times one equals 11
2 times 2 equals 44 yes how can 0 never mind you can still do it the other way you sometimes though when you start to use bigger numbers it gets a little bit confusing but we are going to learn how to do that in our flipchart all right continue on page 77
r can i use the bathroom you may d multiplying fractions whole numbers and mixed numbers multiplying whole numbers the multiplication problem can be used to multiply the whole number and a fraction
24 divided by 143 equals what equal 5 what 5 and 2320 fourths all right so we are going to stop right there go ahead and close your books put your book to the corner of your desk
i need one volunteer from each table to get enough whiteboards for everyone at your table so c r d m careful we are careful is coming around with the markers do not open your marker or write on your whiteboard until you have been instructed to do so
if for any reason you are writing on it prior you are not going to be able to use the whiteboards and the markers
you are going to lose that privilege and you will use a sheet of paper and a pencil do you have a question they should all work
they are all writable markers all right everybody is silent in 54321 and 0 open in your math journal you are writing the title 5th grade multiplying and dividing fractions we are going to take a couple of notes
if you had it open it was only to check to make sure they worked if you had one of the small skinny black ones those are all brand new so they all work right now everybody should have our title we are on to the next page rewrite it
steps step one multiply numerators step 2 multiply denominators
it we are getting ready to solve it together so if i look at this problem i have 4 fifths times 16th i know that the 1st step is to what multiply multiply my numerators so i have 4 times one over 5 times 6 what 445 times 6
3030 if i look at this fraction i know it can be reduced because both of these are even i know all even numbers are divisible by 2 all right so i know that this can be eventually be reduced all right we are not going to reduce it on this slide because i am going to continue to show you how to reduce it on the next slide
once again we are practicing cross reducing so even easier steps down 1st one you want to think does the numerator and denominator share factors
if they do then you are going to cross reduce that is what we are doing over here on the board up here then number 3 multiply numerator and denominator we are writing that
reduce so i look does the numerator and denominator share factors remember when you are cross reducing you are going to the sides so i if look at one and 5 i know that is not going to work so i go ahead and check 4 and 64124124 what are my factors of 6
12361236 what number do they have in common 22 they have 2 in common so now i am going to use 2 to divide is 33 so that is my new number
is 22 that is my new number so now i am multiplying 2 times one over 5 times 32 times one is what 225 times 3 is what 15 that is how i get the answer when i am cross multiplying all right
so okay multiplying fractions on your whiteboard we are working this problem out
i have 2 thirds times 14th 2 thirds times 14th what do you know about this fraction can you make it smaller then you got to reduce it
it all right we are working on this problem right here
job the correct answer is 110th when you reduce it let us check to make sure we have it correct 110th excellent how would you do that
all right we are not on that one right now so we are doing it now
now i have 4 ninths times 12 sixteenths this problem if you look you start to have bigger numbers this would be a good problem to try to cross reduce can you cross reduce yes 4 and 16 yes can you cross reduce 9 and 12 so if i am looking at that i know that i need to list my factors of 4 and 16
4 if i list my factors of 4 what are my factors of 412412 and 4 then if i list my factors of 16 what are my factors of 161122446
it is it 6 or 886 times what is going to give me 16 anything no 164 times 4 is 16 so what is going here
and 1216 what is the biggest number they have in common 34 we don t have 3 up here 4 so 4 divided by 4 is one all right 16 divided by 4 is
4 now let us look at 9 and 12 what numbers does 9 and 12 have in common what factors 339 divided by 3 is what 33 is 443 times 4 is
12 can this be reduced yes what number goes into both 4 and 1242
112 divided by 4 is what
33 so 3 divided by 3 i mean yeah 3 divided by 3 is 115 divided by 3 is what 3515 divided by 3 is 5 so that becomes a 5 those are the 2 new numbers that i am working with now i am checking to see if i can cross reduce these 2 numbers what number goes into both 10 and 8
228 divided by 2 is 4 and 10 divided by 2 is 55 times one is 55 times 4 is
20 i have 5 twentieths can this be reduced yes yes what number goes into both 5 and 20
120 divided by 5 is 414th is your answer all right show it
if you ve not cleared your board show it
i didn t say show your board i cleared it i didn t say cleared it so you shouldn t have cleared it all right we are checking the next one
7 twentieths times 4 fourteenths not right now all right show it
we are listening to right now i got to multiply crossing 7 and 14 out because 2 times 7 is 14 so i had to cross 14 out and put 2 then i put one by the 7 that i crossed out
i multiplied those one times one and i got one and then i crossed out 20 and got 5 and then crossed out the 4 and got one
job go ahead and clear your boards right now we are getting ready to go to lunch so i need one person collecting all markers is responsible for making sure the lid is on every marker i would like quiet hands not screaming and yelling out
unless you are one of the helpers 432
0 you are not talking so quickly i need everybody looking up at the board on your homework we are going to do the 1st 2 we are going to do 2 problems together the 1st problem you should have the homework passed out already it doesn t take that long
multiply the numerator and then multiply the denominators so if i take a look at problem number one it says 15th times 2 thirds i know that to multiply that i just multiply numerator by the numerator denominator by the denominator one times 2 is is 152 fifteenths that is what you are doing for that part of your homework
back multiplying fractions sometimes you can use factoring when multiplying fraction and a whole number 1st make the whole number a fraction by using one as a denominator simplify by factoring and then multiply so i look at the 1st problem it is 14th times 8 how can i make this 8 a fraction
multiply divide not trying to divide anything right now one under the 8 under the 8 as my denominator all right then you go ahead and you multiply across or in this case i can go ahead and factor
i know that 4 can go into 4 and 84 goes into 4 how many times 14 goes into 8 how many times 222 times one is one so 2 over one equals 2 all right that is what you guys are doing for your homework
right now if you would like some actually for those of you that have to complete your homework from yesterday i am getting ready to give you copies of that for the rest of you if you would like to take your homework down for silent lunch you may do so all right so right now not right now
i will tell those students at recess that have to all right so for those of you that turned in your homework to me you are learning up t you owe me half all right so you are working on yours down there you owe me half as well
in line
is in line
am i missing anybody and j you are in line
girls good morning ms b who can raise their hand and actually let s talk about partners 1st
please turn and talk to your partner please join your group just for right now
you 30 more seconds math i hear some great conversations over here are we talking to partners about what we re doing in math
math i need you to focus please come on one 2 3 eyes on me one 2 eyes on you excellent who can raise their hand and tell me what you shared with your partner or what your partner shared with you
what have we been doing in math other measurements measurements absolutely in measurement what have we been talking about specifically in measurement a think about measurement what are we talking about angles table one put the pencils down
grade table 2 excellent think about measurement l inches units and yardsticks so we re talking about the units that we re measuring with
inches brought up that we re using yardsticks and what do yardsticks measure feet so if we were going to convert that into inches how many inches would that be
inches let me see who is sitting up and looking straight because remember what we talked about talked about what
listen i guess my question is why is 3 feet equal to 36 inches one foot equals 12 inches and 12 times 3 is 36 excellent can you repeat in your own words what just said and answering the question why is 3 feet equal to 36 inches 26 12 inches is one foot okay
person why is 3 feet equal to 36 inches because 12 inches equals one foot excellent so we really started talking about measurement
in addition to that this table i m going to have you move over there please okay
you you have a choice you can calm down now or you can calm down when i bring you to the office learning today we re going to continue talking about the next thing that we started which is polygons okay so i need everyone to put their attention up on the board
please i need us to see i fixed it
let s look at the 3 that are on the board right now and i will shut the shade okay what do we notice about those 3 shapes
partners okay
me one 2 eyes on you what do we notice about those shapes notice warning 2 what s warning 3 you go next door to mister that so let s not be so fresh
we re suggesting that these top shapes are polygons why are these polygons and these are not polygons line why are these 3 shapes up top polygons and these 5 shapes down here not polygons
minute once you have an answer put your thumb up once you have an answer on why the top are polygons and the bottoms are not polygons put your hands up please now why is the top polygons and the bottom now
next door please i couldn t hear door you re hurting everybody else s learning right now and i m very disappointed and very surprised
go go next door now 3 give me a last one let s go but i gave you warnings choice now this is the consequence
your action is that you were not listening and you were being disrespectful to your classmates go i m sorry boys and girls please why are the tops polygons and the bottoms are not
so you noticed that on the top the top shapes all those lines connect right and on the bottom we do have some connecting lines but we also have some that are not connected job is that an open shape or a closed shape
l the top shapes are polygons except for the one in the middle because it has a curve and it s not straight are you talking about these ones or these ones b so you re telling me the top ones are polygons yeah except for the one in the middle how many people agree with what is saying
how many people think these are polygons polygons honey right on the paper it says these are not polygons who can tell me why these are not polygons there why is that not a polygon
because all the lines are not connected so the lines are not connected mean one is connected but the rest flag good analogy it it looks like what a stick foot
does because it has this line going off the side that means it is not a closed angle figure this part right here is a closed figure but we re also not taking into consideration this 4 stop bouncing thank you all right
yes do you understand why this is not a polygon now polygon it s not a polygon because it is a closed shape but it does have an extra line good what about this shape no who can tell me why this is not a polygon
it doesn t have straight lines what else it does have a straight line so don t polygons have straight lines yes yes so why isn t this one a polygon it has a curve it has a curved line so you re noticing this line right here is curved but do polygons have curved lines have
lines do they have curved lines or straight lines so so far what have we learned about polygons figure closed so we learned it s a closed figure and we learned it has what kind of lines excellent i think we re coming up with a pretty good polygon definition
why why is this not a polygon because they re not connected what s not connected okay
connected who maybe can take s idea and put it in your own words g it s like 2 shapes on top of each other it s not one shape it s not one whole shape m it s not a closed shape no yes you think it s open here in the middle
yes so taking what you re saying and taking what is saying we know a polygon is what notice they cross right here right which i think was also trying to get at
sides so why isn t this a polygon what 2 shapes 2 shapes smashed together yes it s kind of like polygons have parallel lines do all polygons have parallel lines one a square a square has parallel lines
triangle a triangle is a polygon that does not have parallel sides 2 if we know a polygon not the best tracing is an open shape i m sorry a closed shape with many sides and this comes together is this open here
no this is closed so it is immediately eliminated as a polygon shapes i ll move up the transparency polygon i mean it has straight sides
n because it s not closed what do you mean it s not closed the sides are not connected connected right there 0 excellent job said yes excellent and this last one is this a polygon
no who can raise their hand and tell me what they observed hands it s not a polygon because there are 2 shapes on top of each other good
m it s just like the other ones 2 shapes smashed together so you made a connection to the shape up here connections excellent so i want us to direct our attention to our goals for today because we have actually already done one of them the 1st thing we re doing today is defining polygons as a closed figure with line segments as sides and vertices
words the 2nd thing we re going to be doing today is classifying polygons by attribute what s an attribute today what is an attribute
it s what is an attribute i want you to listen to someone else who has an answer and then put it in your own words because you re so good at summarizing m it s something about it right remember in reading this morning what word did we use to describe that
features we were looking at the features of non fiction texts characteristics we were looking at attributes attribute something that tells about you
also known as a summary or a maybe characteristic or detail okay vertex vertex again polygon polygon line segment line segment vertex vertex we already started defining our polygon so that s great
so the next thing we re going to do is now we re going to move onto classifying polygons i need to turn on the lights and can i have you open your math book to page 16 please 16 thank you
okay is everyone open to page 16 unit 4 yes instantly the 1st thing i noticed when i see this page is i just see shapes everywhere see polygons so you re already using these math words because what is a polygon
sides so when i said i see shapes you took it a step further job your job right now is to work with a partner and you ll have about 5 minutes to work with a partner and then we ll go over them to decide if the shape in front of you is a polygon or not a polygon if it is a polygon you are putting the letter p
if it is not a polygon you re putting np for not a polygon so hold on 12nd so one 2 3 eyes on me one 2 eyes on you i don t want you to just run through them and write p np
i want you to discuss why you have decided on p np because some of you might disagree with some of them think about what we said on the 1st items on the board sides was it the open figures the open shapes you can work with a table mate a partner or someone else at your table and you have about 5 minutes okay
you so let me see boys are you okay why don t we work with i m going to have work with you so we can discuss what s going on choice awesome job
all right what do you notice about this shape that it s a triangle we know what a triangle is excellent is it any curved sides
polygon good job take a seat and then you can take a seat
have 3 so when i speak to you the 3rd time you are not going to earn any stickers okay sticker so let s open up to page 16
i want you to we have different answers because you did this with let s see 12 i think no because who checked this me
me so for number 12 you re suggesting that it s not a polygon and you think it is a polygon is because it has connecting lines why do you think it is not a polygon
i think it s not a polygon because it has straight lines but it s like a it s not like the same size okay let s look at number 3 is that a polygon
polygon it s round is it round kind of on the top it s round does it have a curved one
no it s giving the illusion of a curve with many straight sides put together let me see a colored pencil so let s count the sides here 9 are those all straight sides
yeah so just because one side is longer than the other does that make a difference know i noticed you said it s not a polygon because all the sides aren t the same size 10 so we have 10 sides
figure yes at any point did we say anything about the length of the sides shape that it is yes why
because of the straight sides and job nice job
here good boys and girls about one more minute okay 12 what did we get for number 12 yeah it s a polygon p else it has lines that connect
good job and what else are any of those lines curved no they re straight and then my other question does it matter what length the lines are right it s whether it s open or not right job the big thing is curved lines and whether or not it s open
me one 2 eyes on you i must say i was very impressed with the conversations i heard table i got to a few of you and the conversations i heard were great let s just go through quickly and find out if our shapes are polygons or not polygons
okay shape number one was that a polygon job number 2 was that a p or an np why open who can raise their hand and tell me why
job i loved how put that in full sentences number 3 hold on 12nd i know we re going to show props
seat we don t need to take the long way around back we re showing props to the people who are speaking loud so it is a polygon because all the sides are straight and it is closed how many people put polygon for that one hands down
did anyone put not a polygon for number 3 great job guys i know at 1st some of the people i talked to it kind of gave the illusion that it was curved but if you really looked you discovered they were all straight sides p not a polygon
side number 5 number 5 is tricky because they re both put together so when they re both put together is it a polygon or not a polygon job the sides aren t connected excellent job
6 p on raise your hand for number 10 if you put p p pay attention to what i m saying listening skills
10 did you write p or np why because it s curved good 11
job so what i want us to do now i m looking to see who is sitting up straight looking great can we are going to work on can you get me a magnet please
here can you get me a magnet from that board we are going to look at polygons not polygons people thank you stuck we re going to look at polygons not polygons
n 0 my goodness thank you you are going to pick any shape from page 16 and draw it up here with a marker whoa you are a fantastic artist
great can you draw number one please polygon polygon good job shape excellent job
yes excellent number 2 come on up number 3 you re doing 2 do you need show her what number 2 looks like
who wants the challenge of number 3 go ahead you just go who would like the challenge of number 3
what s excellent job job
go sit down are you okay get up please get up with your feet please you okay chair you ve lost the one 2 3 eyes on me
one 2 eyes on you boys and girls we know what is appropriate behavior in this classroom and we know what is inappropriate behavior in this classroom so let s not support the inappropriate behavior that s okay number 4 i m looking to see who is sitting up straight looking great
l make it nice and big not huge number 5
okay that was great okay they can t see you poster all right one 2 3 eyes on me
one 2 eyes on you so once you guys are done sit down good job is a circle a polygon you tell me it s not why it s closed but excellent job
right now we ve done 5 of them and i want you to think about those different wiggle out your sillies for a 2nd wiggle them out out depress it down one 2 3 eyes on me one 2 eyes on you do it and sit down
so now we ve done a great job explaining what polygons have and what polygons don t have we ve done a great job explaining what is a polygon and what s not a polygon here you re going to tell me what a polygon must have and what a polygon cannot have
before your hands are up think about these for a 2nd before your hands are up time if i see another hand go up it s showing me that you re not listening and that you re not following directions so think about what a polygon must have and what a polygon cannot have
you ve earned a 2nd sticker keep up the good work i like the way that you re sitting there and eyes on me please
it can we do this again so i might earn more stuff absolutely okay i see your hand up and you are sitting being the best 4th grader you can be
star a polygon must have what lines that connect excellent a polygon must have lines that connect
else what does a polygon need to have t can i do a must not not yet must have it has it can t have a curve let s pick one connect so what else does it need
sides fantastic fact job what else must a polygon have
okay it s going to have angles and the angles are created because why curved if we have curved lines we re not going to have angles t it has to be closed
it has to be closed an ice cream cone has a pointy part but it s 3 d we ll talk about that later next week desperation what else must a polygon have
else a polygon must have this everyone showing props to
than more than one or 2 right good job
absolutely all right notes some of the vocabulary that we talked about we talked about polygons
segments a line segment is also the straight sides so i m going to make a note of that okay and vertices is where they connect okay the vertex all right
me one 2 eyes on you you guys are doing a good job this a polygon cannot have what l a polygon cannot have curved lines good no curved lines equal a polygon must have straight sides
sides so stick with your hand up distraction if a polygon has lines that connect a polygon would not have
shape there s a gap in them inside so a polygon cannot have a gap in the lines
this a polygon cannot have 2 shapes stacking up on each other
it cannot be round what else do we know about polygons they cannot have sides it can t be round
sides curved
other can i go to the bathroom go ahead so if a polygon must be closed it cannot be open it could not be open a polygon cannot have lines sticking out
good think of it this way this example right me one 2 eyes on you let s pay attention to
a polygon can t have 2 or less lines 2 or less lines sides angles job all right
me one 2 eyes on you today number one we defined polygons today right me i m going to pick 3 people and what s a polygon
connect what else and a polygon has many angles many angles many sides a a polygon has a closed shape a polygon is a closed shape
and lines that connect that do not have curves good what do we call those lines with straight sides
job what is a polygon a polygon is a shape that has and it is a closed shape
else one more person put it in your own words c no what is a polygon a polygon is everyone turn and talk to your partners
polygon what are you eating in a minute one 2 3 eyes on me
one 2 eyes on you who can raise their hand and tell me what they said or what their partner said g says excellent so many angles polygons we talked about their attributes their characteristics their numbers of sides lengths of sides sides of the angles
vocabulary polygon line segment end and vertex correct job this is the last activity you are opening up your math notebooks and putting a question on the board that is what did you learn about today in math
minutes don t say it
you ve got to write it
pencil i see some great thoughts and great ideas
sentence so when i read your answer i should know what the question is let s go
what s wrong my head hurts have you gone to the doctor yet about your headaches what s the prefix here
regular one more minute this let me see it okay next time we make sure we fill in all these empty spaces that are on these pages okay
started i want you to think of if you had a 4 by 6 rectangle let s just pretend that this is a 4 by 6 rectangle okay and you wanted to make a picture for a fraction 3 over 2 this numerator numerator and what is this
denominator how could you use this to represent 3 over 2 would you use one or would you use 2 cards 2 cards okay so could someone show me how they would represent 3 by 2 using a 4 by 6 rectangle
e we re going to pretend that this is a sandwich and we re making a sandwich 3 by 2 do so 1st you need one whole okay
so this is one whole and then you need a whole one . which is one half so label it label it please so . one whole and one half okay
so how can we write that as an equation equation anybody have any ideas
okay is there another way using that diagram that we can make an equation diagram is there another way
way is there another way
heads do you mean that i could not do could i do could i do that yes okay i could do that all right or i could have 34 by 6 rectangles and i could color one half one half one half okay
so today you have a list of fractions we saw that all those representations equaled 3 over 2 so today what you re going to do is you re going to be making fraction cards okay so you have a list of fractions in front of you
take out that list please you have this list in front of you list yes okay now each has 10 fractions that you re going to make using fraction cards and so that you re going to have a total of 10 fraction cards so for example this would be your fraction card
so the 1st fraction you re going to make is one and 3 fourths you only have a page that says wholes these squares equal a whole so one of these would equal one whole you have a i would like for you to look at me please
you have a paper that says fifths so this is divided into fifths one of these equals fifths and then you have one that s divided into thirds so you re going to have to do some figuring out how you re going to represent fractions so each card for example this is one of my fraction cards
card this big card is my card and suppose i want to make one and one half one and one half so i have one and it s colored in and i have one half that s my fraction card
it yes so you re going to have to be creative how you make your cards if you re working with fourths how are you going to do that do so how could i write this as an equation
t one +one half one +one half equals what one and one half one and one half yeah one and one half yes is there another way i can write that to equal one and one half
2 +one half 2 over 2 +one half equals equals one and one half is there another way i can do that
m one half +one half +one half one half +one half +one half equals one and equals 3 over 2 which equals one and one half okay that yes okay so go ahead get started
today we re going to be working on it for the next couple of days but we re going to start with a good attempt you re going to make sure that you make . the fraction cards 1st of all do you still have page 26 in your math papers
minute on page 26 it tells you how to make fraction cards while you re looking for it i m going to because i think that was one of the pages that we had in our packet that i told you to make sure you saved it s page unit 6 page 26
papers check to see if it s still in the book out hi you good how are you guys try to find it
26 unit 6 page 26 things unit 6 page 26
26 put your name on it when you have it 26 tear it out and put it in front of you unit 6 page 26
out unit 6 page 26 quickly look on with somebody who has it if you do not have it
unit 6 page 26 okay let s read what it says 10 pieces together 10 pieces of 8.5 by 11 inch of card
card some people have drawn papers where you cut it in fourths to make 40 cards that yes yes i am waiting for you time you re going to lose your recess time please book the book away
you i m sorry i was interrupted all right so you have page 26 which tells us how to make the fraction cards we have page 27 which lists the fractions okay you should have check to make sure you have these things
does everyone have the blank sheet that has the wholes the blank sheet that says wholes everybody has that yes it says m 16 do you have the blank sheet that says thirds it says m 17 on it yes do you have the blank sheet that says m 18
set it up for these takes time and you do have to work as team members read making the cards together 26 are we ready
shouting choose a fraction from the list of fractions for fraction cards list how about the list you re going to choose a fraction from down write your fraction on a blank fraction card hold up the blank fraction card whether it s paper or whether it s an index card
good use any of the blank blank wholes blank thirds or blank fifths to make a picture for this fraction no cut out and glue your picture onto your fraction card the name of the fraction when you have a finished card it will look something like this right here
and underneath it you re going to write an equation that is equal to the fraction card that you made that yes okay do it now please i would suggest that when you re making a fraction with this card let s suppose you chose to make 2 fifths check it off so you ll know that you made that one already
understand yes it doesn t matter to me where you start you just need to start it and if you don t have a particular fraction piece you need to figure out how you can create it
let s try everybody let s try 8 sixths how would you make 8 sixths 8 sixths is in the 2nd column down think about how you would make 8 sixths using the pieces that you have think about how would you make 8 sixths using the pieces that you have
i ll give you some time to think about it and make that card this requires some thinking and some strategizing you may have to use a whole to do something with it
think you can probably talk it over with someone at your table using quiet voices talk if a person gives a suggestion you don t say 0 that s wrong and you don t you listen to what they have to say you think about it and then you discuss whether it will work or not
pieces anybody have a suggestion about how we might do them
you get one whole because in 8 sixths the numerator is bigger than the denominator so you know that it s an improper fraction and you have to and it would be one whole and another fraction so you get your one whole and then you d take your one of the thirds and to make a 6th out of thirds you cut every 3rd in half
card and then you d color in 2 of the 6s okay so this will be 6 sixths and this will be 2 sixths equals 8 sixths okay but remember i want to see 8 sixths on the card listening yes yes did everyone hear what he said
okay i would place it on the card 1st before you glue it and i would check to see if it s really representing 8 sixths you have to divided it in the parts that it is
do we have to what is this going to be that s going to be one whole yeah but what is it going to be fraction i want to see . i want to see 8 sixths on the card
i want to see 8 sixths on the card so you can t just color in one piece and put it in there and tell me it s one whole
card and this is not glued together
this is not glued together because you can t have it glued together you cannot make that 6 sixths like that
that you need to use a ruler because they re equal pieces you i want to see to be able to see 8 sixths you need to do some thinking for yourself you re not relying on his brain i want to see where are you starting
starting you need to think what s the problem what are you trying to do
make it stick 2 pieces think about what you need to do just use the ruler i don t know what you have there
what do you have there there s nothing there i don t know what that is
there s different ways that we can how else can you think about 8 sixths we already know something about 8 sixths think about it e improper fraction okay so what does it really mean
if you use one whole it could not be divided evenly one whole is one whole so you wouldn t have to divide one whole 8 sixths equals what s another way we can write 8 sixths 3rd one and 13rd how come why why is 8 sixths equal to one and 13rd
that s another way you could do you could color in like some people did some people colored in 16th 16th 16th 16th 16th 16th 16th 16th they colored in 81 sixths we could also use and some people didn t trust themselves
whole and i kept saying i want to see the fraction but actually you could do one whole and 13rd right isn t that the same as 8 sixths so 8 sixths equals to and then you show that that is correct but there s another way you could do that too
so just . write the fraction here and then write an equation here and then go on to another one job do you understand what you re doing what s the problem because you have nothing you don t have anything there
okay how are you doing what are you doing i m doing whole one thirds you need to glue it on after you write it down please how are you doing
good once you ve finished one go to the next one
sheet good job
my equation was one +13rd equals 13rd equals 6 sixths and 6 over 6 +13rd equals 2 whoa wait a minute why did you write 6 eighths here right okay double always double check what you ve written
is i m doing 11 fourths okay
one i don t see any cards what are you doing i m doing sixths okay so show me what you re placing on the card please
i had one whole i had i used 16th and i it out to 3 fourths and i them which one are you doing one whole and 3 fourths too okay all right glue it on correctly what are you doing let me see
2 thirds 6 sixths +13rd equals 8 sixths equals one and 2 sixths equals to one and 13rd so you can write that our
explain to me what you re doing please i m doing one and 3 fourths so what i did was i cut out 2 wholes and i separated them into fourths so this was 44th equals 4 fourths equals one whole
and then i separated this into fourths again so there s 3 fourths so 3 parts are shaded and one +3 fourths equals one and 3 fourths do you understand what you re doing tell me what you re doing because i don t understand what you re doing
for this one right now i m doing one and 14th no i want to see what you do with 8 sixths because you that one
mean where s the equation so i did one whole so should i show the fractions on this no i m asking you
done so like with this one go to equal 8 and to equal what 88 why would it equal 8 put the pencil down think about what you did and tell me what you did
questions you said you have one whole
representing 0 i m not sure tell me about that fraction 8 sixths 8 sixths stop coloring that and tell me about the fraction 8 sixths 8 sixths is improper yeah we know that but what does it mean 8 over 6
mean if it s an improper fraction we know that it s made up of a whole and some parts
what are we talking about 8 sixths what does the whole represent 8 you have to try to remember what you re learning as you go along
numerator this is the denominator what fraction are we talking about here represent 6 how many sixths is equal to a whole how many sixths do i need t make a whole
3 you have to start retaining what you okay again 6 sixths is equal to one whole how many pieces are equal to a whole here 6
6 over 6 equal to one whole how many pieces make up the whole 66 this equals 123 you have 3123456 you have 3 over 6 here to one half one half so is this correct
is 6 sixths +3 sixths equal to 8 sixths is 6 sixths +3 sixths equal to 8 sixths or is it equal to 9 sixths 9 sixths so is that a correct representation
be it should be this should be . the whole should not be . are you just guessing right now okay so do you understand what we re doing not really okay so do you understand what makes up a whole and a fraction
what is it that you don t understand can you explain to me what you don t understand so you don t understand this fraction 8 sixths is an improper fraction meaning that it s made up of a whole so it s like we re taking 6 pieces from the 8
leftover 28 sixths -6 sixths equals 2 sixths how many pieces should have been colored here 22 this piece and this piece blank 2 sixths okay
so we have 6 sixths 6 pieces out of 6 pieces equal a whole +2 more pieces out of the 6 pieces equals 82 sixths 6 pieces +2 pieces equals 8 pieces over 6
yes make another card for 8 sixths i need more paper and tell me why you re doing that what are you going to cut out 1st one whole and what s the one whole going to represent 6 sixths 6 sixths 6 pieces out of 6 is equal to what 6 sixths 6 sixths is equal to what
one whole one whole the 13rd could i make it 16th +16th +13rd will it work
yes 5 sixths you guys need to trust your thinking
m how many cards do you have finished right now 3 let me see your cards because i just see fractions on there but i see no equations could you please go back and finish the work and make sure you have equations 15th times 4 equals 4 fifths what does that mean
it means 15th . . 4 times equals 4 fifths what s the next one greater multiplied by 4 equals what s the next 11 whole +3 quarters equals one equals next one didn t i just tell you you didn t have write a whole
there can you please take that one out in there going you should have at least 3 more done by now what are you doing i m folding this in half could you please finish that card so i can see what you re doing
completed i want to see what you re doing work and show me some of your cards that you ve made already please
i cannot hear what you re saying or understand what you re saying to me
saying one whole +3 thirds equals 3 thirds it does not say 3 thirds one whole +3 fourths equals one and 3 fourths one whole plus i need to hear you please one whole plus why do you have to write one whole whole could you erase that please
did you do not have to write one w h 0 l e
whole one whole +13rd equals 8 sixths how can one whole +13rd equal 8 sixths i cannot hear a word you re saying
represents the whole maybe i m too tall
it one whole represents the . the whole of the 6 and the 13rd represents the 8 that and 8 sixths no that s not correct
mean the one whole represents what the 6 what 6 how many 66 sixths 6 over 6
what does the 2 sixths represent the 2 sixths represents . the 8 . the 2 sixths added to the 6 equals the 8 sixths 2 sixths is equal to 13rd it s the same thing wrong it s correct but i want to make sure that you understand what it is that you re doing
6 sixths +2 sixths equals 8 sixths 2 sixths an equivalent fraction to 2 sixths is 13rd use the mathematical language don t be afraid to explain what you have on paper you have to know what it is you ve represented on this card
doing i had to cut one out yeah but that s not what that says so that s not correct so we need to fix that well there s 4 shaded in and there s 5 guys let s go back and review as a class for a minute about what does the numerator tell us
the number how much advance class 4th graders again what does the numerator tell us person one person
new how much part of the whole are shaded how many parts of the whole we re talking about and the denominator tells us in review what the total the total number of pieces when you re explaining the fractions on the fraction cards what mathematical language could you use
using using numerator numerator denominator what else whole whole part
equivalent equals represents you have the idea in your heads guys but translating the ideas onto paper when you put the cards on paper people are having a difficult time explaining what they re doing most of the answers are correct but you have to trust that your answers are correct
you have to talk excuse me about the fractions like you know about the fractions weather just because you re making fraction cards it doesn t change what you know doing if i ask you a question it s not a test
wrong i m trying to get an understanding of what you understand and what you don t understand sometimes i have to ask more than one question and if you don t understand something try to formulate it into a question so that you can get an answer here and this is what is this
there s lots of ways you could do that equation good job here this one is not so describe this one check good job
okay can you share a couple of cards that you made already i made this is the one that i just finished its one and one half okay here one half +one half +one half equals 13 over what was the fraction you were supposed to be making okay and this is another one i did
2.5 okay and another one i did was one and 3 fifths okay and 8 sixths okay good
and don t forget you can do 6 sixths +13rd equals 8 sixths one +13rd equals 8 sixths if you can think of more than one equation to write write it
that i did 13rd it s not making any it s not clear to me and i need to get a stool did you work with did you show that to did you understand explain it to
saying speak so i can hear you i did one whole +one whole +11st of all you have it all joined together so we can t see the differences
okay so you re doing 6 eighths okay so 12345678 okay so you divided it up into 8 pieces okay
no yes okay then you have to trust what you do the reason that you re having difficulty is because you needed to space these out i see what you did but i would put a little bit of space in between so you can clearly see it but if you . if you trust that this is right no matter who s questioning if you can prove that it s right then you should go with it
you should not 2nd guess but i need to make sure that you understand what it is you re doing here and again we need to separate these pieces what does that say 11 half equals okay all right good
doing coming back to you see okay explain it . explain it to me please
to is equal to one and 2 sixths and then 2 sixths is 13rd okay
card i did 6 sixths which is equal 8 and this is sixths and this is 2 sixths i put changed this with 13rd can you show me another card and speak up a little louder please
so . this is i just did one whole +one half which would equal okay good job show me one of your cards please
you don t have to put that you don t have to put 02 s let me see what you wrote okay so you don t need the 02 s one half is simply one half you don t need the 0 over 2 okay w can you get some more cards done because you re not working as quickly as you need to work
yes half 2 and one half and i m going to come back to you in a minute 7 fifths just choose one of your cards that we haven t done already explain to me what you ve done
you how are you doing good how are you doing set all set okay i m going to ask you to share something with me after i talk to doing good okay show me what you did with a different card please
doing okay can you show me one of your cards please that you d like to share minutes i . 1st i . what are you trying to represent on their card okay i . drew 4 wait i drew 10 pieces here okay so you took a whole and you divided it into 10s
and i i 10th okay and then you colored them you colored 4 of them to represent 4 tenths i used 110th +110th +110th +110th equals 4 tenths okay good job you re also checked in
let me sit at this table right here 0 i was moving to okay do you guys you can share with one another okay what are you showing 2 can you please speak up
you i know i m not near you right next to you but could you speak up please go ahead 2 so i did very i m having a hard time hearing you my dear
can you speak up a little louder i m representing 2 fifths okay and i just wrote 15th +15th okay do you understand what you did okay what s going on doing good share something with me please are you finished or did you just stop working
thinking yeah okay could you share one of your cards with me please
your equation has to match the picture so does your equation match the picture no okay is there a way that we can do this so that the equation would match the picture yes okay how would you do it
they re both one whole they re both one whole so how does this picture support this equation you may know equation they both equal one whole they both equal one whole and so you re saying these 3 thirds equal one whole and 6 twelfths +6 twelfths is the same as a whole and a whole is a whole
yeah so does your representation equal your equation yes okay good job remember if you know that you know you keep explaining it okay
way what s up well guys do fractions scare you no yes how many people well cause some people don t like fractions
fractions how many people love working with fractions sometimes very few i just how many people think that they have difficulty with fractions assessment hands down how many people think making fraction cards are helpful
down how many people think making fraction cards are tricky down how many people think writing equivalent equations to the fractions are kind of difficult
okay well fractions for 4th grade is kind of like a big unit especially this year so we ll be doing a lot of work with fractions and fraction cards are a good way for you to think about how to formulate fractions even when you don t have when you only have wholes thirds and fifths this is this is for a couple of days so we re not just going to be working on this today
we re going to be working on this for a couple of days okay so as we bring this lesson to a close everybody needs to stop for a minute what did you learn no let s do it this way what was . what did you learn from working i already asked that question what did you learn by making fraction cards
k equations to add up fractions excuse me equations to add up fractions you re discovering new equations to equal the fractions k there are many ways to make one fraction many ways to represent one fraction else no one else
what was . hard about doing these fraction cards e you have to think about ways to you had to think about ways to represent the fraction
t if you had a simple fraction like 13rd you d have to find a way to make an equation for it so you could do things like 16th +16th okay good i was thinking maybe if you have a im . im . an im improper fraction an improper fraction it s . it s difficult to think of ways to do that like 9 fourths okay
and we didn t . we didn t . we didn t have any fourths yeah so what did you do when you had to make 9 fourths well i cut out 3 wholes and i shaded in 2 of them i shaded in the whole thing for the both for 2 of them and then for one of them i split up into fourths and i shaded in one okay
said yes okay anything else if you okay so as . as hard as this is for you when you re making the cards sometimes it seems like when . when teachers are giving you directions it seem it ll appears easy to me but as i see people doing it i feel like there are some people struggling
how would you have if you were the teacher how would you have given out this lesson differently should i have given you some fourths yes 0 no then you wouldn t be able to think what else would you have added differently would you have done something differently well like you know how you like split some things up
i like some aren t split up just think about it what color 0 you d just color easily that s like having all the pieces together but . but . why do you think that you had to work on fraction cards
l so we could understand like how to make like fractions for like to get starting okay did you learn anything about equivalency all hello yes yes yes okay put your names we re going to end this class period
i need you to make sure your things are to one side can someone tell me which can someone name a fraction that was challenging challenging like 13rd because 0 +13rd okay 13rd
0 over 2 okay what was easy make what was easy for you to make 2 sixths 2 sixths one half one half okay . 33 over 3
one and 3 fourths one and 3 fourths fifths okay tomorrow tomorrow i want to start this class of making a list of what was challenging and what was difficult because we re running out of time now is lunchtime but i really wanted you to think about that for homework tonight as we put our together
please thank you
