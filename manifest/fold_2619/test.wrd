So if I write three in my numerator and one in my denominator, I'm really still just writing the number three. But I can see that when I multiply or add one 16th three times, I have 3 16ths. Kyla, turn around, please. Get focused again. One 16th times three equals 3 16ths.
Okay, do you see that, Akasia? 1234567. Okay, so eight sixths, now we have an improper fraction.
Please stop chitter chatting.
You are sitting there doing nothing.
And the pink. Pink is what, Kyla?
One fourth times something equals 4 16ths. What would our multiplication problem be? Akasia, go ahead. One fourth times. One fourth times, 4 fourths? One four times... Four fourths. Is it four fourths? Yes? One fourth times, how many one fourths did we use? I'm sorry. One 16th, I wrote that wrong, my fault.
I'm just trying to get your... Four 16ths plus one fourth. Akasia, you got it figured out already?
One fourth equals 3 12ths. Yes, Deshanique?
Christian is coming. I can't even the number.
So remember that multiplication is also adding the same number over and over again. So if we want to multiply fractions by whole numbers, we can use repeated addition. To figure out how to multiply those fractions.
Kyla, sit up straight. Christian. Thank you, Paige, I see you listening. Jabari, I see you pretty ready. Justin is ready. That equals 2. Let me see if I can help. That equals eight. 1 second. Eight. 1 second, please.
Stand up and walk, please. All right, Kyla's going to prove to us, Malcolm and Kendall, that one fourth plus 4 16ths equals what, Kyla? How many 16ths? 8. Eight 16ths, eight 16ths should be equal to what other fraction? One half? Very good.
Christian and Deshanique, will you please come show us how you solve the problem?
But, uh, but the denominator would have to stay the same but if you multiplied it by anything but one, it wouldn't be the same. Okay. Let's think too, though, about what three divided by one means. Remember that fractions also represent division problems. So three divided by one equals what? Three. Three. Three divided by one equals three.
Yeah, so. You just, I mean...
Put your hands down and pay attention. DeAnthony. So how did you guys come up with all of those sixths in the first place? How did you decide you needed that many? Four times eight, uhh, four times two sixths and we didn't have enough, so we added... Can you show me two sixths, please?
Are we allowed to do our work under this? Yeah, of course.
Four what? Right there? Yep.
Thank you, that's better. I'm glad you're excited, but it's way too noisy. Umm.
In the past few days or probably a week I've asked you guys a number of times what does it mean to multiply. If I'm doing three times two, what's another way to describe that problem? I'm multiplying three times two. What are two ways to solve that problem?
It's not important really, right now, just ignore. One fourth. Please. One fourth, thank you. And I'm hearing a lot of talking again. DeAnthony, you haven't raised your hand to let me know you need me to do anything. Better?
Okay, panther? Pride So one 12th times three equals what? One 12th times three equals what? What is it, Kendall? 3 12ths. One times three is three. Three can also be written three divided by one, that's still the number three, right?
What would one half of one sixth be? One 12th. One 12th. If we take one sixth and fold it in two parts or divide it into it is one 12th. And one 12th is what color? Blue. Red. Or is it red? Actually. It was supposed to be brown. Blue? Okay.
Akasia, did you find a fraction that equals 3 12ths? One 12th. Does one 12th equal 3 4ths? No. One fourth, one fourth. One fourth. Show me, please. I don't see it on your desk. I see that you have it out, but can you please show me. Four times three. Right here. Does one fourth equals 3 12ths? Yes. Yes, it does.
Okay, two sixths times four. So they have 1234 sets of two sixths, right, Jabari? Yeah. Okay, and Akasia, what was their solution then? Two sixths times four equals? Two six times. Right here. Nicholas, two six times four equals? Is what? Eight 6ths.
I've probably said ten times since we started stop whispering. This is what it should sound like. Malcolm? Akasia. Go ahead. Umm... One 16th times what equals one fourth? Four? Yes.
The number tells you like like like how much it is in the whole. How many what in the whole? What do you mean by how much? How much whatever you're... How many... Parts. Oh, parts! ...Equal parts. How many equal parts. So, Jabari, how many equal parts do you need to make a whole if each part is one sixth.
Okay. Because you're playing with that. I was, they weren't. It doesn't matter. Okay, you guys are going to use your fraction strips if necessary. I need all eyes up here. Eyes, Jabari. If you want to use your fraction strips to help you solve these problems, you can.
Are we getting our work done? No.
Calm down. Okay. Kyla, that's not a reduce your time right now, please stop. Mmm, Maisie, how many sixteenths are equal to... We don't really need this. How many sixteenths are equal to one fourth?
All right, so today we are going to use our fraction strips for two things. All eyes up here, please. All hands empty. We've been doing a lot of adding and subtracting fractions and finding common denominators, but some of us are still kind of struggling with that. So I want to go back to using the actual physical model that you can touch and see so you can remember again.
It's easy. One fourth times three. Deshanique has it. Paige has it. Malcolm hasn't done it yet. Show me, please. You show me what 1 fourth times three looks like.
Panther? Pride. Thank you for your patience. One 4th times 3. So, Jabari, what did we figure out? One four times three equals? Three fourths. Can you please turn in this direction? Thank you. One times three equals three. Four times one equals four. Three fourths. Okay.
Four. Okay, can you bring your cards up to show me up here, please? Okay. Boys and girls, I'm still hearing so much whispering. Maisie's going to come show us how many sixteenths are equal to one fourth. We just figured out 3 12ths equals one fouth. Let's see how many sixteenths equal one fourth.
If you have three and you divide it by one, our answer is? Three. So if we multiply one times three, we get three. If we multiply twelve times one, we get twelve. Please do not kick or moan or groan. Thank you. Thank you.
Find another shape that's equivalent to 3 12ths and show me, please. 3 12ths. Show me on your desk. Is that it? Show me, please. Line them up next to each other.
Okay, so 4 16ths plus one fourth equals one half. So we've been doing these problems, but what have we been doing instead of modeling them? Adding them. What did we have to do in order to solve these problems when we didn't have our models, Kyla? Add. We're still adding, but what did we do differently? What did we have to do first?
What did you use to make two sixths? Okay, so, Jabari, do you see how two one sixths makes two sixths? Yes? Okay, and how many sets of two sixths did we need, Jabari? Two. How many did we need? What was our original problem? I don't know if you can see it over here. Ian and Deshanique, step to the side for a moment, please. What was our original problem, Jabari? Two 6ths times four. Go sit down. What? Two 6ths times 4.
What would three thirds be? If you have three parts, three parts altogether, you have three parts of the three altogether.
One 16th times three, where are you showing me on your desk... It might equal one sixth, but can you please show me? Kyla. Maisie, one 16th times three equals? 3 16ths. 3 16ths, may I have? Panther. Pride.
Please stop whispering. Malcolm, please stop. Umm, not sure, you go ahead and press focus. Right there. It's just light, it's okay.
Akasia, please do your thinking inside your head right now for a little bit. What was that? Yep.
Kyla, try it, please. 4 16ths plus one 4th. Christian? Did you figure it out? Is that why you're waving your hand around? No. Okay, so Christian and Deshanique. I see, it looks like Kendall also has it figured out. DeAnthony, do you have it figured out? Panther? Pride. Panther? Pride.
I see Maisie and Leila have free one 12ths put on their desk. Please do it. And especially share with Jabari. Paige has her 3 one 12ths. Malcolm has has 3 one 12ths. Malcolm, can you organize those? Line them up next to each other, please. Deshanique, do you have your 3 one 12ths? Put them in front of you on your desk. Umm, okay, got it.
Ian, thank you, I see that you're quiet. Christian, put that away. Maisie, how did you figure out that one 16th times three equals 3 16ths? Oh, well, the first way I knew is because we did it before and. Did we do it before? Yeah, we did. We did.
Good. Kendall is working it out. I got it! Kendall's got it. I got it. Justin needs to lift his head up off his desk and give it a try. And go put those cushions back in the classroom library. Thank you. Take Ian's, too. Maisie's got it. Akasia's got it.
I'm sorry, I'm going to wait for a second. Really, Nicholas? All the little noises need to stop. That shows me you're not focused at all. And it disturbs other people around you. They stop. Yes, Ophelia?
How many sixths does it take to make one? How many sixths does it take to make one, Jabari ? Jabari, what does the denominator tell us? What does the denominator of a number tell us, Colby?
Can I go to the bathroom? What was that? What was the question, Kendall?
Jabari, you need six sixths to make one whole. Six sixths equals one, right? Okay, you guys are going to try some of these on your own. Yes, you may now.
How did you get those eight sixths, though? How did you decide that you needed eight sixths? We put, uhh, all of our sixths together. One second. 1 second, please, Kendall, you can hear that children are still making noises and not really focused on listening. Getting better. Put that down.
Two sixths times four, give it a try. Two sixths times four. How would we do that? Work it out, please, in front of you. Two sixths times four. It's not 8 12ths, work it out. Two sixths times four. Work it out before you show all your answers. Show me. What's the problem? No, show me. Two sixths times four.
Panther? Pride. Panther? Pride. One of your classmates has a request for some silent time, and I don't disagree. Spend the next few minutes working without talking. You're facing your own paper, Kyla. Akasia already. Yes, Leila? Umm.
This is one 16th. Blue is? Yeah. Okay, so red is one. Whoa. Whoa.
Okay, let's prove it. Okay, so one half also equals? Everybody. Everybody. Eight 16ths. Thank you.
Nicholas has it. Oh. I did it. Panther? Pride. Ophelia , I still see you talking. Akasia, one 16th times three equals... One 6th?
Umm, Akasia, please get focused.
Please try it with your fraction card. One 16th times three. Kyla, you should be solving this problem with your fraction strips. One 16th times three. Deshanique's thinking she has it. Colby's about to try.
Okay, four 16ths plus one fourth. I'll try to help you get it off the camera. It's okay. Everybody has them in front of them anyway. Go ahead, share with your classmates. So how we figured this problem out is... 1 second, let me see if your classmates are listening to you. Hands are empty. Eyes and ears are on Christian and Deshanique. Justin, head up off your desk. Akasia, in your chair.
Let's try a different one seeing as I'd already done that problem. How about one fourth times three? One four times three. Show me, please. Show me, show me, show me. I know a lot of you are doing it in your head, but please show me how you would model it with the fraction strip. I don't have a third, so I can't show you. One fourth times three.
Christian, come on, quickly. Okay. Okay, so how about if we added 4 16ths plus one fourth, what fraction would we come up with? 4 16ths plus one 4th.
Umm, raise your hand if we need one more example of multiplying fractions. Deshanique, you want one more? Yeah. I want one. You know this already, though, don't you? Nicholas, let me give you a challenge problem and see if you can figure it out, right? Me too. How about two sixths times four? Two sixths times four. I'm changing a little bit now because our numerator isn't one anymore.
One 16th times four equals one fourth. If we were to just multiply this... One times four equals 4. 16 times one equals 16, and then we know that one fourth is an equivalent fraction to 4 16ths. Wait until Christian comes back, please.
Panther. Pride. So if, oh, I forgot to put one thing up there. What is one half of one 6th? One half of what? Hand raised, please. Boys and girls, I need all of you thinking, I see Kendall is thinking, and Nicholas is thinking. Nicholas, you don't even have it there.
I wrote that very wrong. So 4 16ths, oh, yes. Hold on here. One 16th. One 16th times something equals one fourth. Thank you, Maisie. Now I don't know. You do know. One 16th times something, sorry Maisie.
Okay, but I was thinking, Ophelia, when we did it I think we might have done one 8th next. Thank you. So let's go to one 8th, please. And one 8th is purple. So if we fold a one fourth in half, we got 8ths. So purple is one 8th. Yes, Ian? How, wait, where was number one, why was that one there?
Nicholas keep the congratulations inside your head for a few minutes. So it's okay, that's not a big deal.
I really appreciate those of you who are using your self control to remember to raise your hands.
Three or two one 12ths? What was that? Three or two? What is the problem saying? Three times. Three. So three of the ones 12ths. Nicholas. Okay. Is it? Show me, please. Show me, please.
I can just multiply, and I know it's three times two, but what's another way, Paige? Adding three. Add. So multiplying can be accomplished by just multiplying and maybe knowing your basic facts or you can add. Three times two means three two times, so three plus three. Three times three, of course, means three plus three plus three. Three three times.
3. I need three. 3. One 12th times 3 means 3 one 12ths, so get 3 one 12ths, please. Three one 12ths. Akasia, please share with Kyla. Or share with Colby actually.
DeAnthony and Colby, you're listening, you're not whispering at all. Go ahead. So how we solved the problem was, we put one sixth right here. And one fourth right here. Did you put one sixth right here? How many sixths did you put here? How many? Four. 4 16ths plus one fourth equals. One half. Can you show me, please?
Okay. Okay, so one and two sixths, once they turned the improper fraction into a mixed, mixed number, they had one and two sixths. So, Jabari, how many sixths does it take to make one? One.
Boys and girls. Kyla.
What does three over one mean? Or three first? What does that mean, Ophelia? Well, a girl means that I know why, uh, but, uh, it was the, it was done because, uh, because if you multiply 16 by three, it wouldn't make any sense because then you'd have three something something and not really ready to do that math.
Okay, so. Not right now. You could do that. You can work it up that way, or you can work it up with a strip.
Your classmates aren't ready. Deshanique, Ophelia. We are listening. Malcolm, you must listen to each other. Akasia, have a seat. Kyla, put both of your feet on the floor and listen.
Umm, I would like to find, please find... How many 16ths are equal to one fourth. Show me on your desk, please. How many sixteenths are equal to one fourth? We know three 12ths and one fourth are equal.
Okay, so one fourth, oh, there it is, it's brighter. One fourth equals... Okay. One fourth equals 4 16ths. So what kind of multiplication problem could we write... To describe that?
It's not 8 12ths. Ian, you're going to have to cooperate with these two. We need to share because. 2 sixths times 4. Did you make a substitution or?
Is this wrong? Miss, is this wrong?
I don't really remember.
Okay, Malcolm, when we did three times two, we needed how many threes? Three. How many threes did we need? One, one. One. How many threes did we need? Two, two, two. Two. So if I'm multiplying one 12th times three, how many one 12ths do I need? How many? Okay, when we do three times two. Two, two, two. One 12th times three, how many  one 12th do I need?
And... This is the microphone, Jabari, so you hear what I'm saying to you guys. Yes, so they can hear you also. Umm, Kendall, what fraction is this blue color? One third. One third. I don't have marker colors to match everything.
Did any fall? Three fourths, that's important. Jabari, please show me one fourth times 3.
One 12th times three. What does that mean? One 12th times three. Malcolm, how could you start to figure out how to solve that problem? I used... I used one of these twelves. Okay. And use all my threes.
Boys and girls, I'm just going to pause again for a second. I'm hearing so much squirming, it's very distracting. So one 12th times three four equals 3 12ths. I'd like you to see if you can find another fraction in your bag that is equivalent to 3 12ths.
DeAnthony, you can you please get this here? What was your way? Maybe. It's definitely one fourth. All right.
Deshanique, we should be quiet and listening to our classmates. Akasia , listening, please. Boys and girls, I'm listening for silence right now. Maisie, lift your head up.
Kendall, they're here, I'm sorry. Nicholas. Wow. We didn't even last for 1 minute. Paige, it's silent time right now.
You know it is something? On the alphabet. On the alphabet? Yeah. What do you mean?
Turn around. Show me. Jabari, show me. Two sixths times four. There aren't any, how can you make 2 thirds? And you might have to participate with somebody next to you also. Okay.
How many 16ths equal one fourth? One 16th?
Who can tell me which color I need to pull out next? Raise your hand if you can tell me. What color is next, Akasia? One 5th? Umm, we had one half, one third, one fourth. What do we do now? I'm remembering that when we were folding these, if I folded a one fourth in half, what would each half be?
I see Deshanique talking right now. I see Malcolm moving. Yes, Colby?
It's more problems with addition and subtraction of fractions and then a few problems with multiplication of fractions. Raise your hand if you feel like we need to practice more multiplication of fractions. We only really did one example, that just reminded me. Okay, have a seat, please, Kyla. Thank you. So when we multiply fractions, it's just like repeated addition. So what would one 16th times three be? One 16th times three?
We started out using the fraction circles to add and subtract and also the pattern block. But now we're going to try it with the fraction strip. So you have another way to really see what you're doing when you're adding and subtracting your fractions. And we're also going to use them to model multiplication, which we haven't really done before.
Four 16ths plus one fourth. You can either do it with the model or you can figure it out using common denominator. Colby and DeAnthony, stop.
Thank you, Ian. Thank you, Kendall. Ummm, Kendall, you look like you're close to a solution for this problem, actually. Jabari, can you, Jabari will you please walk? Kendall and Deshanique and Ian, could the three of you come up here and show us how you solve the problem?
Yeah, because it is aqua. It is aqua. Thank you, Colby, for raising your hand. Okay, and white is one 6th. Everybody get your white ones out. One 6th? Yes, Nicholas? Uhh.
Thank you, Deshanique. Thank you, Ian. Thank you, Kendall and Nicholas and Malcolm. Okay, 16 times one is 16. Now, Maisie, you said I moved the one down here and I just need to clarify that. You place it down. Thank you. Akasia, Kyla, I need you paying attention. Jabari, the learning is occurring over here, turn around, please. Why did I put the one down here?
Okay, two 4ths.
First we have, first we have to multiply. Multiply what? Four times four equals six. Equals? I mean 16. Okay, so we would have had to find a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number, right? Mm-hmm. Okay, so 4 16ths plus, what would this number be? Four fourths.
So the first problem we're going to try is... And you're going to actually have to, actually, I'll use one of the smaller fractions to start with. So let's try one 12th times three. How could you solve the problem one 12th times 3?
Once you show me. Is this three fourths right here? That's three fourths, right? And you said it equals 3 12ths? What's this?
Yep, looks good. I need my bag. You don't need your bag.
So, Akasia, here's one fourth. One 16th times... All right. Colby? Do you know what, boys and girls? Too many of us are not following the rules.
And that, that you taught us to move the one hand down here and so then you would do three times one. Okay, one times three equals... Three Three. And then.
Paige, it's their turn to share, get ready to listen, please.
