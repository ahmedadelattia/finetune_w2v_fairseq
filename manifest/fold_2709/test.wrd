I think that's... that's Colby's. I think it is.
Two, three. Two reds. Two reds. And one blue. And one blue. Alright, so let's take a look. Right now we have five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. We've done twelve spins. Oh, actually, I think we were only supposed to do twenty... uh, to do six a day. Oh, well, that's okay. We'll do it for Monday. Um, we got excited. Um, alright, so we have five, six, seven yellows. Two blues. And three reds.
Okay. So those faces. The two-dimensional ones would be quadrilaterals. What else? What else, Luke? They have the same number of edges. They have the same number of edges. What else do they have the same number of? Um, corners? Corners. M'kay? Um... Who sees something else? They have the same number of vertices. Vertices, which is another word for what? Bottom. Nobody should be writing anything right now. Your eyes should be looking at those two pictures.
Okay. I'm gonna write today's date, too. Madison. I think that blue and red will get the same amount of spins. Oh, good prediction.
And I want you to be thinking, is this game gonna be more luck or strategy? When I... Luck. Well, I hadn't told you the directions yet. So listen for the directions. The first thing you're going to do... Charlie, can you come grab Miss Name] a dice? And it can be any... any of the numbers. It can be the one through six.
Miss Eunice, can you throw this away for me? Thank you. Whoops. Thank you, mister, for letting me borrow that. Sweetie, I'm gonna slide behind you. Thank you. Alright, get to a place where you can see, please. We're gonna spend a couple minutes here together.
Honey, is this your science experiment? Josh, innappropriate.
Can you write a fraction... First of all, representing...
What two numbers would that come between? Three and four. And who thinks they can come and show me where it would come? So Josiah, will you do that for me? Come and show me where it would come. What we're going to work on today is refining the ability to, um, compare numbers and think about where they would be on a number line. Do you want me to just put a dot, or... Just put a dot, put an arrow, just kind of put it above it. Okay. Who agrees with that? Is that where you had yours?
Over here? I'm also gonna pass out your homework for tonight. It is a review of what we've done. It's a review of equivalent decimals.
I'm gonna let her do it, though, just 'cause you helped me before. Okay. Okay, woah, woah, woah, where'd that six come from? Did you know that? Did you see that six? Okay, did you write down the first six? But which side do I write it on? You're gonna write it... Yours is gonna look exactly like hers. Okay, roll it again.
Anything higher than a two point twenty-five or whatever? Alright, let's see what she got.
Okay, and you have to copy the same thing.
One point twelve would be less than, okay? Alright, we're going to spend about ten to fifteen minutes... playing this game. Yes, buddy? Um, what if they're equal. Well, if they're... oh, if they're equal. Hm, you would have to probably redo it. Or a tie-breaker. Or a tie-breaker. You could do that, too. Maybe you just want to decide before you start the game.
Madison, do you mind walking around, pushing in chairs so we'll be ready after lunch? Colby, walk on, make sure we have all the dice put back in the container.
It is correct, it's correct. Just different ways of saying. Three and seventh tenths is just another way of saying three and seventy hundredths. That is why I think three and seven tenths is greater than three and sixty-five hundredths. Did anyone draw a picture? Hole up if you drew pictures. Using X's or a hundreds chart or dots. That's kind of a lot. You would've had to draw like... seven tens or seven... yeah.
Homework, yes. I like how I see Kashish] writ... drawing some pictures. Maybe similar to what we did, um, back before the game. Keep writing or write in your agenda book. Who has one to share? Even if it's just part. Madison.
What was the reduce one? What was the lowest you could go? Eleven over eighteen. Eleven over eighteen, that was pretty interesting. Could you show me the fraction of the days we still ha... So we could say we've had eleven eighteenths of our school year already. That's pretty... What fraction tells us how much to go? How many more days to go? Eighty more. Right? No. Fraction. Show me in a fraction. We've already said there's seventy days. And if it has zeroes, what can you do? Reduce it?
Actually, will you pass it to a friend? Okay. Pass it to a boy. Okay, so this is round two. Do you see what I mean by this is luck?
That works, too, m'kay? I want you to correct that, okay? Alright, the next one looks like this.
Kay, so these are numbers in between three and four. Um... Show me on your whiteboard where you think three and seventy-three hundredths would fall. Josh, why'd you pick that? Because three point seven, and then you just need to go up three more. And then you have it. Three what more? Um, three more tenths. Would that be tenths?
Okay. David. Um...
Just don't bump the camera.
Does everybody have a partner? No. Kay, I would like for... Ryan, who are you working with? You gotta get started. Who are you working with?
'Cause if it was a strategy game, I would be trying to make decisions about what place to put them in. Okay, you ready, Garett? We're going left to right, four times. Okay. Five. Oh, that's gonna be challenging. Four. Four. Okay, so we need... Oh. One. One. What? Oops. Two. Two. Yay, we got a point. Is that a correct state... or number sentence?
I roll a two. I want you to roll it... hadn't told you what to do ye... with this yet. Okay, I roll. I got a three. She got a three. So let's do this. You want to play class against Miss Courson for a couple of rounds? Yes. Alright, sh... y'all got a three. I got a two. So who got less? You. Right, I have less. So what I'm going to do is, how many circles are on my recording sheet?
Kay.
And I'm gonna roll it two times. Alright. I got a two, and watch what I'm doing. When I roll the dice, I'm putting it in the order... Oh, oh. ...that I roll it, okay? So a strategy game would be, I would have to maybe decide where to put it.
How can we describe my spinner, by the way? What could we say? The yellow part is two fourths. Yeah, we could say that two fourths of it is shaded. Do have an equal amount of shading? Like is it three equal colors? No. No? Okay, so we could say one half or two fourths are shaded yellow. Red is one fourth, blue is one fourth. So do you see where Luke may have gotten that prediction? In a spinner game, he thinks that more than likely will land quite  a bit there.
Keep working. because it's, um, far... it's farther in the lumber... in the number line, and it's also, um, no... it's larger... it, um... The seven is maybe seventy? Oh, yeah, look at... He looked at his tenths place. Did you hear what he just said? He compared the tenths place and he knew that seven was greater than what? Six, yeah. Brandon, what'd you get?
Instead of playing video games?
That was a good try. Hexagon? No. Day of the week chart?
Oh. Just do it anyway, let's watch what's gonna happen. What? Whose paper is this a true sentence on? Yours. So guess who gets the point. You. Aw! Okay, so... Watch what we're gonna do. Miss Courson gets the point. Because that made an accurate and true number sentence. Two and twenty-six hundredths is less... That's why y'all were like, "Yeah!" and I was like, "Oh, no." See, I knew I'd beat you already. And two and sixty-four.
You can... we're gonna do the prompt on the board in just a minute in our math notebook. You went really fast, huh? You want to play a couple more points? You can play a couple more points. So is this my number? He's gonna finish rolling all the way across.
Okay, woah, woah, woah, I didn't see a one, I just saw a two.
But Josh says red will have the most? Because you guys just jinxed it. What do y... what does that even mean?
On this number line. Where would it fall on this one? So now you're having to compare point seventy-three with another number. She put it between three point five and four. Who agrees with that? Alright, um... We're gonna actually make a different number line. Watch this one. You ready? I'm going back up to the first one.
And what we're gonna do is I have two spinners up here. And every day, we're going to take the spinner. Gonna let a girl spin it six times, a boy spin it six times. And then we're gonna talk... we're gonna graph the results up here in a tally chart. Who has a prediction about... what the, um... what the results are gonna be? Or anything related to this experiment. What do you think, Luke? Take a couple of predictions.
Then we're going to play a partner game. That I think I might pick the partners. We'll have to think about that for just a minute. Do we have everybody here today from both classes, right? We have nobody out. Okay, so we have all twenty-five. That means we'll have to have one group of three. Jos√© is out, okay, so we do have an even group. Alright, um... First think I do is I have... I want to show you my two number lines. I'm actually gonna put a third one up there, but we were kind of running out of room. Take a look at the first number line. The one up top. How's it spaced?
Okay, pass them to me, okay? Extra, extra, read all about it. Thank you, Ben.
It'll take a while to see the pattern, won't it? And what we'll do is we'll do it for the weekend. And for Monday. Okay, this is our first one. Take a look at... you should be looking at my picture right now. Okay, we're gonna put this down because I want you to look at my picture. Who can describe this? Can you see it?
One ten. Do you need to circle one ten? Yes, I do need to circle one ten. Think if we can reduce more. Look and see. Yes, I need to circle one ten. How many more circles will I have before the end of this school year? Seven more. Kay? Do either of them get a triangle? No. Square? No. Star? Yes.
And this has to be able to go under your bridge, kay? I'm shooting for our ceremony being on February sixteenth. That's that Thursday. The bridge-breaking ceremony.
We're gonna play! Okay, listen.
The greater than, yes. Don't forget to correct it on your paper. Wait, it's already correct on our paper. Oh, that's right, I need to correct it. Duh. Okay. So we get a point. Okay, you got a point, I got a point.
Could you play this at home?
Huh?
Is it closer to three point seven or three point eight? Where would it fall? Three point seven. It would be the same thing as three point seven. I mean three point seven zero. Well, it wouldn't be the same thing. But it would round. Well, right, it would round to three point seven. Okay. And could you round it to the closest hundredth. What would that look like? Um... That... that... that wouldn't really make any difference. It'd still be three point seven, three point seventy.
Okay. So we've got a cube. Turn to your elbow partner and tell them something about a cube. What do you notice is under the number one?
Alright, we're gonna play a partner game. Kind of similar to the one we were doing the other day, where we were using the, um, decimal cards, and you were... and you were putting them in order.
What I was recommending this for was if you got something like this. And if it was tricky and if you needed the picture. Okay, it would help with maybe something like this. Would that be less than or greater than?
You know what I might do is kind of stagger it. I think that helped. A little bit better. Look at this a little bit better. What's different about this number line?
Wait a minute. Woah, stop, stop, stop. What di... Remember, what did you roll? Did you roll...?
Oh, that's right. That's why I did it twice. Okay, thank you.
PW, I put PS nintey-six because you see they've named it differently. This comes from a problem-solving book. Yeah, that's why it says PS ninety-six, not PW. Normally, we put PW ninety-six. Oh, it says PS on here, too. It says PS on the paper... That's why I just didn't want to confuse you by putting PW.
And four. Alright, look at your number. Whose is correct? Laura's is. Because hers is actually less than two and forty-four hundredths. So who gets that point? And I don't care where you guys try to write it. Somewhere on the paper. So that means hers it correct, yours is not. What are you gonna have to do to make that right?
Okay, we gotta stop; let's erase that. Hold on just a minute. Don't forget, what is the first step of this game?
My mom is coming. I know. Why does it need to go under? It has to go under... It has to fit because remember it has to be a certain amount of inches off the ground.
Six. Think of a dice or a box; how many sides are there?
Okay, now you're ready to start playing. Who's gonna go first?
Yes. Question: if we were going to round this number... Look at what it's closest to. What would it round to?
Since you just jinxed it, I think red will... I think red will, um, be the, um, be the best since, um, once you spin it, and you probably spin it at the red or the blue, it'll probably go around and... and stop on, um, where the red is. Well, and let me just stop you for just a minute. Hey, Luke, why did you think that yellow will most likely have the most? 'Cause it has two squares. Yeah, let's take a look at this, folks. I want you to look at... at what, um, my spinner looks like.
You want to write it in word form?
You take the pencil point. You put the spinner... Put it, or put the paperclip and the pencil on top of the spinner. Boom. Now, you gotta move your hand out of the way. And what you're gonna do is you're go... we're gonna count. You'll let me know how many yellows you had, how many reds, and how many blues, okay? Alright, let's see, um...
Okay. Straight lines in... Straight lines in them or curved lines?
Yes, yes, baby? Um, can we put up our whiteboards? Wait, hold on, and we'll do the whiteboards when we're going to get, um, partners, and... and in our re... transitioning. Okay. The first thing that you are going to do is I want you to take a look at your recording sheet. You're going to play five rounds. David, can you slide up, sweetie? You're going to play five rounds of this game.
Have you started working yet? No. Okay, let's go, come on. Who are you with? Joey or Brandon? Joey, who's your partner? Okay, get started. How we doin', ladies? Who's the less-than person?
Okay, does everybody have a recording sheet?
No! Four and fifty-four hundredths is less than... So who won that point?
Okay. Make your predictions based on what you know about math and spinner games. M'kay, we probably need to be thinking that way. Not necessarily jinxing and stuff like that. Blue... will have the most. I'm going to take one more. I want a lady this time.
Madison said... Okay, I said I was only going to take one more, so put your hands down, we gotta move on. Blue... plus red... will equal what?
Okay, you gotta do all four of 'em, all four of 'em going across. Did you write your five? He's on the second one. He's on the second point, so you should've written a five.
And I'm just gonna do a few predictions today because I want us to be able to adjust or confirm as we go through the month of... of February. Yellow most likely. Put a thumb up if you agree with that. Most likely, will have the most. Gonna need someone to help me with this, okay. Who has another prediction. Josh.
Okay. When you go with your partner, you're gonna put your whiteboards away for me. Friends, we cannot leave your materials around for when my homeroom comes back, okay? So you gotta make sure you get up the things you need to get up. Um, you could take this page home. I am going to put a prompt on the board. I'm gonna have you write in your math notebook, and then we're gonna share at the very end of class after this game. I think I will let you pick your own partners.
Yes, because it's gonna look like your recording sheet. But it says four, one, six... Oh, is it? I'm sorry. I was thinking it was all... yes. Okay, just do... just do the first one then. Just do the twos.
She's... the reason I'm having you do this on the back is because I want you to use the front. You're gonna get with a partner in a minute and play this. Yeah. Right now I'm just demonstrating the game. And you're gonna... you're gonna be one person and I'm gonna be the other person. Y'all are gonna try to beat me. M'kay? Alright, so the next thing you do is you would do some type of fair way to see who's gonna go first. Rock paper scissors.
Goodbye, guys. I brought my whole big binder for nothing.
And I'll write your homework on the board. Will you p... pass this down to Brandon and Audrey, please? The game sheet that you guys had today. You could take that home with you. Charlie, you should be in your seat now. And I think someone might be missing their math notebook because it's been up here on the table.
Not sure what that other notebook is, but keep it in your math notebook. Does everybody have a homework for tonight? Uh, Miss Courson, I don't get it. Which number is larger? Three and seven tenths or three and sixty-five hundredths. Explain your thinking using pictures, numbers, and words. Got about four more minutes. Keep writing.
Madison's already started. Luke, were you pushing in chairs for me, sweetie?
Reduce it. And they're both divisi... And do you remember... I see a lot of thirty-five over ninety. So what I want you to do is to look both at thirty-five and at nintey. See if it can be... See if they have any factors in common.
I had to get you one that was more challenging. To be able to play. Pass it ou... Oh, I took 'em all; that didn't help. I guess you can't pass that out.
Brandon, if you need to go and do the blinds... He got yellow, yellow... Sit down, sit down. Brandon, you can go get it out of your eyes. Go do the blinds. Okay. What'd you get, boys?
Wait. The closest whole number. That means you're gonna have point zero zero. Point zero zero. You're rounding it to the nearest whole number. Which is gonna be this guy right here. So is it gonna be closer... Let's take a look at it. Is it closer to three point... uh, three or four? Four. What's it closest to if it's right here? Four. Okay. Can you round it to the closest tenth? Yes.
Is that about what we said might happen? Whose prediction is that close to?
Yellow. Okay. Let me find someone who's been on task. I'm gonna pick a girl and a boy. Alright. And do you guys know how to use a paper clip spinner? Yes. Alright, so what I'm gonna do... Put your hand down please. I'm going to take it to a hard surface. Can I see someone... does anyone have a pencil closeby? Charlie can you grab a pencil from your desk? Thank you, bud. Alright. What you're going to do is you're going to take it to a flat surface. Just one of the areas close by.
Yeah, make sure you fix it or Momma will think I'm teaching you all the wrong things, okay? Here we go. Okay. Oh, I like that, a tally chart, that works. Okay, who's my greater than and... and less than, boys? I am greater than. Okay. And you're less than all the way down? Okay, whose turn is it to roll the dice?
Uh-oh. Who's doing... okay, so who's rolling for the fourth round? Did y'all just get a tie score? Y'all both got one point one four and one point one four? No. M'kay, let's do number three then. Um, I'm going... let me help you. Aren't you glad I'm here? Here, grab the dice. Okay.
Girls, your eyes should be looking at my two pictures. Vertices is the same thing as... Points. Points, corners. Also they have the same number of faces, which are gonna be your flat surfaces. Alright, um... Do we have enough, really, to be able to talk about what our pattern's gonna be?
It was close, is it close? Three plus two is five. I was gonna say that, um... Okay. I was gonna say that red and blue... for he predictions, I was gonna say that red and blue have the same amount. Red and blue will have... The same amount. The same amount as the... at the end? Yes. Okay, we're gonna stop here. There's one more game that I want to teach you, but we need to move on to what we're gonna do in math today. There's gonna be another game where we're adding ounces each day. Ooh. M'kay, so we'll catch up tomorrow.
Yeah, that's instead of playing video games. But I don't get time to play video games anymore. Well, I can't.. I'm not allowed to play on weekend... on weekdays, but on weekends.
So we don't do that... we don't do that right here?
A hundred and ten percent. If somebody tells you that you give a hundred and ten percent, that's what it would look like. If you were drawing a picture. Even though it doesn't go that high; it's supposed to be a hundred percent. Right.
Extra, extra. Those papers.
Laura's gonna go first. Alright, Laura, roll the dice. So your first number... You've gotta do four numbers. Your first one's a two. Yours, too. Alright? And, Laura, roll it again; you're gonna do the whole first point. Four. Let's look at that. Okay, so two point twenty-four is gonna be less than something.
Is it one? Okay so round three... This is fun. Isn't this a luck game? It is a luck game, it just depends... Uh-oh.
Jinx bad luck. It means it probably do the exact opposite of what you think. You think? Well, maybe you jinxed it and it's gonna be blue. Oh, my goodness. Everybody's jinxing it. Blue's gonna have the most.
What's one clue that you can reduce that? They're both even. They're both even. So you know they're gonna be divisible by two. While we're doing this, do any of our numbers need part?
Let me erase this real quick. Okay. Read that top number for me. Three and seventy-three hundredths. Three point seventy-three. Three and seventy-three hundredths. Looking at... We'll call this... Why don't we just call this line number one? Looking at num... line number one, where would you put that number? Show me. You don't have to draw the whole number line. If you just want to kinda put the number that would be... come before... Maybe draw the segment. You don't have to draw zero to ten.
Yeah. It's starting... What's our f... Oh, you know what? I forgot to put my last point. Alright. So what are my two whole numbers? That it's between.
Right. Okay. Um, let's take a look at our February calendar. Trying to think what was in here. And I have some new pictures. When's my next birthday in February? Huh?
Okay. Is that how y'all are playing it, where you're both doing it...?
Seven eighteenths left in the school year. That's what I got, too. Seven eighteenths and eleven eigteenths. Those were the two numbers. Could you compare them? Using a less-than, greater-than, or equal-to symbol? Compare the fraction that's showing the days we've already done, the days we have left. M'kay? Good deal.
Thank you, thank you very much. This is turned on, too, right? Okay. Alright, got everybody seated. Is everybody in a place where they can see, where they can participate? Boys, can you see there? Okay. We need to do calendar for two days. We did not do it yesterday. So we're going to add two days, starting with, to our number line. Yesterday was the one hundred and ninth day of school. And today is the one hundred and tenth day of school.
So what do you have to do if he got that point? That means yours isn't right, you have to correct it. Okay, 'cause you can't go home with the wrong stuff on your paper, right? Okay. And now he'll do the next four rolls for the third point.
Like this? Like when people do that?
Alright, let's take a look at, um, a couple new things I want to show you. The first thing I want us to do is we're going to add... We're gonna talk about our decimal. We now have a mixed number, don't we? So I'm gonna color two days. And I wonder if you see... a couple different ways that we could write it. We can create an equivalent decimal. Look at what I'm doing.
There are five. All the way down my paper, I'm going to go less than, less than, less than. All the way down. Alright? So greater than? Y... don't do it yet. Flip it over on the back. Yes. Go ahead and you guys put greater than. Five times. Five times. Greater than, greater than, greater than, greater than. Huh? Four times. I ran out of board. Here. Whoops.
And a one. Okay, so she rolled a six, three, one, one. And one of these is correct, the other one is not.
Okay. So let's do that real quick. Roll the dice. You only needed one dice, ladies. So which one are y... okay. That's fine. Okay. So, Laura, you are less than all the way down.
He'd be getting my mitten, my little wipey mitten. Share with Aria. 'Cause I saw you having some great pictures there, you could share with me, too. Here, read yours to me instead of my mitten.
Listen up. Oh, boxes can be shaped like a cube. What else can boxes be shaped like? Look at me, Joey. Okay, not at them. What else? What else can... what other shape can boxes be made into? Think of a cereal box. A rectangle? Rectangular prism. What else?
Hm? I forgot to get... Forgot to grab one for yourself? Where's the extra papers?
Okay, okay, and you gotta write your three, too. Okay, so now look. This is what... these are the four numbers you've got in this turn. Which one is correct? Who got that point? Who got that point?
Um, one and sixty-three hundredths is more than... Greater than one... Yeah, so what you're gonna do... And now you'll roll the next four numbers, boom, boom, boom, boom. Okay, don't forget if yours was incorrect, you've got to fix it on your paper so you don't take home the wrong information. Yes, ma'am?
Go ahead and write this all the way down your paper as well.
Why was hers correct?
Alright, another fun partner game, and let me show you how it works today. You are going to have a recording sheet, and you're going to have... some more opportunities to, um, compare numbers. And to use your great-than, less-than, and equal-to symbols, kay? Goodness, we've already been in class about thirty minutes. Alright. What we're gonna do is I'm gonna pass this around. This is your recording sheet. Have we picked your partners yet? No. No, not... we have not picked partners yet.
Yes.
Okay, we didn't see that, so just make that number a two.
Um, the way I know three point seven is greater than three point six five is because if you added zero to seven, seventy is greater than sixty five. Yes, that's correct. Who else has one? Audrey? Three point seven is farther on the number line, so it is larger. It's farther on the number line. If we were doing the number line task like we did at the beginning of class, it would be down a tad, wouldn't it? Jasmine.
Do we know what that means yet? Valentine's Day. It's a smile and a heart. Maybe it's part of the pattern. It is. It's gonna be related to the pattern, but we haven't seen enough yet. Joey, what did you tell your par... your partner about a cube?
What does the next one say? Watch. Now listen, though, shh. If... did you guys win that point or did I? You! Okay, but listen. I do want you to write it the correct way. 'Cause practicing things incorrectly will help nobody. So I want you to... And if you take your paper home and your mom's like, "Did your teacher tell you that was right?" It'd be difficult to explain. So I want you, somewhere on your paper, to write it the correct way.
Oh, y'all did a championship round?
Okay. I got three. She got three. Are we gonna do, um... the highest number wins or the lowest number wins, by the way? Who gets to go first? I don't know, highest number? Okay, that works. Alright. I got a six. I'm gonna go first. Just simply because I gotta teach you the game anyway, right? Yes, ma'am. So... This is what... Huh? Did you cheat? Watch. Alright, let's listen.
Oh, and by the way, Y'all should have been... you guys should have been putting in those numbers, too. Do that.
By ones, yes. We have it kind of going by ones. Alright, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at a decimal number. And think about where it would go on three different number lines. So looking at the first number line, I want you to draw... you could just draw a segment. But I want you to show me, where do you think you would put this number? Between which two numbers... on my number line. First of all...
Okay. Can you show me the percent? What would the percent be? What would the percent be?
You do your six; maybe those boys can help you count. And I think I'm gonna let Laura do this spinner, okay? Alright, so watch. Watch whoever's closest to you. Watch whoever's closest to you. You need... you want to borrow Charlie's pencil? Here you g... Oh, goodness, I almost got you. You guys remember how to make tallies? One, two, three, four, and then you strike across.
I've colored a full ten. Colored another ten. Show me a couple different ways to represent this number. What about using a decimal point? Good. Here's one way. Who has a different way? Colby] has two ways. We've got one... and ten hundredths. We also have one point one, which is one and one tenth. I see some fractions, good job.
Alright, and what I want to show you is for friends who might need... who may not... If it's really close and you're not sure, what you could do is you could also draw a picture to match it. If you need to have that picture. So, on your whiteboard... Listen to what I'm sayin'. Put your hand down for just a moment. On your whiteboard, I want you to draw a picture of that number sentence. Use your flats, your longs, and your units. What would that look like? Here, I'll draw it on here.
Okay. Who won that point?
That'd be hilarious. But I didn't. The eraser dropped onto the ground. Oh, we'll be okay. Okay, you ready? What we're gonna do is we're gonna go first. We're gonna go left to right. My paper all has less thans. You guys all have greater thans. Now, it really doesn't matter who rolls the dice first, just whoever you star with you need to stick with. I'm gonna roll the dice first.
Boys and girls, some of you guys are finishing a little bit quickly. If you want to do a couple more rounds, that is fine. We do need to be wrapping it up in the next five minutes. You have a math notebook prompt on the board. So you need to go to your next available page. What's wrong, bud?
Okay, I won't do that. Yes. Three point seventy-three. If I wanted to round this to the nearest whole number... Remember, your whole number is the number to the left of the decimal. ...show me what you would have. We're just gonna do a couple more things with this number. The closest whole number?
Yes. Who's your partner? Fatima. Fatima is? Okay. Alright, boys and girls, as you come to a stopping point... Hey, y'all. Boys and girls. Eyes on me please. Boys. Friends on the floor. Aria. Which number is larger? This is your prompt on the board.
It's a five. Alright, so I want you to show me... where would this number fall on this number line? Between which two numbers? Because now you're not just looking at the whole number. You're having to look at parts of the decimal as well. So show me what two numbers it would come in between.
Nice. With safety scissors yes; that would be impressive.
Okay, hold on, you got to erase it all the way across.
Okay, so that's it. So a hundred and nine didn't get anything. One hundred and ten had two factors. Alright, was anybody... I think we had a few friends who were able to reduce and tell us what the fraction would bein lowest terms. Look around, show your elbow partner what your answer was. I see a lot of equivalent fractions. What'd you guys get? I... I... I... I...
Yellow will mostly likely get, um, the most tallies. Okay. Yellow... Let me put this back up here so that you can see. Nobody should be writing anything at this point. If I see you with your whiteboard, I'll think that you're not with me. Okay, so put it a place where you can see. Charlie, we're gonna wait for you. So that you can look up here. Luke said that yellow most likely will win or have the most. Tallies. Okay?
Tell me what you got, kiddo. Four yellows, one red, one blue. Four yellows? Okay, let's look at what he got. Four yellows. One, two, three, four. Let me get someone else to help me. Jasmine, you're gonna help me tally. What else was it? One... One red. ...red and one blue. Okay. Um, Laura's spinner. What was yours? Three yellows. Okay, so you're gonna go strike across.
Put my dice away. Luke, why don't you walk around and be the helper, okay? Today is the second. It's February second.
Eunice, when's your birthday? Monday fourth is... Saturday, right? Okay, so we will sing tomorrow. Um, but let's take a look at a couple of the pictures we have for this month. You're gonna like these. There's a couple different patterns going on. Let me show you the one for the first. We're gonna do it for yesterday and for today.
No. No? Octagon?
Nine dice?
Alright, now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to erase this guy. For just a minute. And I'm going to erase these numbers 'cause we're gonna use this... Look at the second number line. We'll call it number line two. What's different about the first one that we just looked at, David? Um, it was going by ones, and this one is going by point fives. Okay, so this one's kind of going by halves.
Watch me. We've done this before.
No, no, he's still rolling that whole point.
It would round to four. And I was telling my, um, my science class that I won't be here on Monday because of jury duty. But this is the skill that you will be working on with whoever my substitute is. You'll be thinking about rounding. So I think it's kind of appropriate that we maybe talk a little bit about it today. I know we've already kind of covered that a little bit. But three point seventy-three is closer to four. Do you see that in my number line? Which is just an example of a type of graphic organizer, isn't it?
So this is more of a luck game. Knew it; I told you. Okay? Alright. Now, roll the other two. Okay. Class. Six. Yes! Don't say yes yet. I got a four. And a four. Okay, this is how this games works. Is that number sentence true? Yes. Read it for me.
Who were you working with? Okay. Joey's working with... David and Brandon are gonna work together. Garett, y'all need to get started, okay?
Okay. And a... But I see a four, so where'd you get three from?
If you need to draw a picture, if you weren't sure. Do you have to do that? No. No. I would not draw elaborate pictures. Draw your... whole numbers... your tenths... and your hundredths. Okay? We've been using these blocks all throughout our decimals unit. And on the calendar. This is the picture that matches. If you don't need that, do you have to do that? No. No.
Yeah, we don't really have enough pictures to see. What could you predict is going to be kind of the theme or what we do for the rest of the month. Audrey? Um, each heart could be an odd number. But tell me what you think the picture's gonna be. Three-dimensional. Three dimensional shapes or solids. Alright, the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna play a game. I know you guys were disappointed that... number crunch went away for a little bit. We're gonna play a probability game. The name of this game is going to be one hundred and twenty spins.
If we add an ounce a day, about how many ounces will we have tomorrow? We'll have about three. We'll have three ounces tomorrow, okay. So we'll talk a little bit about that. Um, can I have my spinners, please? And when you back to your seats, you're gonna hold on to your whiteboards. Hold on to your whiteboards for just a minute. I'm gonna see if you can kind of help me out on the number line. Um... And then we'll put them away when we go to our partner game, okay? As you go back, I need you to try not to bump the camera. So you might want to go around that way.
Three... Wait, no, no, never mind.
The first thing you're going to do is write a fraction showing how many days we've been in school so far. And we're gonna spend just about ten minutes doing calendar. We may not get to everything. Show me the fraction that tells us how many days we've been in school so far. Well, that's just exciting, huh? But no snow days yet. Can you reduce that?
I'm always number thirteen; I'm sorry, it's superstitious, but I'm always number thirteen. Question: can you kind of make predictions about who's gonna get the point after the first couple of numbers rolled? Yeah, 'cause you know the likelihood. Um, of getting ones that would either be less than or greater than. You want a turn, baby? Or you have a question? I guess I want a turn. Okay, you know what, though, I think I get to go fir... I think, actually, it was my turn, and then I'll to you, kay? Alright. Real easy to set up, too.
Three point seven or three point sixty five? Three point... Explain your thinking using pictures, numbers and words. You're gonna do a quick write. We are going to share these in about... eight minutes. So a quick write means you're sitting down, you're getting it done. You may take this game home. Hurry. Put my clipboards away, please.
Alright. No? Will you... oh, my goodness, my helpers. You did not think to make things more efficient necessarily. I make it more... Okay. Does everybody have a recording sheet for this game? Yes. Okay, good deal. Alright, listen up for just a moment. Um, the first thing you're gonna do is you are going to roll the dice, you and your partner.
M'kay. Roll the next two numbers. You roll it all the way across. It's still your turn.
Yes, yes, okay.
Did you do an equation? Tell me what's your equat... You did an equation with pictures? I did... Okay. I did... Take one minute and share to the person to the right or to the left or across from you, but turn to your elbow partner, let them see your math thinking... Make sure you have your homework packed up. Tomorrow... Listen, guys, for just a second. Daily grade on this skill tomorrow 'cause I think we're good with it. Kay?
Still shouldn't see people playing on their whiteboards. Want to help me pass it out, buddy?
Keep going. You're gonna roll the next two. Y'all are gonna have the same numbers going across. It's just only one of them will be an accurate number sentence. The other one will not be. Write a two.
Hundredths. Yeah, did you hear what Josh said? He says he kn... he knew it was gonna be bigger than three point seven. So he knew it was going to be a number bigger than this. And I knew it was gonna be less than three point eight. And he knew it was gonna be less than this. So that kind of narrowed it, where that would fall in. What did he have to look at? Did you hear what he said? He said in this case, he had to look at the hundredths place. If I wanted to round three point seventy-three... Boy, we could just play with this number all day, couldn't we? Uh-huh.
What would Laura have to roll next?
Two point twenty-four is going to be greater than... something. That's gonna be tricky. Who do you think is more than likely going to get this point? Based on the first two numbers.
Okay, next it's one. Alright.
How many days until the end of the school year?
Tell me what this picture is. This is the one for today. Gary, your eyes should be up here. This is a rectangular prism. Tell me... tell me how it's different. Well, first of all, how are they the same. How are rectangular prisms and cubes the same? Tell me one way. I like how Matthew has his hand raised. Quadrilateral? Huh? Quadrilateral? Well, they're not quadrilaterals, but they're... Faces maybe. Because remember they're three dimensional. So, how many faces are there?
Oh, the thirty and thirty-one from January, I still have up there. Alright, who's our next birthday?
Boys, boys. The first step is you have to roll the dice and decide who writes the less-than symbol all the way down their paper, and then that doesn't change. And who writes the greater than down their paper, and that doesn't change. M'kay, do that first. Figure out who's, uh, uh, less than and greater than.
Put your... put your hand down; you should be drawing on your whiteboard right now. Oh, on the whiteboard. Um, we're supposed to draw the third one? What I'm demonstrating right now is I'm showing how if you needed more support and if you weren't sure, especially if you had something like one point two zero and one point zero two... I don't get this at all. I do.
Okay.
Three and seven tenths is larger than three and sixty-five hundredths. I know this because ten times ten is one hundred, so seven times ten is seventy and seventy is greater than sixty-five. Okay. Josh? I think three... three point seven is bigger becau... because it's the same thing as three... three point seventy. Okay.
Yeah, good, I like your pictures, too. Oh, you even got arrows. Yeah. Very nice. Friends, we're also gonna try to work on our bridges tomorrow, kay? After we do our daily grade, full bridge-building day. So you might want take a look at the rules again. It's time for us to start testing the... trucks to see if they can fit across. How is it a truck? I... I don't see anything. This has to be able to go across your... road bed.
Want to help me pass these out, sweetie? Quick write. I already see Eunice, she has her math notebook out. Which number is larger, three point seven or three point sixty-five? Explain your thinking using pictures, numbers, and words. And also symbols.
That's why my last number is a what?
