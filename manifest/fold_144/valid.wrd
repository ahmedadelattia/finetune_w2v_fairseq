okay good stay there you can bring your paper with you if you are afraid you are going to forget what it looks like
okay so you are showing me so you are showing me on this paper here you are saying that this one has equal sides right yeah okay but here is my question does this one have equal sides no but they are telling us this is a polygon so this might have equal sides but it does not seem like you have to have equal sides does it no
okay now the reason are you guys done isaiah and justin have you finished no okay hurry up and finish you got 30 more seconds or actually bring it back to your seats where you were that is fine you can finish it after i want to talk about the next step so i confused some of you
you shush too i am going to pick 5 prize winners today and they are going to get to pick from the prize box and the 1st person i pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box so it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can all right 20 seconds right as many yes as many tickets raise your hand when you have something to say yes jamari did not i get picked out yes you can pick later for that too did i get picked out
okay now i will wait
what do you need
can i do this one too nope because that already tells you they already tell you there that is your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon isaiah and justin together please miguel and thomas together please marvin and isaiah together please you know what we work with partners as we are assigned in this class and you get rewarded when you work with no he is not you are not going to start trouble are you what am i doing you are working with marvin
we will see you are going to write with a pencil go ahead draw me one that is either a polygon or not a polygon move your desk over a little bit please a bit more than that he will get a chance everybody is going to get a chance
no it does not matter but does look it like it ms jensen we do not know what polygons are yes right and we have not done the definition so that is okay if you do not get it correct but i want you to look and see if you can think of something that these shapes here have in common that these shapes do not have and then find the ones that have the same things in common on your sheet okay these 2
not a polygon please yeah it belongs in there please
no he messed up he did something wrong he has got the extra okay well copy it right off the paper he has the paper in front of him he can fix it that looks like a state or something on the map it looks nothing like mpas where does it come out
yeah i do okay maybe the battery maybe it is the plug up up there hold on a 2nd yes can we pause this
i know ms jensen maybe the plug is not working the kind of plug oh you know what oh wait the thing is not on xavier you get 10000 points that might be the problem that is not what
let us take a look at what we put up here is this a polygon yes yep consensus is this a polygon yes yes is this a polygon yes is this a polygon yes no no that is curved thank you it is curved they are not line segments right wait so no no we already did that one over there right no what about this
i want to go back to our 3 attributes that we came up with so far closed line segments and vertices does it have corners where it meets yes okay so it has that does it have line segments yes is it a closed figure not really no no in order to be closed well .
now yes all right go put it up quick the the marker is already up there does anybody have a question i do about someone is up there thatt hey think ah i do not agree i do not agree i either think this is a polygon or i think it is not a polygon i think they got it mixed up
yes let me let me take that back because we missed and this is my bad we missed part of line segments the thing about polygons my fault is that the thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices but they do not cross they never cross
what they have to be together they have to be together so richard is saying they have to be together sure what do you mean by together okay so what richard is saying is that this is not together okay
you can do the next one richard thank you for your enthusiasm you know what enthusiasm means no your excitement all right so richard draw us a polygon or not a polygon i am not even doing nothing do you know what you are yes i know josea you have had how many good days in a row like the whole week almost right
okay now a closed shape all the line segments and it is hard sometimes with this of course it is not going to even look like that but it is difficult sometimes with the pen but miguel i can take care of it myself thank you
now did you hear what i said before you came back in did you hear what i said hey do you know what you are doing what is the matter what is the matter can you work with thomas at least or you do not want to work with thomas ms jensen could i take a 5 minutes break what is going on in here today
if you say nah that is not a polygon that is not a polygon then you could come up i am not saying it is wrong okay but you could come up and you could put a question mark inside okay and that can be your turn
x c a star this is not one 2 so do we cross it out nope you write p if it is a polygon you write n if it is not a polygon all right n well did you talk to your partner did you decide what makes a polygon and what does not yeah all right if it is a polygon are you guys talking to each other what makes a polygon what does not make a polygon
hey he did not do that because he saw the plug unplugged all right everybody stand up mommy everybody stand up ms jensen he is talking about my mom jumping jacks 15 of them let us go ms jensen he is talking about my mom i will take care of it
exactly no well well that is what i am saying this is not how we normally act during math so let us try to make it normal pretend it is not even here okay okay now we are going to talk about no okay all the talking guys come on it is a camera it is not
so you are saying that they are regular shapes okay all right well are not these regular shapes here too though yeah okay anybody have anything else that when they 1st look at these they think hey i know what these polygons might have in common i know one what is that richard
so the 1st thing i want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons what might be the same about them i am not going to ask you to share it yet i do not want you to share it yet but i want you to think about it because i am going to give you another sheet in a minute and you are going to work with a partner next to you
so what i want you to do while i get this fixed is i want you to look and try to figure out do not say it out loud think in your head what is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons in your head only that is not a polygon no in your head only i am not going to answer that question right now guys circle it that is not a polygon no i am right now i can not spell right now
hold on do you have more that go up there or do you have a question about one all right the way we are going to start xavier huh we are we are discussing if the right but right now i need you up here please okay thank you
and i am abbreviating okay we know it means that they all have line segments as their sides that those line segments meet i got one in the corners which are vertices and that it is a closed shape hold on no hold on i want to show you something with this okay tell me let us look at this is this a closed figure no no because we have what
okay what number is that you forgot to write the number you are not showing no no no because all right let us take a look at
that is not a polygon i got one right yeah no i do not know which one have not you done one already let us let everyone have a chance 1st do you have one that is not a polygon ms jensen hold on does anybody else wants wants a turn that has not had a turn i do i do i do i do you just did one right nathan you want a turn do you have one that is not a polygon
i think a polygon is fully shaped fully shaped okay this is not a polygon okay well talk to your partners about that tell them i do not want you to just write something down i want you to talk about it
do not worry okay is that big yeah that is a perfect size i do not think i read it right now the one thing i am going to ask is make sure because i know the figure that he is drawing is like this right it comes down all the way let us make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that
with nathan too yeah that every one of them is the same he is not even done how could it be the same you guys need to talk to him ms jensen i am done ms jensen i am done all right hold on to it hold on to it we are going to do a little activity with this in a 2nd
in math when we are talking about characteristics we are talking about attributes if i was talking about jamari one of the characteristics i could use to describe him is that he is kind and he is gentle all right he is a good friend those are characteristics that would describe jamari right what we are doing now is we are coming up with characteristics that describe polygons okay
make sure you and xavier have the same answers and i am going to tell you in a minute no worries if it is polygon you put the one
now an open shape could look something like this right do we see the difference this part of it is left open this it is all closed all the line segments meet each other okay so we could say that polygons richard is theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes richard
now what do you want to tell me okay you can tell me in a 2nd then because i am going to give this marker out for a 2nd and i am going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that is on your paper and put it in the right circle so for example you could choose number one and if you think it is a polygon draw it in the polygon circle if you think it is not a polygon draw it in the not a polygon circle
all right justin put the number up there too okay so you are saying that is a polygon okay what number is it
no okay is it closed yes does it have straight lines that do not cross does it have straight lines that do not cross yeah does the do they meet at vertices do they all meet at corners yeah is it a polygon no yeah is it a polygon no why not tell me why not prove it that it is not it is because i look kind of crooked it no these are in order you are getting confused
is this a line segment no yeah no a line segment is straight okay a line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this this is what this is if it is not straight it is circle not a circle oval it is not an oval but what is the what is the .
you were right jamari that is well i should not put a correct mark because this is a polygon okay so you were right to question it how about this one number 10 here isaiah you put this one up right not a polygon tell me you think it is not a polygon tell me why you think it is not a polygon isaiah because it does not have the the even sides it is curved yeah it is curved okay so you were right on this how about this here
jamari to do okay something else to learn maybe to to learn okay answer no and you need to not call out what does det lala determine mean to know the word of what it is to figure it out right
only because i am having major technical difficulties with my board and so the kids are all silly anyway we could turn it back on in a 2nd i just okay let us fix so someone let us start and somebody read our content objective again me again students can students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon polygon or not a polygon
are they open or closed closed closed i do not know why that is coming out red but so you know what not the time to talk about field trip right now and crayons go away no it is not time to color we are looking for characteristics of polygons
that is all right uhh while he is doing that does anyone have a polygon they would like to put up i would josea you had a chance right but everybody is going to get a chance 1st what is that a diamond no or here turn this over it is a square i need you looking at this
the line here is not straight so it is not a line segment it is curved right so we do not have line segments there so we know this is not a polygon what about this it is crooked it is crooked it is crooked it is not that it is crooked because this is a straight line one side is bigger than the other this is a straight line one is bigger than the other okay let us go back to let us go okay no hold on
i know and that is my bad guys that is my bad ignore what is up here okay i was getting ready for our next step xavier your seat is over here please be in it xavier not in 5 minutes right now but they are doing them wrong xavier listen to me
students will be able to define a polygon okay so not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or is not a polygon but before you can do that you have to know what a polygon is right i have heard of it before you have heard of it before anybody else heard of it before nope no okay well we are going to talk about them today the paper in front of you and up here has 3 shapes that they are telling us are polygons okay and the bottom 5 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
whereas this is together all of the line segments meet okay now richard when we talk about that in math when we talk about a shape like this that does not meet and a shape like this that does meet we are talking about a closed shape or an open shape
because i want to know that you knew and you will get extra points for that you know where they are you can write it down now what we are going to start with is i want you to see is that our homework ms jensen this is not your homework is not that homework okay i know this is listen listen
anyone know the math term for when 2 line segments meet like that to form an angle what we call it right angle vertical they are called vertices okay where 2 line segments meet and make angle are called vertices okay running out of room
uhh no do you have one that is a polygon okay can i do it yeah thank you
polygons they are shapes it is the corner i did not ask about the corners i want you to look at the paper looking at the paper okay the top 3 shapes they are telling us that those are polygons okay and the bottom 3 shapes they are telling us are not polygons
number 8 we are discussing the paper what number is that we are discussing it okay okay this one i got one hold on do you have one that is not a polygon i do
there that is what i want thank you no so boring you know what okay sorry sorry you are not going to be famous okay all right until i get this on let us take a look at the paper in front of you we have polygons
okay umm look at me marvin work with isaiah please okay you know what isaiah can you bring your seat over here and work with no you are working by yourself if you do not work with him let us go isaiah bring a chair over here thomas and miguel isaiah is going to work with you too okay
so take a look at these again and notice what they have in common those top 3 notice what they have in common not going to take comments i want to see how you guys do working this out on your own with your partner and and the bottom ones you are going to figure out why are they not polygons what is different from the ones on top okay
what number was yours josea mine yep what do you mean number look at your sheet what number is it 9 what number is yours jamari mine is one we will put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape what number was yours what number was this it was 2 no that one is 2 that one is 2 okay
do not worry about it okay now everybody look at the camera make a funny face stay right here we are in your seat okay now sit down okay okay come on now sit down now we need to forget that it is even there
let us look at not all but some yeah okay so if we are not saying all and we are saying some do you think it has to mean are any of the lines do the shape are like even like this this is a polygon right this has the same height of this and then this .
go put a question mark jamari in one that you think 3 of them okay go put the question marks in them put that away now why because it is not time to draw it is time to do math yes it is
yeah yeah the sooner we get math done the sooner we get through everything else the more chance that free time starts at 2.35
please do not crinkle that all right let us take a look up here i know there is some that we have not gotten up there but i want to see if we can come up with some rules that we think makes a polygon a polygon or makes a polygon or makes something not a polygon i am going to wait till everyone is sitting though and ready ms jensen you need to sit down okay
no no no no no no no no okay i am sorry ignore what is up here so far this has nothing to do with whether it is a polygon or not
so jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon thank you okay so jamari says this is a polygon okay if you disagree with him when it is your turn you can put a question mark inside his polygon
i confused some of you and rightfully so because what i did was i drew 2 circles on the board and i put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other but what this means is we are going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet and the ones that are a polygon we are going to put inside this circle and the ones that are not a polygon we are going to put inside that circle so i am not telling you this is a polygon this is not a polygon so that is why you were confused
i said i am saying hello okay and of course we have technical difficulties what if we press that button i do not know which way is it on jamari when it has the orange or when it does not when it has the green when it has the green on that little circle thing okay when there is like a light coming right here yeah okay sit sit sit sit it is red okay so let us wait and see if it comes on or not
no thomas and jamari okay so let us get started so that we can get to work on all right somebody want to read our objective for today i do josea what is our objective for today students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly polygon okay stop there students will be able to determine what does determine mean again someone raise their hand raise their hand what does determine mean again
you know what it is not your business to tell them that they are wrong sit down josea you 2 need to stay in your seats all right eyes up here eyes up here did some of us i will wait no point of arguing
okay freeze it is coming on okay hit the 1st 2 lights please no it is not yes it is how do you know okay you guys are right again wait a 2nd yeah just 2 just half no the other half no no no flip them
that way we are all talking about the same shape okay isaiah would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon in your opinion or one that is not a polygon not okay go ahead not is over here do i have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon i know hand up only
then we will be able to do it now so do you see how all 4 sides meet yeah that makes it a closed figure so a polygon is a closed figure can you give me something else that is an attribute you think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons miguel male the sides have to meet the sides have to meet miguel says
so i am going to have richard nathan and jamari work together as a trio i will take care of you in a 2nd xavier xavier you are going to work with josea and what you are going to do is if you think this shape is a polygon you are going to write a p on it if you think this shape is not a polygon you are going to write an n on it for not okay so you are determining if it is a polygon or not
in order for a line to be straight it does not mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way it can be any way it just can not be curved okay so xavier is this closed yes is are they line segments that do not cross yes are they do they have vertices yeah is it a polygon yes yes let us go to let us go to not a polygon
that they are line segments that meet at those corners
i know what a polygon looks like this is one minute off of free time shut up shut up man i i understand that it is different having a video camera in here but it is staring right at me you know what miguel then move your seat
it is not closed it is not closed what is the problem here it is 2 shapes right it is not one shape right now is this shape if we took this triangle away is that a polygon if we took this square away is that a polygon yes but put them together they are not polygons right okay great job great job let us go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see
what this big line segment here right that is extending out from this vertice okay so we know this is not a polygon what is wrong with this now this is closed it has a line segment this vertice but not really right because what cut in half but not really because what are these line segments no
it this a square or is it not no we will talk about it we will talk about it we will talk about it we are not going to argue over what a shape is or is not right now that is perfect and they are not going to look exactly like they look in the picture what you can do umm where is that marker please wait why did you give him the marker
no is it the 11th that is you today is 11th do not worry about putting the date on i just want you to look at this for a 2nd oh this did not get turned on please do not whistle so sorry but there is a camera okay and again camera should not make any difference done
isaiah bring your desk next to thomas mister gomez could you work with thomas and isaiah please
okay and that the sides are line segments okay that is a good list that is a very good list can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that 1st page here sorry have that in common can we agree that they have corners yes vertices
fit that s in here you know miguel i am glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes lie oh no i am telling you the truth now now you have to walk all the way over there that is okay that is okay i can handle it now so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure the sides meet at corners
okay that is a polygon i am asking you it is not there no it does not that is just that is cool right it says polygon and then it says not a polygon i am sorry if i confused you it means we are going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that are not that is so easy that is my name right here okay to your seat i do not get it they are the same thing
do you have our spray right up there okay so these polygons here umm what was the question repeat repeat what you said nathan oh they all have points okay what do we call this when we are talking about math what do the corners corners okay we are getting some great math vocabulary words here
to decide to figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon right anyone know what a polygon is do you know hold on to it though do not tell us yet do you know all right write it down on piece of paper for me
that is right this is not a polygon right it is not a polygon what is wrong with this one that has crooked like the lines okay take crooked take crooked out of your vocabulary right there is no corner here right so this is right you were right it is not a polygon okay number 12 that is not a polygon i want to take a look at that i did number 12 okay you did number 12
i will wait no one is even talking you know what guys i will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether if somebody is talking and is not supposed to i will take care of that
so we can say about polygons that they have sides right that are made of what line segments all the polygons have lines right which are straight okay that makes a line right
sides corners does anyone know and i used this word before this might be a new one for you what it is called when we have a straight line the part of a straight line what we call that line segment line segment all right
wait and that they are all closed figures yes all right let us look at our not jamari is very excited that he was right now let us hold on now not polygons let us think of our list all right closed figure
do you want to really blow it now no no so make some good choices for me okay yes yes can i go next possibly hold on all right so richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite right it is open and it has a line that goes further down he says that is not a polygon all right isaiah
okay so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon okay and we just said that we that determine means to figure out or decide so we are going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or is not a polygon okay now someone read the language objective xavier students oh wait students will be able to define a polygon
i appreciate that you are talking about math but right now we are going to have a whole group discussion about math okay well isaiah is finishing up up there i want your 1st thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not i want your 1st thoughts about polygons okay
why is it not a polygon because it it is not even what do you mean it is not even one of the sides is shorter than the other side did we say that the sides have to be equal over here no we have we said that the sides have to be line segments that do not cross are there any line segments that cross in that yeah where no no no no is it a closed figure or an open figure i was right on that one too closed yes you were
okay ms jensen okay saying that excuse me wait no i am talking to miguel right now saying sides meet at corners miguel is different from lines of symmetry okay saying that sides meet at corners here we have sides meeting at corners right here we have sides meeting at corners one corner 2345 corners right
they are always open open figure they are always open no no corners no corners meet okay so let us look at this if we have as our 3 characteristics i am going to write inside of this okay because this is polygons we have closed line segments vertices and vertices
is there something that you notice about those 1st 3 polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have excuse me yes that the ones the 31s on the top are like regular shapes like square a star
thomas you asked for another pencil right no you did not you asked for a break you did not ask for a pencil you asked for a break right no i did not hear you thomas so n if it is not a polygon p if it is now do we agree yeah
so that is something that some polygons might have but we are looking for things that all polygons are going to have okay good thinking though nathan uhh pointy they all have points okay so you are saying it begins with an a no problem you are saying she has been up for a minute because rocky needed the bathroom but she wants me to brush her hair
the one thing i am going to say is let us draw them about this size so that we have enough room okay all right we do not want them real giant because we need enough room we want them big enough so everyone can see them you can tell me in 12nd so miguel not right this 2nd who would like to put a polygon or not a polygon up there yes is this it or this not i want to you had a chance
can i switch with somebody then
so they all have line segments so sides are line segments now let us get back to what nathan said he said that they have corners okay we said that the sides meet at corners right so we know that they have sides that are line segments that they meet at the corners okay
okay so they never cross that is the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon okay those line segments never cross so what is the problem with this one it crosses it crosses that is the problem with this one is that it crosses okay so that is not a polygon what is the problem with the 4th one down there on the bottom
is this not a polygon yeah correct how about this one why is it not a polygon it is a polygon because it has straight lines it has straight lines what else and it has line segments okay it has line segments that do not cross it has corners and it is closed this is a polygon so who put the question mark up here jamari jamari did you
okay but that is different from lines of symmetry on 1st look there would not be any lines of symmetry to this figure okay so that is okay it is good thinking and this is actually you are on the right track here okay but i do not want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it does not really have to do with that okay yes sides meet at corners okay the lines are even so all the lines are even
no does not have to be green close to never mind
another word for characteristics is attributes so what attributes do polygons have okay how would we describe polygons i could describe jamari as tall kind gentle right how would i describe a polygon one way we are thinking to describe a polygon is that it is a closed wait a 2nd 12nd that it is closed okay that it is a closed figure okay
you might by that time free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45 no no that that is good that means you get extra free time oh see it means you get extra free time that is a good thing all right shhh is it looking at you right now okay yes the camera is on we are going to try to pretend it is not here please counting down from 5 4 3 2 you shush
and we know that that means all the the sides are even okay this needs to be recalibrated but closed i did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot i did not give up i am just going to recalibrate it after math is over
to try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons okay so do you understand what i said richard yeah repeat what i said for me please repeat what i said you are going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons okay and you are going to work with a partner to do so
why there you go can i just face go now again guys this is a video camera no big deal okay pretend it is not here let us have our normal math lesson okay and ms you know what is funny what we usually do not act like that since when we are doing math when the camera is not here
what do you mean by that everything meets like in the corner ms jensen sides meet at corners ms jensen
is it a closed figure or an open figure closed do they meet at corners do the line segments meet at corners is this a polygon yes this is a polygon you know what it is okay when we were i want you to remember that when we were doing this we did not even know the definition of a polygon okay we did not even know so let me ask you a question let us go
well there you go so those would be polygons ms jensen yes i got my name so small okay that is fine
why you know the rules richard
and it is good to be confused it means you were paying attention okay means you were paying attention no it does not yes it does i will wait 3 2 before it comes up 3 times one xavier xavier yeah please put that down
