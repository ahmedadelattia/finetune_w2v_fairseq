Okay, good, stay there. You can bring your paper with you if you're afraid you're going to forget what it looks like.
Okay, so you're showing me, so you're showing me on this paper here, you're saying that this one has equal sides, right? Yeah. Okay, but here's my question. Does this one have equal sides? No. But they're telling us this is a polygon. So this might have equal sides, but it doesn't seem like you have to have equal sides, does it? No.
Okay. Now, the reason. Are you guys done? Isaiah and Justin? Have you finished? No? Okay, hurry up and finish, you got 30 more seconds. Or actually bring it back to your seats where you were, that's fine. You can finish it after. I want to talk about the next step. So I confused some of you.
You shush too. I'm going to pick five prize winners today, and they're going to get to pick from the prize box. And the first person I pull is going to get to pick from the large prize box. So it is in your best interest to earn as many points as you can. All right? 20 seconds, right? As many, yes. As many tickets. Raise your hand when you have something to say. Yes, Jamari? Didn't I get picked out? Yes, you can pick later for that, too. Did I get picked out?
Okay? Now I'll wait.
What do you need?
Can I do this one too? Nope, because that already tells you. They already tell you there, that's your information to use to try to figure out what makes a polygon a polygon. Isaiah and Justin together please. Miguel and Thomas together, please. Marvin and Isaiah together please. You know what? We work with partners as we're assigned in this class, and you get rewarded when you work with. No, he's not. You're not going to start trouble, are you? What am I doing? You're working with Marvin.
We'll see. You're going to write with a pencil? Go ahead, draw me one that is either a polygon or not a polygon. Move your desk over a little bit, please. A bit more than that. He'll get a chance. Everybody's going to get a chance.
No, it doesn't matter, but does look it like it? Ms. Jensen, we don't know what polygons are. Yes. Right. And we haven't done the definition, so that's okay if you don't get it correct, but I want you to look and see if you can think of something that these shapes here have in common... That these shapes don't have. And then find the ones that have the same things in common on your sheet, okay? These two.
Not a polygon, please. Yeah, it belongs in there, please.
No, he messed up, he did something wrong. He's got the extra. Okay, well, copy it right off the paper. He has the paper in front of him, he can fix it. That looks like a state or something on the map. It looks nothing like mpas. Where does it come out?
Yeah, I do. Okay. Maybe the battery. Maybe it's the plug up up there. Hold on a second. Yes. Can we, um, pause this?
I know, Ms. Jensen. Maybe the plug is not working. The kind of plug. Oh, you know what? Oh, wait, the thing is not on. Xavier, you get 10,000 points. That might be the problem. That's not. What?
Let's take a look at what we put up here. Is this a polygon? Yes. Yep. Consensus. Is this a polygon? Yes. Yes. Is this a polygon? Yes. Is this a polygon? Yes. No. No. That's curved. Thank you. It's curved. They are not line segments, right? Wait. So. No. No, we already did that one over there, right? No. What about this?
I want to go back to our three attributes that we came up with so far. Closed, line segments and vertices. Does it have corners where it meets? Yes. Okay, so it has that. Does it have line segments? Yes. Is it a closed figure? Not really, no. No, in order to be closed... Well...
Now. Yes. All right, go put it up quick. The, the marker is already up there. Does anybody have a question? I do. About... Someone's up there thatt hey think, ah, I don't agree. I don't agree. I either think this is a polygon or I think it's not a polygon, I think they got it mixed up.
Yes, let me, let me take that back, because we missed, and this is my bad. We missed part of line segments. The thing about polygons, my fault, is that. The thing about the line segments is that they meet at the vertices, but they don't cross. They never cross.
What? They have to be together. They have to be together. So Richard is saying they have to be together. Sure. What do you mean by together? Okay. So what Richard's saying is that this is not together, okay?
You can do the next one, Richard. Thank you for your enthusiasm. You know what enthusiasm means? No. Your excitement. All right. So, Richard, draw us a polygon or not a polygon? I'm not even doing nothing. Do you know what you are? Yes, I know. Josea, you've had how many good days in a row? Like the whole week almost? Right.
Okay? Now, a closed shape, all the line segments, and it's hard sometimes with this. Of course, it's not going to even look like that, but... It's difficult sometimes with the pen but... Miguel, I can take care of it myself, thank you.
Now, did you hear what I said before you came back in? Did you hear what I said? Hey, do you know what you're doing? What's the matter? What's the matter? Can you work with Thomas at least? Or you don't want to work with Thomas? Ms. Jensen, could I take a 5 minutes break? What's going on in here today?
If you say, nah, that's not a polygon. That's not a polygon. Then you could come up. I'm not saying it's wrong. Okay? But you could come up and you could put a question mark inside. Okay? And that can be your turn.
X-C. A star, this is not. 1-2. So do we cross it out? Nope,you write P if it's a polygon. You write N if it's not a polygon. All right, N. Well, did you talk to your partner? Did you decide what makes a polygon and what doesn't? Yeah. All right, if it's a polygon... Are you guys talking to each other? What makes a polygon? What doesn't make a polygon?
Hey, he didn't do that because he saw the plug unplugged. All right, everybody stand up. Mommy. Everybody stand up. Ms. Jensen, he's talking about my mom. Jumping jacks, 15 of them, let's go. Ms. Jensen, he's talking about my mom. I'll take care of it.
Exactly. No. Well, well, that's what I'm saying. This is not how we normally act during math, so let's try to make it normal. Pretend it's not even here, okay? Okay. Now we're going to talk about. No. Okay, all the talking, guys, come on. It's a camera, it's not.
So you're saying that they're regular shapes, okay. All right. Well, aren't these regular shapes here too, though? Yeah, okay. Anybody have anything else that when they first look at these, they think, hey, I know what these polygons might have in common. I know one. What's that, Richard?
So the first thing I want you to do is to think about why those shapes on top might be polygons. What might be the same about them. I'm not going to ask you to share it yet. I don't want you to share it yet, but I want you to think about it. Because I'm going to give you another sheet in a minute, and you're going to work with... A partner next to you.
So what I want you to do while I get this fixed is I want you to look and try to figure out. Don't say it out loud, think in your head. What is different about the polygons and the ones that are not polygons? In your head only. That's not a polygon. No, in your head only. I'm not going to answer that question right now. Guys, circle it. That's not a polygon. No, I'm right now, I can't spell right now.
Hold on. Do you have more that go up there, or do you have a question about one? All right, the way we're going to start... Xavier. Huh? We're, we're discussing if the... Right, but right now I need you up here, please. Okay. Thank you.
And I'm abbreviating, okay? We know it means that they all have line segments as their sides, that those line segments meet I got one. In the corners, which are vertices, and that it's a closed shape. Hold on. No, hold on. I want to show you something with this, okay? Tell me. Let's look at this. Is this a closed figure? No. No, because we have what?
Okay. What number is that? You forgot to write the number. You're not showing. No, no, no, because. All right, let's take a look at.
That's not a polygon, I got one, right? Yeah. No, I don't know which one. Haven't you done one already? Let's let everyone have a chance first. Do you have one that's not a polygon? Ms. Jensen Hold on. Does anybody else wants, wants a turn that hasn't had a turn? I do, I do, I do, I do. You just did one. Right. Nathan, you want a turn? Do you have one that's not a polygon?
I think a polygon is fully shaped, fully shaped. Okay. This is not a polygon. Okay, well, talk to your partners about that, tell them. I don't want you to just write something down, I want you to talk about it.
Don't worry. Okay. Is that big? Yeah, that's a perfect size. I don't think I read it right. Now, the one thing I'm going to ask is make sure, because I know the figure that he's drawing is like this, right? It comes down all the way. Let's make sure that we draw him carefully enough that we can do that.
With Nathan, too? Yeah. That every one of them is the same? He's not even done, how could it be the same? You guys need to talk to him. Ms. Jensen, I'm done. Ms. Jensen, I'm done. All right, hold on to it. Hold on to it. We're going to do a little activity with this in a second.
In math, when we're talking about characteristics, we're talking about attributes. If I was talking about Jamari, one of the characteristics I could use to describe him is that he's kind and he's gentle. All right? He's a good friend. Those are characteristics that would describe Jamari, right? What we're doing now is we're coming up with characteristics that describe polygons, okay?
Make sure you and Xavier have the same answers. And I'm going to tell you in a minute, no worries. If it's polygon, you put the one.
Now, an open shape could look something like this, right? Do we see the difference? This part of it is left open, this it's all closed. All the line segments meet each other. Okay? So we could say... That polygons, Richard's theory is that polygons are what kind of shapes? Richard?
Now. What do you want to tell me? Okay, you can tell me in a second, then. Because I'm going to give this marker out for a second, and I'm going to ask someone to come and draw one of the polygons or not polygons that's on your paper and put it in the right circle. So, for example, you could choose number one, and if you think it's a polygon, draw it in the polygon circle. If you think it's not a polygon, draw it in the not a polygon circle.
All right, Justin. Put the number up there too, okay? So you're saying that is a polygon. Okay. What number is it?
No. Okay? Is it closed? Yes. Does it have straight lines that don't cross? Does it have straight lines that don't cross? Yeah. Does the, do they meet at vertices? Do they all meet at corners? Yeah. Is it a polygon? No. Yeah. Is it a polygon? No. Why not? Tell me why not. Prove it that it's not. It is. Because I look kind of crooked. It, no, these are. In order, you're getting confused.
Is this a line segment? No? Yeah? No, a line segment is straight, okay? A line segment is straight like this or like this or this or this. This is what? This is... If it's not straight, it's... Circle. Not a circle. Oval. It's not an oval. But what is the, what is the...
You were right, Jamari, that is. Well, I shouldn't put a correct mark because this is a polygon, okay? So you were right to question it. How about this one? Number ten here, Isaiah, you put this one up, right? Not a polygon. Tell me, you think it's not a polygon. Tell me why you think it's not a polygon, Isaiah. Because it doesn't have the, the even sides. It's curved. Yeah. It's curved, okay. So you were right on this. How about this here?
Jamari? To do, okay. Something else? To learn, maybe, to... To learn, okay. Answer. No, and you need to not call out. What does det, lala, determine mean? To know the word of what it is? To figure it out, right?
Only because I'm having major technical difficulties with my board. And... So the kids are all silly anyway. Uh, we could turn it back on in a second, I just... Okay, let's fix. So someone let's start, and somebody read our content objective again. Me. Again? Students can, students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon, polygon or not a polygon.
Are they open or closed? Closed. Closed. I don't know why that's coming out red, but... So you know what? Not the time to talk about field trip right now and crayons go away. No, it's not time to color. We're looking for characteristics of polygons.
That's all right. Uhh, while he's doing that, does anyone have a polygon they'd like to put up? I would. Josea You had a chance. Right. But everybody's going to get a chance first. What is that? A diamond. No. Or here. Turn this over. It's a square. I need you looking at this.
The line here is not straight, so it's not a line segment, it's curved, right? So we don't have line segments there. So we know this is not a polygon. What about this? It's crooked, it's crooked. It's crooked. It's not that it's crooked because this is a straight line. One side is bigger than the other. This is a straight line. One's bigger than the other. Okay. Let's go back to, let's go. Okay. No, hold on.
I know, and that's my bad. Guys, that's my bad. Ignore what's up here, okay? I was getting ready for our next step. Xavier, your seat is over here, please be in it. Xavier, not in five minutes, right now. But they're doing them wrong. Xavier, listen to me.
Students will be able to define a polygon. Okay? So not only are you going to be able to tell me if something is a polygon or isn't a polygon, but before you can do that, you have to know what a polygon is, right? I've heard of it before. You've heard of it before? Anybody else heard of it before? Nope. No? Okay, well, we're going to talk about them today. The paper in front of you and up here has three shapes that they're telling us are polygons, okay? And the bottom five shapes, they're telling us are not polygons.
Whereas this is together. All of the line segments meet. Okay? Now, Richard. When we talk about that in math, when we talk about a shape like this that doesn't meet, and a shape like this that does meet... We're talking about... A closed shape... Or an open shape.
Because I want to know that you knew, and you'll get extra points for that. You know where they are. You can write it down. Now, what we're going to start with... Is I want you to see... Is that our homework, Ms. Jensen? This is not your homework. Isn't that homework? Okay. I know this is. Listen, listen.
Anyone know the math term for when two line segments meet like that to form an angle? What we call it? Right angle, vertical. They're called vertices. Okay? Where two line segments meet and make angle are called vertices, okay? Running out of room.
Uhh, no. Do you have one that is a polygon? Okay. Can I do it? Yeah. Thank you.
Polygons, they're shapes. It's the corner. I didn't ask about the corners. I want you to look at the paper. Looking at the paper. Okay, the top three shapes, they're telling us that those are polygons. Okay? And the bottom three shapes, they're telling us are not polygons.
Number eight. We're discussing the paper. What number is that? We're discussing it. Okay, okay. This one, I got one. Hold on. Do you have one that's not a polygon? I do.
There, that's what I want. Thank you. No, so boring. You know what? Okay, sorry, sorry. You're not going to be famous. Okay. All right. Until I get this on, let's take a look at the paper in front of you. We have polygons.
Okay? Umm. Look at me. Marvin? Work with Isaiah, please. Okay, you know what? Isaiah, can you bring your seat over here and work with? No, you're working by yourself if you don't work with him. Let's go. Isaiah, bring a chair over here. Thomas and Miguel, Isaiah is gonna work with you, too, okay?
So take a look at these again and notice what they have in common. Those top three. Notice what they have in common. Not going to take comments. I want to see how you guys do working this out on your own with your partner. And, and the bottom ones, you're going to figure out, why are they not polygons? What is different from the ones on top, okay?
What number was yours, Josea? Mine? Yep. What do you mean number? Look at your sheet, what number is it? Nine. What number is yours, Jamari? Mine is one. We'll put the numbers so that we all are talking about the same shape. What number was yours? What number was this? It was two. No, that one's two, that one's two. Okay.
Don't worry about it. Okay, now everybody look at the camera. Make a funny face. Stay right here, we're in your seat. Okay, now sit down. Okay. Okay, come on, now sit down. Now we need to forget that it's even there.
Let's look at... Not all, but some. Yeah. Okay, so if we're not saying all and we're saying some, do you think it has to mean? Are any of the. Lines do the shape are like, even. Like this, this is a polygon, right? This has the same height of this, and then this...
Go put a question mark, Jamari, in one that you think. Three of them. Okay. Go put the question marks in them. Put that away now. Why? Because it's not time to draw, it's time to do math. Yes, it is.
Yeah, yeah. The sooner we get math done, the sooner we get through everything else. The more chance that free time starts at 2.35.
Please don't crinkle that. All right, let's take a look up here. I know there's some that we haven't gotten up there, but I want to see if we can come up with some rules that we think makes a polygon a polygon or makes a polygon or makes something not a polygon. I'm going to wait till everyone's sitting, though, and ready. Ms. Jensen. You need to sit down. Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, I'm sorry. Ignore what's up here so far. This has nothing to do with whether it's a polygon or not.
So Jamari is saying that he believes this is a polygon. Thank you. Okay. So Jamari says this is a polygon. Okay? If you disagree with him, when it's your turn, you can put a question mark inside his polygon.
I confused some of you, and rightfully so, because what I did was I drew two circles on the board, and I put polygon over one and not a polygon over the other. But what this means is we're going to take the polygons that you have on that sheet, and the ones that are a polygon, we're going to put inside this circle, and the ones that aren't a polygon, we're going to put inside that circle. So I'm not telling you this is a polygon this isn't a polygon. So that's why you were confused.
I said I'm saying hello. Okay. And of course, we have technical difficulties. What if we press that button? I don't know. Which way is it on, Jamari? When it has the orange or when it doesn't? When it has the green. When it has the green on that little circle thing. Okay. When there's, like, a light coming right here. Yeah, okay, sit, sit, sit, sit. It's red. Okay, so let's wait and see if it comes on or not.
No, Thomas and Jamari. Okay, so let's get started so that we can get to work on. All right, somebody want to read our objective for today? I do. Josea, what's our objective for today? Students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a poly, um, polygon. Okay, stop there. Students will be able to determine. What does determine mean again? Someone raise their hand. Raise their hand. What does determine mean again?
You know what? It's not your business to tell them that they're wrong. Sit down. Josea]. You two need to stay in your seats. All right, eyes up here. Eyes up here. Did some of us? I'll wait. No point of arguing.
Okay, freeze. It's coming on, okay. Hit the first two lights, please. No, it's not. Yes, it is. How do you know? Okay. You guys are right again. Wait a second. Yeah, just two, just half. No, the other half. No, no, no. Flip them.
That way we're all talking about the same shape. Okay? Isaiah, would you like to go put up either one that is a polygon, in your opinion, or one that is not a polygon? Not. Okay, go ahead. Not is over here. Do I have someone that knows a shape that they think is a polygon? I know. Hand up only.
Then we'll be able to do it. Now, so do you see how all four sides meet? Yeah. That makes it a closed figure, so a polygon is a closed figure. Can you give me something else that is an attribute? You think something else that would be a characteristic that would describe polygons? Miguel:male? The sides have to meet? The sides have to meet, Miguel says.
So I'm going to have Richard, Nathan, and Jamari work together as a trio. I will take care of you in a second, Xavier. Xavier, you're going to work with Josea]... And what you're going to do is, if you think this shape is a polygon, you're going to write a P on it. If you think this shape is not a polygon, you're going to write an N on it for not. Okay? So you're determining if it's a polygon or not.
In order for a line to be straight, it doesn't mean that it has to be straight up and down or straight this way. It can be any way, it just can't be curved, okay? So, Xavier, is this closed? Yes. Is, are they line segments that don't cross? Yes. Are they, do they have vertices? Yeah. Is it a polygon? Yes. Yes. Let's go to. Let's go to not a polygon.
That they're line segments that meet at those corners?
I know what a polygon looks like. This is 1 minute off of free time. Shut up! Shut up, man. I, I understand that it's different having a video camera in here, but. It's staring right at me. You know what, Miguel? Then move your seat.
It's not closed. It's not closed. What's the problem here? It's two shapes, right? It's not one shape, right? Now, is this shape, if we took this triangle away, is that a polygon? If we took this square away, is that a polygon? Yes, but put them together, they're not polygons, right? Okay. Great job. Great job. Let's go back quickly before we finish to these up here and see.
What? This big line segment here, right? That's extending out from this vertice, okay? So we know this is not a polygon. What's wrong with this? Now, this is closed. It has a line segment, this vertice, but not really, right? Because what? Cut in half. But not really because what? Are these line segments? No.
It this a square, or is it not? No, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. We're not going to argue over what a shape is or isn't right now. That's perfect. And they're not going to look exactly like they look in the picture. What you can do. Umm. Where's that marker? Please? Wait, why did you give him the marker?
No. Is it the 11th? That's you. Today's 11th. Don't worry about putting the date on. I just want you to look at this for a second. Oh, this didn't get turned on. Please do not whistle. So sorry, but there's a camera. Okay, and again, camera shouldn't make any difference. Done.
Um, Isaiah, bring your desk next to Thomas. Mr. Gomez, could you work with Thomas and Isaiah, please?
Okay? And that the sides are line segments. Okay? That's a good list. That's a very good list. Can we agree that all of our polygons that we looked at on that first page here... Sorry. ...Have that in common? Can we agree that they have corners? Yes. Vertices?
Fit that s in here. You know, Miguel, I'm glad my students are so much smarter than me sometimes. Lie! Oh, no, I'm telling you the truth. Now. Now you have to walk all the way over there. That's okay, that's okay. I can handle it. Now, so so far we have that a polygon is a closed figure. The sides meet at corners.
Okay. That's a polygon? I'm asking you. It's not there. No, it doesn't, that's just, that's cool. Right. It says polygon, and then it says not a polygon. I'm sorry if I confused you. It means we're going to put shapes inside one circle that are a polygon and shapes in another that aren't. That's so easy. That's my name right here. Okay, to your seat. I don't get it, they're the same thing.
Do you have our spray? Right up there. Okay, so these polygons here. Umm, what was the question? Repeat, repeat what you said, Nathan. Oh, they all have points. Okay? What do we call this when we're talking about math? What do? The corners. Corners, okay. We're getting some great math vocabulary words here.
To decide. To figure out to decide if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon, right? Anyone know what a polygon is? Do you know? Hold on to it, though, don't tell us yet. Do you know? All right, write it down on piece of paper for me.
That's right. This is not a polygon, right? It's not a polygon. What's wrong with this one? That has crooked, like the lines. Okay, take crooked, take crooked out of your vocabulary, right? There's no corner here, right? So this is right, you were right. It's not a polygon. Okay, number twelve. That's not a polygon. I want to take a look at that. I did number twelve. Okay. You did number twelve.
I'll wait. No one's even talking. You know what, guys? I will let you know whether you can talk or not or whether, if somebody's talking and isn't supposed to, I'll take care of that.
So we can say about polygons that they have sides, right? That are made of what? Line segments. All the polygons have lines, right? Which are straight. Okay? That makes a line, right?
Sides, corners. Does anyone know, and I used this word before this might be a new one for you, what it's called when we have a straight line, the part of a straight line? What we call that? Line. Segment. Line segment. All right?
Wait. And that they're all closed figures? Yes. All right, let's look at... Our not... Jamari is very excited that he was right. Now, let's hold on. Now. Not polygons. Let's think of our list, all right? Closed figure.
Do you want to really blow it now? No. No. So make some good choices for me, okay? Yes. Yes. Can I go next? Possibly. Hold on. All right, so Richard says that little thing that looks almost like a square but not quite, right? It's open and it has a line that goes further down. He says that's not a polygon. All right? Isaiah.
Okay, so students will be able to determine if a shape is a polygon or not a polygon. Okay? And we just said that we, that determine means to figure out or decide. So we're going to be able to figure out if a shape is a polygon or isn't a polygon. Okay? Now someone read the language objective. Xavier? Students, oh wait, students will be able to define a polygon.
I appreciate that you're talking about math, but right now we're going to have a whole group discussion about math, okay? Well, Isaiah is finishing up up there. I want your first thoughts before we take a look at whether these shapes are in the right place or not. I want your first thoughts about polygons. Okay?
Why is it not a polygon? Because it, it's not even. What do you mean, it's not even? One of the sides is shorter than the other side. Did we say that the sides have to be equal over here? No. We have, we said that the sides have to be line segments that don't cross. Are there any line segments that cross in that? Yeah. Where? No, no, no. No. Is it a closed figure or an open figure? I was right on that one too. Closed. Yes, you were.
Okay. Ms. Jensen? Okay, saying that. Excuse me? Wait, no, I'm talking to Miguel right now. Saying sides meet at corners, Miguel, is different from lines of symmetry, okay? Saying that sides meet at corners. Here we have sides meeting at corners, right? Here we have sides meeting at corners. One corner, 2345 corners, right?
They're always open. Open figure. They're always open. No, no corners, no corners meet. Okay. So let's look at this. If we have as our three characteristics, I'm going to write inside of this, okay? Because this is polygons. We have closed... Line segments... Vertices. ...And vertices.
Is there something that you notice about those first three polygons on top that they have in common that none of these other shapes have? Excuse me. Yes. That the ones, the three ones on the top are like regular shapes, like square, a star.
Thomas, you asked for another pencil. Right? No, you didn't, you asked for a break. You didn't ask for a pencil, you asked for a break. Right? No, I did not hear you, Thomas. So, N if it's not a polygon, p if it is. Now, do we agree? Yeah.
So that's something that some polygons might have, but we're looking for things that all polygons are going to have. Okay? Good thinking, though. Nathan. Uhh, pointy? They all have points. Okay? So you're saying. it begins with an A. No problem. You're saying. She's been up for a minute because Rocky] needed the bathroom, but she wants me to brush her hair.
The one thing I'm going to say is let's draw them about this size so that we have enough room, okay? All right? We don't want them real giant because we need enough room. We want them big enough so everyone can see them. You can tell me in 1 second. So, Miguel. Not right this second. Who would like to put a polygon or not a polygon up there? Yes. Is this it or this not? I want to. You had a chance.
Can I switch with somebody then?
So they all have line segments. So sides are line segments. Now let's get back to what Nathan said. He said that they have corners. Okay? We said that the sides meet at corners, right? So we know that they have sides that are line segments, that they meet at the corners, okay?
Okay? So they never cross, that's the thing that we know about line segments in a polygon. Okay? Those line segments never cross. So what's the problem with this one? It crosses. It crosses! That's the problem with this one, is that it crosses. Okay? So that's not a polygon. What's the problem with the fourth one down there on the bottom?
Is this not a polygon? Yeah. Correct. How about this one? Why is it not a polygon? It is a polygon because it has straight lines. It has straight lines, what else? And it has line segments. Okay. It has line segments... ...That don't cross. It has corners, and it's closed. This is a polygon. So who put the question mark up here? Jamari. Jamari, did you?
Okay? But that's different from lines of symmetry. On first look, there wouldn't be any lines of symmetry to this figure, okay? So that's okay, it's good thinking and this is actually, you're on the right track here, okay? But I don't want you to get confused with lines of symmetry because it doesn't really have to do with that. Okay? Yes? Sides meet at corners. Okay? The lines are even. So all the lines are even?
No. Doesn't have to be green? Close to, never mind.
Another word for characteristics is attributes. So what attributes do polygons have? Okay? How would we describe polygons? I could describe Jamari as tall, kind, gentle. Right? How would I describe a polygon? One way we're thinking to describe a polygon is that it's a closed, wait a second. 1 second. That it's closed. Okay? That it's a closed figure. Okay?
You might by that time. Free time starts at 2.35 instead of 2.45. No, no. That, that's good, that means you get extra free time. Oh, see? It means you get extra free time, that's a good thing. All right. Shhh. Is it looking at you right now? Okay, yes. The camera is on. We're going to try to pretend it's not here, please. Counting down from 5-4-3-2. You shush.
And we know that that means all the. The sides are even. Okay, this needs to be recalibrated, but. Closed. I did because it needs to be recalibrated a lot. Um, I didn't give up, I'm just going to recalibrate it after math is over.
To try to decide whether these shapes here are polygons or not polygons. Okay? So do you understand what I said, Richard? Yeah. Repeat what I said for me, please. Repeat what I said. You're going to try to determine whether these shapes are polygons or not polygons. Okay? And you're going to work with a partner to do so.
Why? There you go. Can I just face? Go. Now. Again. Guys, this is a video camera, no big deal, okay? Pretend it's not here. Let's have our normal math lesson. Okay? And Ms. you know what's funny? What? We usually don't act like that since, when we're doing math when the camera is not here.
What do you mean by that? Everything meets, like, in the corner. Ms. Jensen? Sides meet at corners? Ms. Jensen?
Is it a closed figure or an open figure? Closed. Do they meet at corners? Do the line segments meet at corners? Is this a polygon? Yes, this is a polygon. You know what? It's okay. When we were, I want you to remember that when we were doing this, we didn't even know the definition of a polygon, okay? We didn't even know. So let me ask you a question, let's go.
Well, there you go. So those would be polygons. Ms. Jensen Yes. I got my name so small. Okay, that's fine.
Why? You know the rules, Richard.
And it's good to be confused, it means you were paying attention. Okay? Means you were paying attention. No, it doesn't. Yes, it does. I'll wait. 3. 2. Before it comes up three times, one. Xavier? Xavier? Yeah? Please put that down.
