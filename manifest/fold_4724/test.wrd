It'll say minus the point or minus however many points. Uhh, a negative number plus a negative number equals a negative number and that's true. So if you were working on a number line and it said negative four plus negative three, you would end up with negative seven, yeah? There are negative numbers on a thermometer. We talked yesterday about the thermometer, right? So we looked at it two different ways, right?
Yes. What? Then they have to keep spinning until they get negative numbers. All right, Alicia], did you come up yet? Yeah. Like nine, and you get, like, negative ten and negative... If you're at nine and you get negative, you'd have to move back down.
Come over here, you're gonna move the game board. That was two. You had seven. One, two. Okay. It's almost 10:00, and at that time, I wanted to start you playing partners, so we have enough time for two more people to come up and spin. So we need one for team one. So, Anthony], come on up. Yes. And then, Tyre], you can be the second one. So, plus two.
All right. In the thermostat, that's what we call it. It shows the temperature there, right? In a fish tank, you might have a thermometer, because depending on the type of fish, what temperature the water is can be really important. A lot of times at the pet store, you'll see they have these floating thermometers. You might see the people that work there, they pull it out to check what the temperature is, right?
Okay, we're gonna do that again.
They have to go negativeso, then they're behind, right? So they got minus two. Now they have twelve steps to try and get over. That was a good question. So yeah. If you land on a negative one, if you're positive and you land on negative, do you have to get another negative to move up or another positive? You just keep spinning. So you, if you, let's say even though they're trying to get positive, they got negative one, then they got negative two. So now they're at negative three, then they got another negative.
All right, Bobby], come on up. Uh...
If you were under par, you get a negative score, and that's when the more, the higher the negative number you have, it actually means you're doing better in the game. So if you ever watch a golf game, even if you don't watch the whole thing, at various points, they put up the scores that people have, and you'll see the top, the people that are in the top contention, they have negative scores because they're under par. Okay? So maybe the next time you go mini golfing, kind of try to pay attention to that, okay?
Wait a minute. Yes. So you're at negative three. Where do you need to go to? Very good. Okay, Michael], come on up. Can't move that. Yep. Plus three. Hold on, you're gonna move it. Uhh... Jasmine], come on up.
Umm, Bradley], Anaya], you're going to play with Isaiah] over at the back table. Come back here.
Usually when you're playing a board game, you're all trying to get to the same place, right? You're trying to get to the end. So here we have two different ends. So one team is going to be worried about getting a positive, positive numbers, right? The other team is going to really want to get negative numbers. Okay? One of the things that we need to do on here. What do we call this in between? What's right here? A line. A number line, right?
Segala], come on up. Zero. That's okay. Okay, Noisha], come on up.
Um. Are they up here? Yes. No, they're playing and they're playing.
Let me see, who hasn't come up in the front row?
You have a star over here and a star over here. So talk to your partner.
So, Bobby], your hand went up first. You can roll for, spin for team one first. Come on up. So think positive team one, right? Positive three. Wait a minute. Come over here. You got to move this piece, right? So he's at zero. If you got positive three, where should he move to? Three. So you can move right on the line. Very good. So I need someone from team two.
So I just want to make sure it's still working. So... Well, I don't want to press it again in case it's nothing. Uhh. So look at the game board again. I'm going to remind you what you're thinking about. Think about what do you see on the spinner. Why do you think the spinner is designed the way that it is? Think about, this says Team one. This says Team two. You see stars. One star is over on that right side of the team's line.
And we talked about that on a thermometer, we have positive numbers, and then we also have negative numbers, right? When would you expect there to be a negative number on thermometer? During what season? Winter, right? Winter is when we have temperatures that go below freezing and sometimes go into the negative numbers. So going back to the chart, it says there are negative numbers on a thermometer. We just talked about that. In golf, there are scores with negative numbers.
What's your score? What did you say? Negative one. Because there, it was expected you would need four strokes hitting the ball four times to get the ball in the hole. You only took three, so it's negative one. And the more, the higher your negative number, the better you're doing, because that's how many strokes under par. So if you did exactly four strokes, if it took you four times hitting the ball to get it into the hole, you would be on par, which means your score would be zero.
Cassidy] got zero, so we stay right where we are. Who has not come up in the back? Nathaniel], come on up. So remember, Nathaniel] now is trying to think what? Positive. Positive. Think positive, don't think negative, think positive. Got zero, so he's right where he is. Okay, Juzan], come on up.
Hold on, come here. He was supposed to move it forward. He had plus one. Yeah, he had to move plus one further over on the number line. Yeah, but he moved it to the left. No, he moved it forward. He did it at first, and then he went back and fixed it. Bradley], come on up.
So give it a spin. Okay, plus two. She did spin it. So you're going to move where? No, plus two. Very good. Considering I'm the judge and you're one of the players, you can't really make any sort of judgment. So right now, let's stop for a minute. Team two is at positive five, right?
I see people using the negative numbers. Label your number line, please. Do you remember to label your number line? Go ahead and label your number line.
So if you had, some of you may have seen. Well, hopefully this hasn't happened, but maybe you may have heard someone talking at the ATM, and they'll say, oh, my account is negative. So that means that... You owe the bank money because at some point, either through writing a check or from taking out money, you took out more money than you had. So now let's say you only had $15 in your bank account and you took out 30.
So the back of the class is going to be team two. The front of the class is going to be team one.
One of the things you might have to do when you're doing this is you might have to stand a little bit, because if you keep jerking this around, your paperclips are gonna go everywhere, right? Oh, no, no, no, no. You know anything you should do?
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10. Eleven. No, the end is at ten. You got to pay attention, Isaiah]. Now we're going to label. So the numbers from zero moving to the right were the positive integers, right? The numbers that are greater than zero. And team one's goal is going to be getting spinning positive integers. Let's label the other side. Now we're starting with zero.
Michael], can you go see if they're at the end of the hallway? Because I accidentally just pressed something, and I don't know if I turned it off. Yes. Oh, let's wait 1 second. So... I just want to make sure that this is still recording so we don't have to do this all over again. Is that? The microphone got caught on my dress, and when I went to move it, I pressed something.
Okay, Jasmine], come on up. Oh, negative two, very good.
Angel], you haven't come up yet. Come on up. That was nice of you, Bobby], to point out who didn't go. So, remember, you're thinking negative, right? Positive three. Hold on. No, wait a minute. That's team one. You're team two now. So. Okay. Uhh, who has not come up yet? Orion], come on up, hi.
Anthony], go give them. And everyone has a game board? You know who you're playing with, right? Where do you need to start your game pieces? Zero. Zero. Where is team one's goal? What's their goal? Positive ten. What is team two's goal? I'm asking you a question. What is team two's goal? Negative ten. All right, you can start to play.
Where's the flashing? This is flashing. Okay, we're going to assume it's working. Let's just keep going. Okay, so tell me some things you noticed about the game board. There's negative numbers and there's... There's positive and negative numbers on the spinner. Does everyone see that? Remember, negative numbers are numbers that are what?
They're at negative four. Now they still have to move back up. You don't skip a turn or anything. Do you use positive to get back up or negative? Yeah, you have to use positive, right? If they're trying to get that way. Even though you're on the negative one? If you move negative spaces, you're still on the same game board, right? And then you have to move this way. It's like in a game, if you were told to take go two places back, then you have to hope to roll a big number to be able to move forward, right?
That's plus two. Plus two, yeah. Hold on. Wait, are we trying to get pluses? Yes, you're trying to get pluses. So move your, wait a minute, you're going to move the game board. So you have negative two, so you're going to go to zero. Very good. Okay, who has not come up yet on this? Noisha], do you come up yet? Cassidy], come on up.
Are you saying if you're at nine and you get... Three. Three, then you just move up one and you've won. You don't have to get exactly plus one. Okay? That was a good question. Miguel], come on up. Let's see. We're both kind of in the wrong place right now, right? Team one's in the negative. They want to be in the? Positive. Team two is in the positive. They want to be in the? Negative. Table four. Orion], you need to be paying attention the whole time.
Remember, it's a game of chance because you're using a spinner. So we're always going to be nice to our classmates, right? Because we're learning the game. Noisha], come on over. Be a positive. Okay, positive one. There you go.
So how many of you watch golf? Do any of you? Or play golf? So you know that, or if you've ever played mini golf, you know there's a number of strokes assigned to a hole, right? So if you, let's say that the number of strokes assigned to a hole is three. Or four. Let's do four. That's easier. What if you only need three strokes to get the golf ball into the hole.
Go up to the, where the elmo is, get a small paperclip, because this one's so big, it's hitting your game. Is anybody winning yet. Aaron]. Aaron]? Very good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, where were you?
On the bottom. Okay, fine. Yeah.
I didn't do that correctly. Angel], there's no reason to get that loud. What's the problem, Bradley]? No, we need another paper clip. You have another one? You need another one?
Negative. Negative numbers. Now we're going to try playing the game as a group first and then we're going to play the game in partners. So we might play it a couple of times together to make sure everybody understands what we're doing, and then we'll play in partners. Okay? So, Bobby] had mentioned you need paperclips, right? So you're going to get these small paperclips, you're going to get one for a spinner. Then team one puts the paperclip right on zero. Do you see?
What happens if you're going to the positive and you're on negative ten and you hit another negative number and you're already on negative ten? That's the farthest piece on the game board, so. If you were there, yeah, you'd just stay there till you got a positive. You'd basically be losing a turn because it only goes to negative ten. Bradley] and Isaiah], you need to be focused and paying attention. So whatever you do in, Isaiah], stop. All right, so I think we'll just divide the class in half.
So I'm going to start out by showing you the game board. So this game is called number line tug of war. So.
Um, your legs need to be under your desk, please. Okay, so let's check. I want to see, does everyone have the materials they need? Uh, I'm asking you to pay attention right now. Everyone has three paperclips, yes?
Alexander], your hand came up first. So you're thinking... Negative. Negative. Zero. So what does it mean if you get zero, you stay in the same place. All right, Michael], come on up.
Why? So. Yes.
Isaiah], your hand was up first, so be careful walking around the camera. Oops. So you got negative three. Oh, wait, you're gonna move your piece. On the line. Very good. Uhh, Bobby]. Wait a minute.
The other side one is on the left side. So think about if you didn't talk about that, why you think there are differences there? They weren't there? No. You do?
So I'm going to just go over this because it's kind of light. What do you think I should probably do before starting the game? Well, yes, but I'm talking about with the number line. Yeah, label it, right? So let's start with the positive integers first because we're used to that. So what are we going to put here?
I heard somebody saying that you thought the game was unfair. I want you to tell me why. I want you to tell me what you think, using the game, how it helps you to learn about positive and negative numbers. What do you think you were practicing as you were moving up and down the number line? What operation? Or operations? Okay? And then if you think the game is unfair, how would you fix it to make it fair? Okay? So right now, pick up your paper. You can leave the game. Put the paperclips on the game board and leave it at that desk. I'll collect them in a minute.
You just have to what? You do have to use paperclips, you're right. You're actually going to use three paperclips. You're going to use one for the spinner that you'll put down. And then you'll use your pencil, and then your paperclips are going to be your game pieces. Okay? And your game pieces are actually they're going to start at zero, okay? What about the stars? Why do you think there's one star over here and another star...
But that shows that you can win when you're negative. Where are you? You're moving in the wrong direction right now? So how many places away are you from your goal? 20. 20, if you're a positive 10.
Nathan], come on up. What score does team one need to win? Three. Three, plus three. Let's see.
So you're at five, where do you go? Very good. Angel]. I mean, Tyre]. Sorry, sorry Angel]. Don't worry, when you guys are playing with your partner, you're going to keep going back and forth, so you've lots of chances to spin. Minus two.
All right, we need to stay quiet. Zero. Stay right where we are. Bradley], come on up. Remember, this whole time we're being good sports and we're paying attention, Alexander], because we want to learn how to play the game. Oh, positive three. So which way do we have to move? So you'd go zero... That's one. One, two. Okay, good job.
Minus three. Nice. You seem like five minutes.
So wait a minute. We're at positive two, where should she end up at if she got zero? That's right. Very good. Remember, from two to one is one. He was at negative one and he got three, so he went to zero, one, two. Okay? Makes sense? All right, who has not come up yet? Kobe], come on up.
Yeah, so you two can play together. You two can play together. Anthony], can you do me a favor? Can you pass out three paperclips to each pair? Quickly. You two will play. And you and...
Okay, where were you just now? Seven? Okay, so we said we needed to stop the game here. I need voices off, and I need your eyes on the board. We said we were stopping the game here. Now. Team one is at seven and team two is at eight. So if you were just looking at this quickly, you might assume that team two is the winner because they're closer to ten. Why is team one the winner? Alexandra].
They're on my desk. Make the minus. Ah, very good. What side is what?
Let me hold it for now. You finished? Who won? Three.
What is this for? I'll show you in a second. I'm gonna wait. You know you're with negative. I'm gonna claim 2 minutes. Your place right now.
Come here, Segala], you forgot to move your game piece. So is she going to move her piece to the right or the left? Left. Left. One space. Very good. Now we need another. Okay, Rocco], your hand came up next. Yep, oh. Positive three. Come here. So now if he's at three, where is he moving to? Six. Very good. Okay.
Okay. One, two, three. Let's see who's listening. I hear people talking, and you should not be. I handed you a piece of notebook paper. What we're going to do, I know some of you played two games. Some of you have played more games than that. Just leave it right there. What I'm going to ask you to do is you're going to go back to your seats in a minute, you're going to write about playing the game. I want you to tell me, if you thought, some of you thought the game.
I'm going to be around to watch what you're doing. Oh, Bradley] just reminded me, what do you need to do on your number line? Some of you already did it. Label it, very good. Don't forget to label your number line. Oh, you guys already did it, great. Good jood.
Orion], why don't you go to table three and table four. Go to table four. Isaiah], come over here. Segala], why don't you join table four as well, okay?
Uhh, I hope everyone's listening. Zero. Staying right where she is. Okay, does everyone in the back come up? Anaya], come on up. Let's see. Let's try to quiet down and focus.
Does anyone know what do we call numbers like 1234? Positive. Positive numbers. And positive numbers have a value that's greater than zero. So zero is kind of in between, right? It's neither positive nor negative. It says you can get a negative number when you subtract a bigger number from a smaller number. So an example, we did was ten -30, equals negative 20. Right?
Go ahead.
Segala], come on over, you're raising your hand nicely. So now what should your team be thinking? Negative. Negative. Get a negative. Ah, it's on negative one. Okay. No, it was between, it was negative one or positive two is more negative one.
Okay, we'll play the game for a couple more minutes, and then at that point, if we haven't gotten anywhere, we'll look to see who's closest to their goal, and that team will be the winner, all right? Plus one. Not minus one, plus one. There you go. Hey, Aaron], come on up. Table five. You need to be paying attention. So plus three.
Less than zero. Positive numbers are numbers that are greater than zero. So we have negative and positive numbers. It's unusual, right, that they put plus zero and minus zero because what does that mean you're going to do? Do nothing. You're not going to do anything.
Whichever team gets to the end of the board first. But which way. Are they both going the same way? No. Remember I said you're starting at zero, so you're both starting in the same place. But what's going to happen over here? You're trying to get to what? Positive number ten, right? Over here what are you trying to get to? Negative. Negative. So that's a little bit different than a lot of games we're used to, right?
And what is that temperature? Freezing temperature of water, that's right. 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and we talked about what was that. Average human body temperature. 212, I think it was. But you're right. What was 212? Boiling water. Boiling of water. Right? And then we talked about bath water is about 110.
And Aaron], Aaron], you'll be up next, too. Remember, Alicia]'s team one, so they're trying to get to positive ten, right? Negative three. All right. Wait, you got to move it, Alicia]. We got negative.
Remember, you need to be paying attention because you're going to be playing this game with a partner. Zero. All right, Justin], come on up. Arnina] and Davina], I know. Oh, and Aaron]. Ready? So you're going to try and get a negative. Negative three, very good. You're at five, so where are you going to go to? Very good. So you are at two now.
That one's really in half so I'd spin again. Where is this supposed to be? You're going to make sure. And where's that one supposed to be? One of the things I'd be careful of, put it on a flat surface and make sure you're keeping track of where things are supposed to be.
Now you're negative $15. Uhh. A negative number has a minus sign in front of it. So that's how we represent a negative number, right? You might see negative numbers in a game. So some of you mentioned, um. Golf, but also like video games sometimes, right? I know like fruit ninja sometimes if you hit one of the bombs will give you a negative.
Okay. So on the thermometer, how many of you have thermometers at home? Do any of you notice? Some, a lot of times you have digital thermometers now, right? But some people still have these. Uh, you might notice, depending on what kind of heating system you have, it might have, like, a little thermometer where the temperature is going up and down, or it might go across to show you. Some of you mentioned in pools, you've seen thermometers like this, that help you to know the temperature of the water.
Yeah, get a negative three, please. Plus three. So. Team 1 won this time. This is what we're going to do. Stop talking. We're going to play the game again. We're going to switch. So the back group is going to be team one. The front group is going to be team two. So what is your goal now? Positive... Ten. Wait a minute. Stop for a minute.
All right, I want you to look at this. Think about what you think the object of the game might be. Not yet. But I'm glad you're excited. What you think you might have to do to win the game. Look at the spinner at your table. Talk to a partner. Tell me what you think about this game. What do you think? But how, how are you going to win? Look at what you have. You have a spinner. You have these spaces here.
Where are they trying to get to? Negative, not positive. Negative ten. So someone on this front team, can you tell me how many spaces away are you from negative ten right now?
This side only has fahrenheit, that's what we're used to using for temperature, right? This side has fahrenheit and celsius. And you remember yesterday we glued some temperatures on different places on a thermometer, right? What were some of the landmark numbers we talked about? Do you remember? 32 degrees... Fahrenheit. Which is equal to what? Do you remember what the Celsius is when it's 32 degrees Fahrenheit? It's what temperature in the Celsius? Zero. Zero.
This might remind you a little bit kind of like football, right? Where two different teams are getting to opposite end zones, right?
So today we're going to keep exploring negative and positive numbers. I'm just going to go back to the chart we created yesterday to make sure that we all agree on the information that was provided yesterday. So it says a negative number is a number that is less than zero. So I think, Anthony], you were the one that said that, right? So Anthony]'s right. Negative numbers have value that's less than zero.
Hey, Kobe], come on up. He went up once. Now we're on everyone's second turn. So remember, what number you're trying to get? Negative. Negative. Negative minus one. All right, wait a minute, Kobe], you're going to move the game piece. Very good. Okay. Oh, Tyre] will be next. All right, Alicia], come on up.
Michael], can you please not say that kind of stuff? Uhh, and Isaiah], I don't need your help. So it's unfortunate that right now some of you are showing really inappropriate behavior when you normally don't do that. So you need to be on your best behavior every time we do a lesson, no matter what's going on in the classroom.
Cause team 2 was supposed to go to the negative side. Very good, so... Team one is closer to their goal. How far away is team one from their goal? Three. How far is team two from their goal? 18. So that's why team one this time, the back group is the winner. So does everyone understand how to play the game? Yes. I think, I think this game is rigged.
If the back row is going to be team one, where is your goal on the number line? We're positive ten. If the front row is going to be team two, what is your goal? Negative ten, right? Where do we need to start both team pieces at? Zero. Okay. So team one.
Uh, negative temperatures are cold temperatures. And we did talk about that yesterday. Yesterday we played temperature bingo, right? And we talked about in different places, you would expect different types of temperatures, right? Where do we expect warmer temperatures all year long? All year long? We talked about location. Near the equator, you're going to have warmer temperatures all year long. Arizona, because it's closer, yep.
No, because right now, on my side, you're winning. I don't like this. I'm at negative. Oh, my.
Now we're moving to the left. What's going to be right here? Negative one. Negative one. Negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five, negative six, negative seven, negative eight, negative nine, negative ten. So, and what we can see is from zero moving to the left, we have negative integers, numbers that are less than zero. And teams two's goal is going to be to reach negative ten. So what kind of numbers are they hoping to spin on the spinner?
So now you're going to switch. Segala] will be team one, and you'll be team two. So now instead of getting to positive ten, you're hoping to get to negative ten. Yes. When, when I was with the spin, um, Orion] accidentally put it up and it flanked. Okay, so go get another one up there and you need to be on your best behavior. And I think I've said that more than once during this lesson. You need to focus on what you're doing.
This is our second game. Your second? How many games have you played? Three? Who's won so far? Both times? Oh, you each won once. When you're being positive ten or negative ten? You were negative anyone? Yes. Good. Did you remember some of the kids felt like you could only win if you're positive ten?
Getting better. Davina], come on up. Uhh. One, two, three. Everyone needs to be listening. Negative two. So you're at zero. So now where do you have to go? Hey.
California and Miami, we noticed they had warmer temperatures. Where did we notice the coldest temperatures no matter? And the poles, right? The North Pole and the South pole. So today you're going to learn a game using negative and positive numbers, okay? So we're going to practice playing the game a couple times together, and then you're going to get to play the game with a partner. Okay? So it's really important, Miguel], that you're paying attention the whole time. That's why your desk needs to be cleared off.
Well, but that's not your goal. Your goal is to get to negative ten. Plus three. Good. Brad], move it. Bradley], you got to move it. You're at two. So where are you going to move to? To the 5. Very good. Hey, uh, Rocco], come on up. Come on, Rocco]. So, plus one. Come here.
Obviously, when you're playing, you're going to have to hold the spinner for your, the person you're playing with, right? Since you're playing against each other what's the vocabulary term for that? You're what? Competitive. You're competing, but you're what? What do we call people who are playing against each other? Opponents, that's right. Or foe. Yes. Another way you could say it is rival. Who just said that? Why would you do that?
Remember, we're going to try and stay quiet and focus on the game. So positive one. So what do you have to do? Yeah, so, wait a minute. You're on negative three. They're moving one, so you're at negative two. Okay. Who has not come up on this side? Samantha], why don't you come up?
It fits really well, right? It lines up. So it's the perfect size, the small paperclips. So we start team one at zero. And we start team two at zero. You always have to keep in mind your goal. Team one is trying to get positive ten. Team two is trying to get to negative ten. And obviously whoever reaches their goal first is going to win.
Who will? Kobe] will play with Bobby]. You're going to be team one, and Kobe] will be team two, and then you'll switch. You're not worrying about the other people at the table. So, Alexander], you'll play with Segala].
Head back to your seats.
Yes. Then we switch, right? Team, if you were team one, now you'll be team two. If you were team two, now you'll be team one. How's it going?
Do you think it's rigged? Well, then that's something that, wait a minute. That's something you can investigate when you're working with your partner. When you play the game with your partner, you can take turns. One of you will be team one the first time. And team two, the other partner will be team two and then you can switch. So remember the things you're going to need. You're going to need your game board, you're going to need three paper clips. You're going to need a pencil to hold the spinner in place.
Zero. Okay, uhh, Alicia], come on up. There's lots of people whose hands are raised, you have to be patient. I didn't see your hand at first. If you, if you complain, is it more likely or less likely that I'm going to pick you? Yes. Zero.
I like the way Jasmine] is sitting quietly. I like the way some people are sitting up. Nathaniel] and Miguel], your arms should be out of your shirts. Plus two. Go ahead. Very good. Okay, Nathan], come on up. When, um, Carrie] got a plus one, he moved it forward instead of backwards.
Plus zero. Okay, very good. Alexander], come on up. Excuse me, I want you to move to that back seat right there for now. So plus two. Come over here. You have to move.
