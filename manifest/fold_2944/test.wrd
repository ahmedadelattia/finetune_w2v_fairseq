...is called simplest form. Simiplest form. That's another one I'm going to have you figure out on your own using the meanings. Okay? So there are your meanings, there are your definitions. Is there a problem right here? Okay.
Three. Okay? So one half is the same as...
Numeral. Nu-mer-a-tor. Everybody say it.
You have a sheet please.
I'm gonna get a different example, not chocolate bar, for you, okay, Christian? Maybe it... maybe it will be pizza. Okay? Let's see... I want to see another way to make one half on your paper. Makenzie? Are we done, girls? Yes. Okay, label it like we labeled the first one. I label this half and this half.
If you're cutting something in half, if you take it diagonally and they're the same number on one side as there re on the other side, it is definitely halves.
It's kind of like similar. Kind of like similar. I hope you're making halves and not fourths. Or twenty-fourths. Like this? You've got... You've made... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelfths, you made twelfths. Cool, but not what we're doing. Okay?
Yep. Nominator. Oh, wow, okay, we're all gonna say this word. Numerator, say it. Numerator. One more time. Numerator. Numerator, that's right. So, three pieces each, that's the... We just said it. Numerator. Out of?
Okay, so I'm going to get it into six pieces. And I'm going to do the same thing, I'm gonna color in half. So now it's not halves I'm talking about, it's what? Sixths. And how many did I color in?
You've got to take everything out except for the one line that you're using to cut your four-by-six rectangle in half. Okay? Where do we go? Oh, wait a minute, mister. Halves, all the square unit. Come over here. Okay. I did one. Hold on. Where, show me?
If you look, this... is two... and a half, isn't it? Yes. It's two wholes and one half It's also an improper fraction. What? What? How many halves is it? Two and... How many halves is it? Let's count them. Two.
One half here, one half here. How many halves make a whole? Two. Two. Okay? This is my group. This is my set. How many are there? There's six Six. So what's my denominator going to be? Six. Six. And I... Say these are jellybeans. And I'm hungry this afternoon. And I want to eat three of those jelly beans.
We could call it a region. What else could we call it?
Denominator. You guys are getting these words really mixed up. Listen. Numerator and denominator. Listen. The three is the numerator. Can you say it please?
I just said that that candy bar had to be shared by two people, right? Right? Good, and how many pieces of candy did I say was in that one candy bar? Six. Six, so the whole candy bar has how many pieces? Six. So what do we call that number? Denominator? Yeah, because that's the number of pieces that the candy bar is in. Six. Now...
Twenty-four. Awesome. Christian, I don't know what you're doing, sweetheart. So scoot yourself in. Listen to the conversation. And cut your great, big four-by-six rectangle in half with your pencil. Not with scissors, just with your pencil.
Take a pencil line right... I didn't say to shade anything in. 'Cause if we shade it in, we won't be able to count the number of squares. No, we didn't. Okay. I am... I'm good right now, I know that Makenzie and I are going to get the same amount.
It's a whole number... and a fraction. Dante? Um... Um, five and six... six thirds. I mean... Three... Sixths. Sixths, five and three sixths, good. Giving me a mixed number. Eight and two sixths? Eight and two sixths is a whole number and a fraction, good. Caitlin.
That it, that's all you got? Okay. It is part of that whole or region. A fraction is also a part of a group of things. Or we could call it a set of things. Alright? So this is my whole region and this is my group. I want a part of that. Not only do I want a part of it, I want an equal part of it.
Yep, that's what it says. Awesome. Centers are almost over. Five minutes. What, honey? There are four centers; I didn't say you were gonna do them all today. Oh. Miss Richards, I found two ways. Ooh, show me. I did this. Yay. I did this.
And there's... eight. And there's... And there's... watch. ...two. How much do we have to split it in? Can you just hold on a second? Hold on a sec. Ayana, hold on a sec means stop, okay? Okay.
So you're gonna read the eleven fraction word problems, turn the question around, and and answer in complete sentences. Check off of the words of each question that are used in your answer. Okay? Jaylon]. You hold this one, it goes right here. Right here. Yep. Pass out paper to these six people right here in this center.
Thank you. Alright, um... Vocabulary cards. Look. Vocabulary cards. Okay? Flip them over, read all of them, flip them upside down, and play concentration. Alright? Next center right here. You know you're doing your addition and subtraction practice. Addition and subtraction?
Okay, I just cut mine in half. Cut mine in half and I made half and half, so I'm gonna leave a half over here. And half... over here. Okay? So I've got one half here and one half here.
Somebody said for eights. Michael? Five tenths. Five tenths because five is... half of ten. Brianna? Seven fourteenths. Seven fourteenths. Give me another one. Um, ten twenties. Ten twentieths. Yes, absolutely, great job. Isaac? Can I use the bathroom? Quickly.
Now, this is what I want you to do. I want you to go to your next rectangle. Now, it says four-by-six rectangle, so that means all of these rectangles are how many square units? Twenty-four. I want you to find another way, not the way that we used the first time, but find another way... to give me two equal pieces. I want...
Equal. So one fraction has to match the other fraction. Just like this set right here. I colored in one half of this square. Right? And here how many circles did I color in?
Three sixths. Okay, those are equivalent fractions. Caitlin? Or it could be like four eights. Four eights is an equivalent faction, it's half of the set. Four is half of eight. Three is half of six. One is... half of two. Wait, it is? Ooh. Can anybody give me another equivalent fraction for one half then? We've got one half. Three sixths.
It said something... it said something that's on the top. I don't think it said that. I think the point of the game is to guess. Yeah, you find the definition for a numerator. What is a benchmark? Well, where are your... what are your matches? Show me your matches. We just put them down. Oh, you just put them down. Did everybody check each other's work? Yes. Okay.
Okay, we're going to talk about what the top number is called and what the bottom number is called. Go ahead, Isaac, what do you know about fractions? Uh... The, um...
Now you have fourths. This is going straight down, okay? That is fourths, my guy. That is fourths, good job. Yep. Okay, I told this group to bring... Do you have all your matches together? And you have all your matches together? Let's see if they. Isaac. Go have a seat.
Give me a whole number and a fraction.
Christian, you say it, please. Three is the numerator. Yep. Don't star... say it again. The numerator. Michael, you say it. Six is the denominator. Good. Three is the numerator.
I'm gonna challenge you and I'm gonna walk away. Your challenge... Put your hand down. To fill the rest of these? Nope. Your challenge is to cut your whole or your region or your four-by-six rectangle into fourths. What? Okay? Listen, listen, listen first. I'll come over and look at yours in a sec. But don't we need different numbers? Listen.
If you find another way, I want you to try one more way, okay? Be right back. How we doing, girls? Good. How's this group doing? Good. You doing okay? Uh-huh. Where's... is Savannah your group? Yeah. Nice job. Did you guys go through the cards once? Yeah. Did you win? No. No? Did Savannah win?
Yes? Are you good? Okay, so now we know numerator is the... Top number. Okay, how many pieces you're shading in or how many out of that group you're talking about. And the denominator is the...
What's wrong, Makenzie?
Alright, if I were to find...
I didn't write on my hand.
Oh, right here, okay, I see that now. Good job, Makenzie. Excellent, excellent, you got halves. And you have halves here and you have halves here and you have halves here. Fourths, Makenzie. Here you go, honey. I don't know what's going on here, but I'm... I'm hoping it has to do with your center. Lovely. Kay, guys. I did it. Are you finished with your centers?
He cut it in half; I know there's twelve: two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve here. So there must be two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve here. What's wrong? Oh, the... there... you need to write the... the... how many squares are in that? No, that's not the issue. Nope, we didn't need it shaded in. Who knows what's wrong?
Oh! What's wrong? One halfs are in the wrong position.
Yes, dear. I hit my arm, now it's feeling like... Now it feels like it went to sleep. Oh, it's just tingles, you hit your funny bone. It feels weird. Can you put your name, please? Who are we missing, right? Yeah, she's at the bathroom. And Ayana, who...
Yes, you should. Okay. We're gonna take our first rectangle. What... what are the dimensions of a rectangle? What does it tell us the dimensions of a rectangle are? What are the dimensions of your rectangle? Makenzie, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?
Okay? Equivalent fractions. Um, the next word is fraction. What is a fraction? What is it? A... A region or a whole. That's not a fraction. This is not a fraction. This is that region of that whole piece. That's not a fraction, is it? No, it's a... Equal... ...lateral.
Four fourths? Four and... I need a fraction now. Take one from the board. Uh... And one fourths. Good, four and three sixths is a mixed number. It's a whole number plus a fraction. Give me a mixed number. Five and... one... half? Good, five and one half.
Who thinks, yes, if you take a diagonal line and go from one corner to the other corner, you have a half? What do you think? Do you have the same number on top and on bottom? No... yes. Absolutely. Good... look at me, nice job. Nice job.
So put your name and date, and I'll be right with you. Okay. You are working in a center here, so you may quietly consult with each other.
What is a mixed number?
I would like you to play concentration with them first. That means all of them go upside down. And you're gonna flip two over and see if they match.
Whoa, you guys are crazy. It's an equal amount of... a whole. Okay? Half and half? Quarter and a quarter and a quarter and a quarter. How many quarters is that? Four. Four. Four.
And I know that one half plus one half is the whole candy bar. Okay? Did you find a new way? I'm looking to make sure that my centers are doing what my centers should be doing.
Awesome. And which... which other ones? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Nice job, Christian. Woah, did you say you did two more? Oh, well hold on to that one. Everybody look at Christian's last rectangle. Makenzie. Michael. And Cheyenne] and Ayana.
You show me... you can put them all... flip them all over right now and just match them for me so I can make sure that you guys know what the definitions are, okay? Flip 'em all over. Good, put them in matches. You, too, do the same thing. Flip them all over and put them in matches. Yeah? Can I get a Band-Aid? A Band-Aid, what happened, honey?
Let's say that our Hershey's bar... had six sections in it. Okay? Can you imagine that in your head? Close your eyes. Oh, no, I'm not bringing candy in here. Close your eyes and think about it. Can you see that chocolate bar? Yes. I can see it clearly.
No, but sweetheart, once you stop right here and here, that's your piece. You can use halves, but it has to equal twelve square units. So this only equals one, two, three, four, five wholes and a half and a half is six. That's only six square units, not twelve. This?
Beautiful job, excellent explanation, absolutely right. So let's count and make sure each side has twelve. Why is your hand raised, honey? I don't know. I don't either. Let's... let's count each half and make sure there's twelve in each half. One, two... Count yours. ...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. On one side. And I know if there's twelve on one side… there has to be twelve on the other side. Because twelve plus twelve equals... Twenty-four.
Alright, so we've got this huge candy bar, we just cut it in half. Right? How do I know I cut it in half? How do I know... I cut it in half? How do I know I cut it in half. Prove it to me, prove that we just cut this huge...
Oh, I think I can. Take another of your four-by-six rectangles. So what do you think? I think I know another way. Show me another way; that's your challenge. I challenge you to make one more different way. One more different half. To make twelve. Twelve in one half, twelve in the other. I challenge you.
You definitely have to get rid of the lines. I'd just get rid of the... Let me see. Which one? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelfths. Nice job. Twelves, what did I say? Twelve square units. One half, you've made half. This is way easy. I'm so glad that it's way easy. This... It's easier than way easy. This is not half, sweetheart. Halves are two pieces to make one whole.
Eight and... Six... six and four eighths. Six and four eights. Do you understand mixed numbers?
Numerator. Numerator. Okay? So that whole... I cut into two equal pieces. The number of pieces I cut it into was the denominator. Ayana? And the number of pieces I want or I want to shade in or I want to see... is the numerator. Okay? So if this is one half... One half and one half, right?
What's this one?
A fract... a whole number and a fraction. Okay, a whole number and fraction. So, I wrote on the board two and one half. It's a whole number... and a fraction. That's called a mixed number. Who can give me another mixed number? A whole number and a fraction.
over a smaller denominator. Oh.
Alright, you guys. Listen. How many people? I need you to sit down, Ayana. But you know what... 'Cause then we just... You are sharing ideas here. It's not, hah, it's not good to be selfish at the teacher table. Have a seat, have a seat. That's okay, that's alright. It's okay. We're learning and sharing. Okay, what do we do?
I split one whole. Okay, so on top, you would right one half. And on the bottom you would write, uh, one half. Oh, I did that, I did that.
Ayana. Uh, Christian.
Finish your center; you've got three minutes.
You've got more than two pieces here, right? [counting] Yeah...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So is that half? Yes. Absolutely. Twelve plus twelve is twenty-four. Half of twenty-four is twelve. Can anybody come up with another way?
Okay? And the bottom number. Is the one that you shaded in. ...is the number of pieces. Or the number in the set or the group. Okay? You guys think you understand that?
And there's even twelve in this... in this box. I did this. What?
Okay? So, six is the denominator; you say it. Six is the denominator. What's... what the six called? Denominator. Denominator. Go quickly please. Michael. Denominator. Denominator, yeah. Denominator. Correct. I can't hear you. Denominator. Good. Denominator. Denominator. Perfect. So... how many pieces are there in the candy bar?
Three. How many is Cheyenne] gonna eat? Three. So three sixths... plus another... Three sixths. ...equals... Six sixths. Yeah, you're right, it equals six sixths or the whole candy bar. Excellent. What is it? May I go to the bathroom? When Christian comes back; please turn around. Yes. Alright.
Here's my whole region. Whoops. Sorry. Here it is. Okay? I could make this into six pieces, can't I?
Quietly consult. Alright, everybody has name and date on paper. Okay. Somebody tell me what's a fraction: we just discussed that. What is a fraction?
If it's a circle it's one whole? Okay, we're... we're... we're getting all of these things, we're gonna clarify them in a minute. Let's see if what we're saying is... valid or what... what we're saying is true. Any other thoughts about fractions? Last thoguht, Diana, what do you have? There's a certain way to write the, um... to write it down. There's a certain way to write it down. Okay. Alright, lots of information.
And how I label it... Is I take... the number... of pieces. I cut this into how many pieces? Two. Two. Two. Right? One, two. The number of pieces that you cut something up into to make your fraction is called the... Denominator? Denominator.
Prove it. I don't know if that's the right line; I don't if I... I cut it exactly... I don't know if I cut it exactly in half.
Numerator. 'Cause if you get them mixed up here, and you and read a paper that says, "what number is the numerator?" You really need to know which one is which, okay? So the three is the numerator.
Lots of good thinking. Then let's see if we can't clarify some of that. Okay? The first thing to know about a fraction... is a fraction... is either part of a whole or part of a group of things. Okay? We could call the whole... we could call it a whole.
vertically up and down in half, he cut it horizontally or back and forth in half.
how many pieces would each of them get? Three, and how do you know that? 'Cause, um... This is the nominator. Denominate. Yeah, denominator. What is the denominator? I don't know how to explain it, but... Okay.
The top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the... the denominator. Okay, what else do we know about fractions? Does either a fraction have to do with a half or a whole? Hold on one sec. There's fraction that you can do with a half or a whole. No, I said that, um, fractions have to do with… Oh, they have to do with a half or whole okay. What else do we think we know about fractions?
That would probably be a fraction. Okay, when a square is  broken up into four and a few are shaded in, that's a fraction. Okay, what else do we know about fractions? Let's see. What else do we know about fractions? Um, um the top number is the... denominator and bottom is the numerator? Okay, let's think about that for a minute. What do you know about fractions?
As many pieces as you cut your whole into, Christian. No, it's not because you've made... Look, all of these lines, you're cutting. This is one little piece, that's one piece. Oh. Get it? And there's twelve of these pieces with two square units in them.
Because twelve plus twelve equals twenty-four. Alright. So if you have twenty-four small squares in one side... in one half. I'm sorry twelve square units in one half and twelve square units in the other half... do you still have halves? know. I mean, yes. Yes. So let's see how else we could cut this in half. Well there's two.
Kay? That's my fraction. What's the numerator? Three. Three. Three. 'Cause I ate three of those jelly beans or I colored them in 'cause I know I'm going to eat them cause I'm hungry. Alright? So my nu... Or my fraction is three out of six. I colored in three out of six; I'm gonna eat three out of six I'm gonna get fat. Okay, the three jellybeans. Alright. So the top number is the number that you're shading in.
Because it says to... No, I gave you this paper in case you needed scrap. Okay? This is the paper if you needed scrap paper. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
W... No, it's an equivalent fraction to one half. It has to be equivalent to a fraction It's equivalent to one half. Okay? So do you understand what equivalent fractions are? Yes. Okay, they... they they cover the same area. Or they name the same part of a set.
I want a half. Look at your... Look at your paper. I want you to find another way to cut that candy bar in half. So that both Christian... No, Christian doesn't like chocolate. Both Michael and Ayana get equal number of pieces. Go ahead. Go to your next rectangle. Go to your next rectangle.
Don't forget to TTQA, alright? Okay. And my group right here. You are coming back with me first. Okay? So carefully to the back table with a pencil. Yes, Makenzie, you may use the bathroom now, honey. Carefully to the back table with a pencil. What? Can I go to the bathroom? Yep, go quick.
And I made fourths. So these fourths have how many square units in them. Four. No. I mean, six. Six. So your job is to find a different way to cut your rectangle into... Fours. Fourths. But the same is six? And the number of square units is six, that's right. Do we have a number? Yep, we do.
On the top and on the... bottom. Right? 'Cause this is half up here and this is half down here. Can I show you what I did? Good job, you just labeled it wrong. Good job, Christian. Half on the top and a half on the bottom. Cheyenne], did you have a different way? We all have the same ways. No, she doesn't; she made hers diagonally. Me?
Alright. Two thirty? Two thirty's great. Okay, boys and girls, today we're going to  talk about fractions. And before we talk about anything, I want one person to raise their hand and tell me what you know about fractions. Okay, let's see what we know about fractions. What do you know about fractions? Uh, it's when like a square... or when it's divided up into four.
Okay, because that's very important when you're talking about fractions. You're going to take an equal part... of a whole re... or region or an equal part... of a set. Okay? So I want equal parts here, my whole. How can I break that equal part up into fractions? How can I break that whole up into fractions?
Yes? Lovely. I did it. But I didn't TTQA. You didn't TTQA? Well, I'm gonna hand it back to you because that was the direction. Adam, are you all set? Yes. Yes? What happened? Oh, I... I put my chair back and it hit the desk. Did he injure you in any way? No. Thank goodness. Scoot in. Um, excuse me, Miss Richards?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Nice job, Ayana. Show everybody. Guys, take a look at Ayana's. Twelve, good work. Did you do another one? The second one, ooh, nice. Everybody take a peek. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Good for you. Any more?
Three. That's half. Half of those circles. Yes? Yes. Okay, here's one half the circle and here's the other half. This is shaded in, this is not. So three sixths is the same as... One half. One half. They're the same thing. Okay, they are equivalent fractions. I could do this with my region. Okay?
Alright, so your new task is to cut this into fours for me. That is hard. Do you think it's possible... it's possible to do for fours. Well if this is possible to do for a half, do you think this is possible to do for fours? Absolutely. Nice job, go sit down; I want to see them. Okay, if you need more paper, it's here. And Makenzie, I'm gonna come and look at your halves for you.
Alright. Yes, please. Use your problem-solving skills.
Absolutely. Okay? Would it be like possible to like make a circle and then... Hm, probably not a circle probably not a circle. Now let me ask you a question. Can we put the plus sign? How many small squares in each half? You guys should know that right now: how many small squares... how many square units are in each half? Twelve, thank you Michael. Twelve here and twelve here, why?
And come back quick. What is it, Ashley? Never mind. You all set? Okay. Alright, don't forget you are working... Shh. ...in centers.
I just made another one. I don't under... I don't see the halves. Did you do this? Boom, boom, boom, boom. There's one piece right there. That's not twelve... uh, that's not... Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope.
If there's a shape, you can split them in half. Who else has something to add about fractions? Fractions are like a piece of a shape. Factions are a piece of a shape. Caleb?
No, honey, you got to listen. So now we have six pieces in our chocolate bar, right? And if this chocolate bar had to be shared equally...
That's okay, go ahead, go ahead. Nine eighteenths. Nine eighteenths, thank you, Isaac. Dante? Um... Fifty one hundredths. Fifty one hundredths, good, good job. Okay, you guys are awesome at making equivalent fractions. That's the question I was gonna ask. What? That, um... if anything is half of, um, a num... If the numerator... Half of the denominator. Good. Um, it's an equivalent fraction? It's an equivalent...
Yeah. Yes, please. Yep, that's what it says on your... paper. Did you guys play one time? Yeah. Who won? Oh, congratulations. Yeah, I got like four. Okay. I kept on guessing, but I got it... This group all set? You don't tell the teacher that you guessed!
So I'm gonna pretend this is my new candy bar. There's not six pieces anymore, are there? No. No. So if it's a four by six rectangle, how many pieces of candy... are in this candy bar? Six. Four. Four by six. Four times six.
You can put a line in the middle or if you doing four, you can put one down in the middle... I want half, so I want.. I want to cut something in half. One line in the middle. Right in the middle, okay? I want an equal amount on one side. And an equal amount on the other side. So I just did what to that hole? I cut it in... Half. Half. So I'm gonna label that. Half. A half. Okay?
There's extra paper right in the back. Okay? This center right here... Can I just borrow that? Just the top part, hon. One second. Shh. Keep listening 'cause you're doing this first. I've gone over this already. Turn the question around into your answers. Okay?
Show me. Oh, that is awesome. Yes. Alright, let's see. Christian, show us yours. Okay, so first... You know what, I'm just gonna go over it with green so we can see it, okay? Kay. Did you check to make sure there's twelve in each? Yeah.
Because if they are not, something needs to be done about it. Isaac, what's wrong? Nothing? Okay. Okay. Let's see if we found a different way.
If there are twelve square units in a half, how many square units will be in a fourth. So you need to cut your rectangles into four pieces now, not just two. 'Cause the denominator's gonna be four.
if you two share that candy bar, Cheyenne] told me that you would get how many pieces? Three. Three, so what's... the vocabulary word for the number three? We already know that six is the denominator. What's the vocabulary word for that number three, Christian? Um, vocabulary for the number three?
We're each gonna get twelve small pieces. Okay. This is what I'm going to do next. So we all... are we all on the same page now? Are we all on the same page now? Okay, almost? Alright. Now... I cut my candy bar in half. And I gave half to Makenzie. So we're both gonna get... Gonna have to jog a little bit, right Makenzie? Okay.
And there are one, two, three, four, five halves. These are the same. Two and a half and five halves. Got it? Uh-huh. Sure? Yes. A little bit? Yes. Okay. I think the only other... vocabulary words you need to know... Benchmark fractions. I'm gonna let you figure that out on your own using the... definition. Okay?
So right here. Okay, but the thing is you have plenty of paper, so you work it out on paper. You have made a half, Christian. Two halves make a... Whole. Somewhere on your papers, boys and girls, I want you to write the number sentence. One half plus one half equals one. One whole. You made another one? Let's see.
If there are twelve square units in a half... how many square units would be in a fourth. Sh, are you listening. I need everybody's eyeballs looking at me please. Makenzie, Michael.
So we have rectangular paper, right? This is gonna be our region or our whole. Okay?
Did you make sure that you counted? And there are twelve in each side? Or each piece has twelve.
Look at your paper. Well, four times... four times six. Uh, for by six. Okay, four times six or four by six. Isaac, have a seat.
Yep. Okay. And the other halves, did you make another one? I want to make another one. I want to see one more from you. Um, Makenzie, I'm not sure what you're doing over there, but you're... you're... I made two... ...writing numbers like crazy. Show me what you're doing.
Let's count them. One, two, three, four, five. Five halves, isn't that five halves? Yeah. Yes. So this is the mixed number. And this is the improper fraction. Oh, so there's like two wholes and five halves? There are two wholes and one half. Oh.
Let me see. That one's halves. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Oh, it's right here, I'm sorry. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... I... I just made a new... It goes one, two, three, four, five... Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. I did it like this. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
You've got to have twelve square units in each of your pieces. Let me see.
What's a fraction? It's a... equal...
Nope, I want halves. I want to see halves. Go to your next rectangle. Okay, waiting for you. Find a new way. So that Michael and Ayana can both have an equal amount of that candy bar. Okay? Well, you know what?
Six pieces in the candy bar, we call that the...
Wash your hands with soap and water. I'll be right over.
